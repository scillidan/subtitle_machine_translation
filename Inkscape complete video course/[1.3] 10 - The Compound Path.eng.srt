00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,060
in previous lectures we have seen you

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,400
can group elements by selecting them and

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,099
choose group you can move and scale a

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,080
group like it is one object

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,120
we have also seen you can merge objects

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,460
together using the union operation

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,079
although the union operation is

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,240
destructive when paths overlap this is

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,820
normally what you want as we see after

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
the union operation the original circles

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,119
are gone

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,039
but there also is a non-destructive way

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,500
of merging overlapping paths called the

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
compound path

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,098
I select these two circles

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,380
to make them a compound path I go to

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,559
path combine in the layers panel we see

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,660
we have merged two paths into a single

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,379
path

20
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,540
but when I click on the Node tool I see

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,879
I still have the two original circles I

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,920
select a circle by selecting its nodes

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,739
to do this I hold my mouse above one of

24
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,079
the nodes which then becomes red then I

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,059
hold down control and scroll forward

26
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,280
until all nodes are selected

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,340
I can now move the circle if I click on

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,620
the show transformation handles icon the

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,960
circle can also be scaled I press the

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,840
space bar to go to the select tool sew

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,880
the compound path gives non-destructive

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,460
results but its real power is that it

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,580
can create holes in shapes I duplicate a

34
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,040
circle and make it smaller I want the

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
orange circle to punch a hole in the

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
green circle because the circles don't

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
overlap there is no danger of losing

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,100
geometry so I don't have to use combine

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,560
with both circles selected I go to path

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
difference when I click on the Node tool

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,720
I see I still have the two paths I hold

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,280
my mouse above a note of the inner

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
circle press Ctrl and scroll forward

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,960
until all nodes are selected we see I'm

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,579
able to move and scale the Inner Circle

46
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,979
so why does the Inner Circle create a

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,799
hole with this circle we can see the

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,500
path Direction I duplicate it and make

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,979
it smaller I go to path difference

50
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,899
inkscape like illustrator will reverse

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,759
the path Direction which creates the

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,280
hole if I select the Inner Path and go

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
to path reverse the Inner Circle doesn't

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,960
create a hole anymore because both paths

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
now go in the same direction I reverse

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,818
the path again and I have a hole this

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,860
knowledge can be especially useful when

58
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,560
handling text this text is a single path

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,200
so a compound path if I want to

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,060
manipulate the letters individually I

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,340
can go to path break apart

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,040
we see however with this operation we

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
lost the holes in the letters to get

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,239
single letters without this problem I go

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,099
to path split path

66
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,319
now I have individual letters and the

67
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,360
holes are retained I have encountered

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,099
this problem in the past when opening

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,620
PDFs containing text in illustrator

70
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,660
to make the letter e a compound path

71
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
again I make sure the larger part is

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
placed behind the cutout path

73
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,540
then I select both paths

74
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,360
I go to path difference I will do the

75
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,700
same for the O if you still not get the

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,440
hole which I haven't counted in the past

77
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,540
select the Inner Circle

78
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
then go to path reverse

79
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,420
foreign
