1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,000
in this lecture I will add the nose tail

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,819
and scutes using the pencil tool I

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,639
select it I click on the green Swatch at

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,440
the top right I click on the snapping

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,960
icon to activate it and in the pencil

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,059
menu I will activate the interactive

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,880
icon this option will let me improve the

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,340
curve after drawing it let's draw the

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,980
tail when I hold my mouse above the edge

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,320
of the body I see the text handle the

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,100
path

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,380
this means the tool will snap to the

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,199
path Edge when I start drawing I keep my

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,719
mouse pressed down and follow the Curve

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,360
when I see the text handle to corner I

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,760
reach the corner of the body I let go of

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,600
the mouse

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
as we see right now my curve is not

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,899
smooth

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,700
so I will improve it by increasing

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,760
smoothing let's try 70. now let's make

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,780
the nose

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
this time I start from the corner

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,239
I smooth the curve even more by setting

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,719
smoothing to 100. now I draw the skews I

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,180
select the brown Swatch I set smoothing

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,600
to 60. when I stop drawing I see I am

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
missing the lower part of the scutes to

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
continue drawing I hold my mouse above

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,600
the last point of the path which will

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
become red I draw below the body and end

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
at the first point of the skews I press

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,520
the space bar to go to the select tool I

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
click on Lower to bottom I will give the

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
new parts a name to quickly localize the

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,140
parts hold alt and move your mouse over

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,479
the elements I will place the nostrils

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,000
on top in the next lecture I will add

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,860
the dots by using the spray tool
