1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,580
in this lecture I will place text on a

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,080
three-dimensional object

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,500
let's create a 3D queue in inkscape I've

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,480
already created a cube before and will

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,920
show the basics

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,219
I select the 3D box tool I click and

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,800
drag from the left corner I've now drawn

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,260
a small part of the queue to make it fit

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,260
I drag a front corner to the same place

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,939
I can increase the length by dragging

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,320
one of the four nodes

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,840
to go the other way I hold shift and

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,240
drag the opposite corner and to make the

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,700
cube higher I hold Ctrl and drag a

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,920
corner I can also prolong from the

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,559
bottom holding Ctrl and I can prolong

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,600
from the front or from the back holding

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,180
the control key I go to outline preview

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,040
mode by pressing Ctrl y

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,260
if I zoom out I see it Place The

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,300
Vanishing points of the three converging

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,579
lines at the same distance using a

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,600
circle

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,820
The Vanishing points also have equal

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,559
distance to each other

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
this way you get a uniform Cube if I

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
bring a vanishing point closer to the

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,180
cube I will create more perspective

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,220
in the menu above you can also change

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,380
finite converging lines to infinite

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,600
parallel lines by clicking on the toggle

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,560
icons

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,479
I prefer however to work with three

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,299
Vanishing points for realistic results

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,520
and by dragging the little cross I can

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,799
move the cube in 3D space

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,020
I will finalize the cube by going to

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,180
path object to path

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,520
in my layers I see the cube exists of

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
six planes if I hold alt I can see which

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,740
plane corresponds with a path

42
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,900
I only need the front planes so I delete

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,640
the back planes

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,979
I call the object Q

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,860
I will flip the cube horizontally

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,740
now let's place the text to easily place

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,780
the text on the cube planes I will first

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,579
place the text on a square

49
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,439
with the rectangle tool I create a

50
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,259
square by holding Ctrl I will duplicate

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,500
it twice I select the text tool for my

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,140
font I will use Alpha slab 1 which is a

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,780
free Google font I click and type

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,020
outside I hold down alt and decrease the

55
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,000
line height with the arrow up key

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,220
I will make the text fit the square and

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,959
leave the edge visible

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,640
I will also Place text on the other

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,379
squares

60
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,780
to easily place the text on the Queue I

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,300
will cut the text from the squares so I

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,160
select the text in a square and go to

63
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,920
path difference I will give the pass a

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,580
name

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,160
I make the background a bit lighter and

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,800
I make the cube black

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,140
to place the text in perspective I go to

68
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,640
pathfx

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,680
from the menu I choose perspective

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,200
envelope behind type I choose

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,220
perspective

72
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,080
I select the node tool and activate

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
snapping

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,440
when I drag the corner nodes they will

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,420
snap to the corners of the cube

76
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,640
I may think 80 Gray

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,360
next I place outside in pathfx I choose

78
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,239
perspective envelope with the node tool

79
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,680
I place the text finally I place the Box

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
I make the Box 10 Gray
