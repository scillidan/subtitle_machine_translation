Just like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape is a 
vector graphics editing program. But Inkscape  

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,520
is 100% free! With Inkscape, as with illustrator, 
you can create logos, illustrations and artwork.  

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,440
Because the graphics made in Inkscape 
are vector based, you can scale them  

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,900
infinitely without losing quality. So let's 
download Inkscape. I go to: www.inkscape.org.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,280
On the Inkscape website you can find 
a lot of information and resources.  

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,820
The latest version is 1.2, but there already is 
a contest for the new screen for Inkscape 1.3.  

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,220
I click on: ''Download Now!''. Inkscape tells 
me I've been redirected to the best download,  

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,400
which in my case is a ''Windows Installer 
Package''. ''MSI'' stands for ''Microsoft Software  

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,560
Installer'', which is normally used to install 
and update software on Windows. The Microsoft  

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,720
installer keeps track of which products have been 
installed, and to which location. This means with  

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,519
an update of the software, it can detect the older 
version, and can preserve any custom settings or  

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,160
configurations that I applied. I click on it 
to start the download. In my Downloads folder  

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:18,360
I double-click on the MSI file. I click on: Next. 
Here I can see where Inkscape will be installed.  

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,920
You can choose not to install some parts of 
Inkscape. But I like to have all extensions and  

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,200
dictionaries. When asked if I want to proceed the 
installation, I click on: Yes. Then I click on:  

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,180
Finish. In the next lecture we'll look at how 
to customize the user interface of Inkscape.
