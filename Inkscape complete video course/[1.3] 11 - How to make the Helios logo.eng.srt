1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,399
in this lecture we'll use the shape

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,400
Builder tool to create the Helios logo I

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,820
open the logo by going to file import

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,099
I right click on the canvas and choose

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,620
document properties I click on the

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,660
resize to content icon

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,640
I turn snapping on

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,039
I click on the rectangle tool and draw a

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,039
rectangle over the logo which will snap

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,140
I set fill to none

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,599
now I will use the pen tool to draw a

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,359
leaf when I hold my mouse at the top I

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,220
see it snaps to the midpoint

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,100
but the mouse doesn't snap to the center

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,600
so I will go into the snapping options

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
and check object midpoint

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
now I click on the object midpoint then

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,100
I click on the top midpoint and keep the

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,420
mouse pressed down

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,820
I drag and move the mouse to adjust the

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,579
red line until the curve fits the leaf

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,620
then I let go of the mouse and press

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,719
enter to stop drawing

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
I press the space bar to go to the

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
select tool at the bottom left I right

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,820
click and choose swap fill and stroke I

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,939
set the opacity to 50 I duplicate the

28
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,159
path I click on the object flip

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,340
horizontal icon I drag the copy until it

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,979
snaps to the original path I hold shift

31
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,680
and click on the other path I go to path

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,040
Union next I want to rotate the leaf and

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,200
make copies of them I click on the

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
pathfx tab I open the menu and choose

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
rotate copies then I click on the Node

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,780
tool I drag the rotation origin point to

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,360
the midpoint where it will snap I set

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,479
number of copies to 18 and press enter

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,579
to complete the effect I go to path

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,079
object to path I set the opacity to 100

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,820
I duplicate the path Two Times by

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,400
pressing Ctrl D twice now I click on the

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,979
shape Builder tool I drag over the outer

44
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,960
leaves to select them

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
as long as I keep the mouse pressed down

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,820
I will create a single path to show this

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,979
I will let go of the mouse and select

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,200
the rest of the outer leaves I click on

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
finish as we see we now have two paths I

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,740
will unite them by going to path Union

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,440
I will call the layer outer leaves I

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,420
select the second path and click on the

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,700
shape Builder tool to select the second

54
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,120
row of leaves I click on them

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,720
I click on finish and go to path Union I

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,360
call the path middle leaves I will click

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
on a green Swatch to make them visible I

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,860
select the last path and click on the

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,959
shape Builder tool I select the third

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
row of leaves when I click on a wrong

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,400
Leaf I can remove it again using the

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,160
delete tool I click on finish and go to

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,519
path Union I click on a yellow swatch

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,800
finally let's give the logo the correct

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,260
colors I dragged the original logo to

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,480
the left I will delete the rectangle

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,300
that I used for snapping I click on

68
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,640
outer leaves then I select the dropper

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,540
tool

70
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,300
I click on an outer Leaf of the logo I

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,220
click on middle leaves and Sample the

72
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,379
color from the logo and I click on

73
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,560
yellow leaves and assign the yellow

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
we have now vectorized the logo using

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,780
the shape Builder tool

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,780
