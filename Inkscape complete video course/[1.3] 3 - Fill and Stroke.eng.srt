1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,280
when I draw a shape I can give it a fill

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,840
and a stroke

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,880
to hide the fill click on the Red Cross

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,460
and to hide the stroke shift-click on

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,860
the Red Cross I shift-click on black

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,200
again the width of the stroke is two

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,219
millimeter

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,500
when I hold my mouse above the value and

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,359
scroll forward I increase the stroke

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,760
width it is clear that the stroke is in

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,920
front of the fill I can place the stroke

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,539
behind the fill

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,880
I click on the stroke width value behind

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,340
order I click on the second icon

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,740
here I have text with a stroke when I

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,600
increase the stroke it will obfuscate

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
the text so I click on the second icon

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,280
the corners of the stroke are rounded

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,800
you can also choose bevel or miter to

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,420
get another look

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,860
and the text is still editable
