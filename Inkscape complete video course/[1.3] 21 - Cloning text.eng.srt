1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,520
in the last lecture we saw how to clone

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,040
objects now we will look at cloning text

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,379
I want to be able to adjust the size and

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
kerning of the percent sign at a later

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,059
point with many instances it would take

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,620
a long time to adjust all glyphs

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,780
individually so I will clone the glyph

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,980
to be flexible

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,199
I select the text tool and click on the

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,660
canvas I want the number to be right

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,060
aligned then it will always align to the

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,640
percent sign I make the font size 30

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,580
point I select the text tool again and

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,439
click on the canvas

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,200
now I want left aligned text I type the

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,840
glyph and make it 18 point I'll place

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,480
the new text on top and make it white I

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
alt click to select the old text below

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,320
and press delete

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,239
now I will clone the glyph

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,399
I lower the Clone and drag the parent

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,600
down

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,820
to increase the size I drag the middle

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,500
Arrow at the right side

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,539
this way I do not change the distance

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,300
between the texts when sizing I hold

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,399
Ctrl when I resize

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,500
and to adjust the kerning I double click

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
on the glyph I hold down alt and use my

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,780
left and right arrow keys I will make

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,700
the text a group so I can easily move

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,060
the text around I duplicate the text to

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,400
enter the group I double click on it and

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
I double click on the number to change

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
it I can now change the size of all

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,820
instances and I can turn the text and

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,380
change the height holding Alt
