00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,399
in this lecture I will add some text to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,560
the logo I want the text to stay

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
editable and also the curvature of the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,980
text to stay editable

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,160
before we used pathfx to curve text

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,019
for path effects however you need to

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,360
convert the text to a path I could also

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,820
clone the text and work with a clone

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,260
that still wouldn't give me the control

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,439
I want to rotate text I need my text to

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,900
be on a circle I select the text tool

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,240
and click on the canvas for text

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
alignment I choose centered I use Grand

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,000
hotel which is a free Google font I type

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,059
coffee Boutique I make the size 90 point

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,760
I select the dropper tool and Sample the

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,020
darker brown

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,719
now let's place the text on a path I

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
select the ellipse tool I hold Ctrl and

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,140
drag a circle

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,960
I go to path object to path

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,360
in fill and stroke I set Alpha to one

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,739
percent

24
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,500
I shift-click on the text I go to text

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,960
put on path if I click on the circle

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
again I can rotate the text

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
the text is now on top of the circle I

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,520
want to place the text on the bottom so

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,840
I want to place the text on the inside

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,100
of the circle

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,080
to do this I click on the flip

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,520
horizontal icon

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,680
now I rotate the circle

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
if I click on the Node tool I see the

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
text is on the inside of the circle

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,680
I press the space bar

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,780
by dragging at the top I can determine

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,799
the curvature of the text

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,140
if I drag the circle the text will move

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,500
with it

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,700
but when I move the text the circle will

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,740
stay in place

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,900
I can now curve the text without the

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,040
circle being over the logo

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,830
and I can still adjust the text

46
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,970
