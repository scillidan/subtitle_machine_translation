1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,100
in the last lecture we downloaded

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,319
inkscape version 1.2

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,259
ainscape version 1.3 however has big

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,139
improvements like the shape Builder tool

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,300
so I downloaded the latest development

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,160
version from the inkscape website by

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,900
going to download latest development

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,920
version

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,020
this version may still have some bugs in

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,779
it but I find it already very stable

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,400
when you open inkscape for the first

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,380
time you're welcomed by a quick setup

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,340
screen

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,439
you can do some settings here but you

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,000
can also do that later

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I downloaded inkscape version 1.3 which

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,739
will soon be the current version

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,360
if you don't want to go through the tabs

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,160
you can exit the welcome screen at the

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,120
top right

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,980
and when you press escape the welcome

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,960
screen will not show up anymore when you

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
open inkscape now let's look at how you

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,820
can customize the user interface I will

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,640
do this by showing how I created mine at

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,980
the right I have fill and stroke layers

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,920
path effects and the swatches panel to

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
add a panel click on the Arrow

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,840
I can change the order of the panels and

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,180
I can drag a panel to another place

31
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
to get more room I can collapse the

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,740
panels by clicking on the three dots

33
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,720
and I can get the panels below more room

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,240
by dragging the three dots in the

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
document properties I have made the

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
canvas called desk darker by setting

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,960
lightness to 30. then I went to file

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
save template I called it A4 dark desk

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,259
and selected set as default template in

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,720
the view menu I hit the commands bar and

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,340
the palette colors that normally show at

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,299
the bottom

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,159
I also prefer to work in full screen

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,860
mode to get maximum space in the height

45
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,920
under edit preferences windows I chose

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
remember last Windows geometry this

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,420
means that when I change something in my

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,479
UI these changes are saved here you can

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,340
also choose to see the welcome screen

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,159
when you start inkscape under theming I

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,259
have the high contrast inverse theme and

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,880
multi-color icons

53
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,799
you can change the colors of these icons

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,060
if you want

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,920
and if you have a high resolution screen

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,380
under toolbars you can increase the size

57
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,619
of the icons at the left and at the top

58
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,000
in the next lecture we will start

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,840
creating shapes
