1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,520
in this lecture we'll make a chain icon

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,980
using the shape Builder tool I right

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,379
click on the canvas and choose document

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,260
properties behind orientation I click on

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,240
landscape to rotate the document 90

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,320
degrees

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,660
I click on the rectangle tool and drag a

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,240
rectangle I will hide The Stroke by

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
shift-clicking on the Red Cross

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,740
around the corners to create a hole

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,380
let's try duplicating the rectangle I

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,779
make the duplicate green I press shift

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,640
plus control and make the rectangle

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,460
smaller we see the green rectangle

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,860
doesn't scale proportionally so I press

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,280
Ctrl set to undo let's try and setting I

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,980
press Ctrl 9 a couple of times at first

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,079
glance this looks okay

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,120
so I will select them both and go to

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
path difference now I go to view display

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,239
mode outline notice that I assigned

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,520
control y to toggle between normal and

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,039
outline mode as it is in illustrator we

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,420
will look at shortcuts in a later

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,940
lecture when I click on the Node tool I

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
see the nodes of the inset path are a

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,260
bit off to get a perfect path let's try

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,900
something else I press Ctrl Y and

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,080
control Z I delete the green rectangle I

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,939
give the rectangle a stroke and increase

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,119
its width I set the fill to none if I

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
press Ctrl y we see we just have a

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,280
single line I go to path stroke to path

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,380
it looks like nothing happened

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,960
but when I press Ctrl y we see I have

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
outlined The Stroke of the path if I

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,979
click on the Node tool and click on the

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,720
path we see the nodes are now perfect

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,060
now that I have changed the stroke to a

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,400
fill I will fill it with orange I

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
duplicate the chain element and make it

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,040
green

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,380
I select snapping and drag until it

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,140
snaps I select both elements and click

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,780
on the shape Builder tool when I drag I

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,640
see I get an unwanted connection

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,860
so I press on the X and go to path

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,240
fracture

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,100
I click on the shape Builder tool again

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,159
I keep my mouse pressed down and drag to

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,600
connect some parts of the right chain

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,659
then I let go of the mouse now I also

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,240
drag over parts of the other chain I

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
click on finish

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
like in illustrator you sometimes have

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,818
to do a little cleaning up I click on

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,560
the Node tool and look for nodes that

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,080
are Superfluous if there are any I

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
select them and press delete I will give

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,120
the chain a stroke and I remove the fill

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,879
when I scale the icon I see the stroke

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,459
doesn't scale with it the reason is that

63
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,200
proportional stroke scaling is not

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
selected which normally is what I want

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,640
when I select it the stroke scales

66
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,099
proportionally with the scaling the best

67
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,140
solution however is to outline the

68
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,660
stroke as we did before regardless

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,879
whether stroke scaling is activated the

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,920
chain can now be scaled to any size
