1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,460
in this lecture we will create the 3D

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,580
text I click on the text tool I click on

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,519
the canvas and type inkscape I use

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,400
shrikan which is a free Google font I

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,440
click on the select tool when I hold

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
Ctrl I can easily change the size of the

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,720
text I would like to curve the text to

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,699
do this I first have to convert the text

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,660
to paths I go to path object to path to

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,599
curve the path I click on pathfx from

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
the menu I choose Bend I click on the

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
edit on canvas icon now I see a green

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,540
line using the tool I can curve the line

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,880
to finalize the effect I go to path

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,600
object to path I press the space bar I

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,480
go to my layers I call the path inkscape

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,460
now I want to give the text some depth

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,520
to do this I go to extensions generate

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,399
from path long Shadow I click on live

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,520
preview I set length to 2. I click on

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,820
apply and on close we see below the text

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,699
I have a group like before I want this

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,920
group to be a single path I open the

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,979
group I click on the top path I drag the

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,540
scroll bar to the bottom and I

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,880
shift-click on the bottom path now that

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,860
all paths are selected I go to path

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,260
Union I make the path thirty percent

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,280
gray I call the path gray inkscape like

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
illustrator is very good at making

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,299
groups but I don't need them to be in a

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,520
group so I right click on the top group

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,640
and choose ungroup and I right click on

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,799
the folder where gray is in and choose

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,060
ungroup

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,759
now I duplicate gray I lower the

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
duplicate one step I make the path blue

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,579
I call the path light blue I zoom in

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,159
hold Ctrl and drag the blue path below

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,240
the gray path

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,360
in my layers I place blue below Gray

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,000
I hold Ctrl and drag the blue path up

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,799
until it is roughly a quarter of the

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
size of Gray

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
I click on fill and stroke I change the

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,259
color a bit more to Blue

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,320
now I duplicate gray I click on Lower to

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,860
bottom I go to path Dynamic offset I

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,960
click on the Node tool above the letter

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
K there is a no I drag the note up to

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,819
make the path larger

52
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,040
to finalize the effect I go to path

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,760
object to path I hide the other paths I

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
see the new shape has some holes in it

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,920
to remove them I go to path break apart

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,980
then I go to path Union I will make the

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,440
path a darker blue I drag the blue a bit

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,099
more to cyan I call the path dark blue I

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,959
want a shape to go from dark blue to

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:34,920
light blue

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,500
I right click on dark blue and choose

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,920
set clip group I click on the pen tool I

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,900
click on the canvas click somewhere else

64
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,019
and press enter I now have a line I

65
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,180
click on the Node tool when I drag the

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,640
line in the middle I can bend the line I

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,739
will drag the end nodes outside the dark

68
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,260
blue area at the bottom left I will

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,760
increase the width of the line to about

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
75. I click on the dropper tool and

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
shift-click on light blue I will call

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
the path light blue line I click on fill

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,560
and stroke and click on stroke paint I

74
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,319
set blur to 30. I click on the Node tool

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,840
to get the curve right I drag the lineup

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,900
to move the line I press Ctrl a to

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,420
select both nodes then I drag one of the

78
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,599
nodes

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,379
I want to be able to drag the text

80
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,900
independent from the gradient so I

81
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,819
select the text related paths and group

82
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,519
them now I can move the text up to get a

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,280
more 3D look I also want the gradient to

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,099
be 3D so I duplicate it I drag the

85
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,019
duplicate on top in the layer and click

86
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,420
on Lower to bottom I go to extensions

87
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,780
generate from path long Shadow I set

88
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,599
length to 7. I click on apply and on

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
close I place the group on the bottom as

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
before I will unify the 3d effect into a

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
single path I open the group I click on

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,760
the top path I drag the scroll bar to

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440
the bottom and I shift-click on the

94
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,980
bottom path I go to path Union and as

95
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,780
before I don't need them to be in a

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,700
group so I right click on the top group

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,860
and choose ungroup

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,720
and I right click on the folder where

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,260
the 3d effect is in and choose ungroup I

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,019
will call the New Path long Shadow I go

101
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,940
to fill and stroke and make long Shadow

102
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,339
a bit darker to see the long Shadow

103
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,860
better I will add a gradient I will use

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,259
dark blue for that I make dark blue

105
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,680
black I call the path gradient I go to

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,580
fill and stroke I set blur to 25 I will

107
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,280
use long Shadow to clip the gradient I

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,560
right click on it and choose set clip

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
group I drag gradient in the clip group

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,259
I lower its opacity to 75 percent

111
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,120
I also would like a shadow below the

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,900
text

113
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,660
so I duplicate inkscape I click on black

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,300
I set blur to 10 percent

115
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,840
I call the path Shadow I press Ctrl and

116
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,479
drag it down I click on Lower to bottom

117
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,880
I can also move the Shadow with my arrow

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,580
keys to move in smaller increments hold

119
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,259
the ALT key while pressing the arrow

120
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,320
keys finally I will place a shadow below

121
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,840
the whole text object I duplicate dark

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,900
blue I drag it on the top of the layer I

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,660
call the path Shadow below I make it

124
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,380
black I set blur to 30. I press Ctrl and

125
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,960
drag the shadow down I click on Lower to

126
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,660
bottom and with my arrow keys I can

127
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,440
position The Shadow
