1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,560
let's say you have many objects that are

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,880
the same and at a later point you want

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,879
to adjust them then you could use

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,400
cloning let's create a custom

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,120
bullet I select the rectangle tool and

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,080
drag a rectangle to get rounded Corners

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,960
I drag the circle shape control widget

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,480
down I want the rectangle to stay alive

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,400
shape so I will not convert it to a path

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,119
I press the space

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,840
bar in my layers I will set the blend

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,439
mode to multiply now I will clone the

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,759
rectangle

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,920
you clone an object by pressing alt d i

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,680
drag the Clone down for my bullet I need

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,000
a second rectangle so I will clone the

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
original again I click on the rectangle

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,079
again so I can rotate it I hold control

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,280
and rotate at

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,239
90° I turn on snapping and open the menu

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,960
I want the corners of the bounding boxes

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,000
to snap I select both rectangles and

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,760
click on them again so I can rotate I

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,960
hold control and rotate 45°

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,760
I want to add a third rectangle and I

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,239
want the two clones to mask it so I

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,479
right click on the rectangles and choose

28
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,439
set clip group now I clone the original

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,159
again I drag the Clone in place to mask

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,759
I drag the Clone on the clip group now

31
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,759
let's say I want the rectangles to be

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,640
shorter to do this I drag the left side

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,759
of the original end because the

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,720
rectangle is still Al live shape the

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,400
corners will stay round after scaling

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,920
now I select the bullet and clone it we

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,479
see the Clone now is a single shape I

38
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,640
will create a layer for it and call it

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,200
bullets I call the other layer parents I

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
drag the single- shaped bullet on the

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,240
bullet's layer I select the parent

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,000
objects and drag them on the paste board

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,119
now I will hide them I don't have to

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,200
clone the newest object anymore I can

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,439
just duplicate it I will activate

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,280
alignment and select same distances I

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
can now duplicate instances of the

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,159
Bullet by pressing the space bar

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,200
now let's say I want the bullets to be

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,159
smaller I show

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,399
parents when I make the parent bullets

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,318
smaller the children will follow I hold

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,360
shift plus control while scaling and to

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
change the color of the bullets I select

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,879
the original rectangle in fill and

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
stroke I adjust the color and I make the

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
arms of the bullets a bit shorter
