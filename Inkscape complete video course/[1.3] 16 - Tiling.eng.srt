1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,760
in this lecture I will make another 3D

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,220
text effect using tiling to easily

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,379
create a pattern I click on the text

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,280
tool and type 3D text I use shrikan

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,219
which is a free Google font I duplicate

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,740
the text and drag it below I double

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,380
click on it to get to the text tool I

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,439
press Ctrl a and type inkscape

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,260
click on the select tool I hold Ctrl and

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,300
drag the right side in to match the size

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,820
of the text above now I drag the text

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,800
above to the right so that the T and the

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,480
E show a straight line

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,219
I would like to have some curvature in

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,680
the text to do this I have to convert

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
the text to paths I select them both and

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,719
go to path object to path

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,379
to curve 3D text I go to pathfx from the

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,200
menu I choose envelope deformation I

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,239
click on the edit on canvas button at

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,760
the right of bottom band path now I see

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
a green line at the bottom of the text I

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,199
can drag the line to curve the text at

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,760
the bottom

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,460
now let's curve the text below I go to

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
pathfx and choose envelope deformation I

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,100
select the edit on canvas button at the

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,979
right of top end path I control drag the

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,380
left note up and I drag the green line

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,460
down

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,340
I also control drag to write note up I

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,260
dragged the green line down again

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,540
I see I can drag the left note a bit

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,939
further up and I can drag the green line

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,780
a bit further down

36
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,979
I want to compress the text a bit so I

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,299
select them both

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,820
I drag the text a bit in

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,040
to finalize the effect I go to path

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
object to path

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,240
now I will make them a single path

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
I want the 3d effect to go from light

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,220
blue to a darker blue I duplicate the

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,680
text and give it a darker blue I hold

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,720
shift and control and make the duplicate

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,180
smaller I shift-click on the larger text

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,520
I want to create a transition from One

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,140
path to the other

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,540
I go to extensions generate from path

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,659
interpolate between paths I will make 50

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,759
copies in between them and click on live

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,899
preview

53
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,899
I click on apply and on close in my

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,119
layers I see a new group which are the

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,640
transitioning paths I will place the

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,400
original light blue text on top and I

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,140
will make it dark blue

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,379
I call the path top text I duplicate top

59
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,260
text and call it pattern I go to fill

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,599
and stroke and for the fill I choose

61
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,739
pattern

62
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,400
for my pattern I choose abstract one now

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,620
I will make my own pattern I click on

64
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,500
the ellipse tool I hold Ctrl and drag a

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,920
small circle I go to pathfx I choose

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
tiling I will make 30 rows and 60

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,060
columns

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,220
to get smaller circles at the top and

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,440
larger circles at the bottom I set scale

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,540
to seven percent and I want to shift

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,000
each row 50 percent so I set offset to

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,640
50. I zoom out and I will size the

73
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,920
pattern to fit the text I will make the

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,000
pattern White

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
to get the pattern covering the 3d

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
effect I right click on the group and

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,120
choose set clip group

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,000
I name the pattern circles I drag

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,700
circles on the clip group I set the

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,879
opacity of circles to 25 percent with my

81
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,099
arrow keys I now choose which part I

82
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,319
like best of the circles I can also

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,319
resize to get larger or smaller circles

84
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,900
I will create a black background I click

85
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,879
on the rectangle tool and drag over the

86
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,640
canvas I press the space bar and click

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
on Lower to bottom to make the edges

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,080
visible I will add some Strokes

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,379
I duplicate top text in my swatches I

90
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,900
click on none and I shift click on White

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,659
at the bottom right I scroll backwards

92
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,120
to set the stroke to half a millimeter

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,180
I call the path white I duplicate the

94
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,120
path twice I call the top layer blue and

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,459
shift-click on the light blue Swatch I

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,040
hide blue I click on white go to fill

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,860
and stroke and stroke paint I set blur

98
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,799
to 10 percent I call the path white blur

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,739
I shift click on white and choose group

100
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,379
I drag the group a bit down

101
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,599
I reveal blue and scale it from the

102
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,840
bottom
