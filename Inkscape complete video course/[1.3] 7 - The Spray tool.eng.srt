1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,639
now let's Place some dots

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,160
I will use the spray tool for this I

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,319
start by drawing an ellipse and I will

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,599
give it an orange color I right click on

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,179
the Swatch and choose pin color

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,519
now I copy the ellipse to place it in

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,520
memory then I select the spray tool I

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
click on spray clones of the selection

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,300
so I can manipulate the result

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,500
afterwards

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,960
I do not want the dots to overlap

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,760
so I click on prevent overlapping

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,900
objects

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,720
the orange circle is the spray area to

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
make the spray area larger increase

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,340
width the rest of the values are all

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,980
maxed out to get maximum variation

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,860
when I spray I see I get very small and

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,320
very large ellipses I need the dots to

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,260
be more uniform so I set scale to 50.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,579
this is better

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,340
also on average the dots are a bit too

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,239
large

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,579
so I press the space bar to go to the

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,039
select tool if I make the parent ellipse

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,620
smaller the children will follow this is

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,680
about right now I spray over the body if

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
I don't like a result I click control

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,240
set and spray again and I can still

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
change the color I delete the original

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,159
to place the ellipses in a group I right

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,040
click on one then I choose select same

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,540
fill color

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,900
I right click again and choose group

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,659
I will call the group dots in the next

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,340
lecture we will shade the drawing
