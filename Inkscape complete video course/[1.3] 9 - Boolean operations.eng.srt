1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,879
in the last lecture I used two Boolean

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,000
operations Union and difference in this

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
lecture we will look at the different

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,320
Boolean operations with Union you can

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,000
combine different paths into a single

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
path here I have two circles and a

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,920
rectangle with rounded Corners I select

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,160
the three elements and go to path union

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,859
now I have a cloud the second Boolean is

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,619
difference the Apple logo has a bite out

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,199
of it the top Circle will be subtracted

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,699
from the Apple below

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,859
with intersection only the parts that

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,660
overlap remain

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,700
with just two circles you can make a

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,160
leaf exclude does the opposite as

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
intersection overlapping parts are

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
excluded from the end result creating

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
holes division is the same as

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,860
intersection but will keep the parts

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,020
coming from the bottom object

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,239
so with the X on top of the circle the

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,100
parts of the x that stick out are

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,860
removed but with a circle on top the X

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,420
will determine the cutout and

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,460
non-overlapping circle parts are removed

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,579
cut path is for cutting strokes this

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,920
means the fill will be removed and the

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,680
stroke of the apple is cut into pieces

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,299
fracture is the same as intersection and

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,820
division but now all parts remain

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,979
to create a heart shape I drag a

33
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,560
rectangle and round the corners I press

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,780
the space bar to go to the select tool

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,240
when I click on the rectangle again I

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,180
can rotate the object when I hold Ctrl I

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,700
can rotate in 15 degree increments I

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
will rotate 45 degrees I duplicate the

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
shape I click on the flip object

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
horizontal icon I hold Ctrl and move

41
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,799
them a bit closer I select them both and

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,500
go to path fracture by holding down the

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,079
ALT key I can select the heart shape I

44
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,840
go to path union now I can remove the

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,420
parts I don't need and finally you have

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,399
flattened which is the same as fracture

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,020
but will only make Cuts there where

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,740
lines are visible
