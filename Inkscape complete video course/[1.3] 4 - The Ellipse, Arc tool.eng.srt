1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,520
let's create this crocodile with simple

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,860
shapes

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,680
I drew this crocodile in I will

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,540
import this drawing in inkscape and

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,900
vectorize it I go to file import

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,780
I select the sketch and click on open

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,480
I click on OK I want to resize the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,699
canvas to match the size of my drawing

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,520
to do this I right click and click on

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,019
document properties

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,420
then I click on the resize to content

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,439
icon

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,260
I zoom in by pressing Ctrl and scrolling

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,960
forward and I can pan by pressing the

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,600
middle Mouse button and drag to be able

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,640
to see both the drawing and the artwork

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,340
I will create a new layer I click on the

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,040
add layer icon and click on ADD

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,899
I will place the layer below the layer

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
with the drawing by clicking on the move

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,280
down in the stack icon I hold my mouse

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,320
above layer 1 and click on the Square

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,620
icon I set the layer to multiply so I

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,360
can see the layer below and I can look

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
through the drawing

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
I will also set its opacity to about 15

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,559
and I will lock the layer so the drawing

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,020
can't be moved I will start by drawing

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,540
the eyes which are made of circles I

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,119
will create them with the ellipse tool I

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
zoom in on the left eye I drag and also

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,220
hold down the control key so I get a

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,420
perfect circle

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,820
each shape you draw can have a fill in a

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,580
stroke to give the circle a fill color I

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,020
can click on a color in the swatches

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,479
panel and to give the circle a stroke

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,180
color you shift-click on a color notice

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,700
the used fill color swatch has a dot in

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,280
it and the stroke color swatch is

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
indicated with a larger circle line

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,140
so how do I remove the stroke I remove

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,299
The Stroke by shift-clicking on the Red

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,939
Cross the Red Cross now shows the circle

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,020
line

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,700
I also want a slightly different green

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
for my fill

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,000
although the dot and circle line make it

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,100
easy to find back the used colors I

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,540
would like to have the used colors at

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,720
the top for easy access to do this I

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,119
right click on the Swatch and choose pin

53
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,780
color

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,759
now let's finish the eye

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,439
with the ellipse tool I can make the

56
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,719
circle larger but I prefer to do this

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
with the select tool because then I can

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,380
drag from every corner

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,540
so I drag a corner while holding down

60
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,000
control to keep the circle round

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,640
now I press Ctrl D to duplicate the

62
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,160
circle the duplicate is placed exactly

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,780
on top of the original

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,000
I make the copy white by clicking on the

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,220
white Swatch now I will make the eye

66
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,500
smaller to scale the circle from the

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,840
center I hold Ctrl shift press down

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,060
while dragging although the pupil is

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,860
black to see what I am doing I will

70
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,660
temporarily choose Gray

71
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,060
the pupil is not round so now I will

72
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,220
drag from the sides to make the

73
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,019
reflection I will duplicate the white

74
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,080
circle I hold Ctrl and drag it in place

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,379
I will now make the pupil black I press

76
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,480
Ctrl and scroll backward to zoom out

77
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
let's copy the left eye and reuse it for

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,879
the right eye in the layers panel we see

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,819
the eye is created with four circles to

80
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,040
copy them and move them together I will

81
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,500
make them a group I drag over them to

82
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,660
select them all I right click on the

83
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,360
selected items and choose group

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
in the layers panel we see we now have a

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,459
group I can open and close the group and

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,140
I can give the group a name by double

87
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,500
clicking on it I type left eye we see

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
the group behaves as if it is a single

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,140
object

90
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,659
so I will press Ctrl D to duplicate the

91
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,819
group and I will place the copied group

92
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,040
over the other eye I will call the new

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,620
group right eye now I reuse the group

94
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,379
once again to make the nostrils I press

95
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,379
Ctrl D once again to duplicate the group

96
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,300
the nostrils don't need the pupils and

97
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,940
highlight so I can remove these to do

98
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,099
this I will ungroup the group

99
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,959
I click on the highlight and press

100
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,959
delete and I also delete the pupil

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
the nostrils like the scutes are brown

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,540
so I click on the white circle and in my

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
swatches I choose a brown

104
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,040
I right click on the Swatch and choose

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
pin color now I select the two circles

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,099
right click and choose group I will

107
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,560
scale the nostril down and place it

108
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,900
I press Ctrl D and position the other

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,040
nostril

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,019
I hold shift and click on the other

111
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,720
nostril to select them both I right

112
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,839
click and choose group I now have two

113
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,418
groups placed in a new group I will call

114
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,540
the group nostrils for the belly I drag

115
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,580
another ellipse I click on a yellow

116
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,340
Swatch I right click on the Swatch and

117
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,340
choose pin color finally I make the

118
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,620
mouth with the ellipse tool to use the

119
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,840
ellipse tool for scaling drag one of the

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,419
two squares and to move the circle drag

121
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,940
the cross in the middle until now we

122
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,440
have only used fill colors for our

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,960
circles in the swatches panel I can see

124
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,940
that my circle has no stroke

125
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,040
to add a stroke I shift-click on a

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,199
Swatch I need the stroke to be the same

127
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,660
width as the mouth I click on the fill

128
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,699
and stroke Tab and then on stroke style

129
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,300
a width of 0.5 millimeter looks right to

130
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,280
remove the fill color I click on the Red

131
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,580
Cross now the circle only has a stroke

132
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,740
with the ellipse tool I can drag the

133
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,720
little circle at the right in two ways

134
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,600
if I drag and hold my mouse outside of

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,240
the circle I can create pie charts and

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
when I drag while holding my mouse

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,440
inside the circle I can create Arc lines

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,740
behind cap I choose round cap so that

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
the line will be rounded at the edges I

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,000
shift-click on the black Swatch to make

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,259
the stroke black

142
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,300
in the next lecture we will look at the

143
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,139
rectangle tool

144
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,780
foreign
