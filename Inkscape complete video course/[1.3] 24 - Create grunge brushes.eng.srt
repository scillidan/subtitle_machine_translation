1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,120
in this lecture I will make my own

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,200
grunge brush and use it to make a vector

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,399
sticker I will create the brush from an

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,000
image I go to file import I open an

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,040
image with waterfalls that I downloaded

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,839
from

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,160
pixabay to better see the potential of

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,520
the water I go to filters

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,560
grayscale I lower the lightness I will

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,279
use the water on the left I click on the

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
rectangle tool and select a piece of the

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
water I hold shift and also select the

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,238
image I right click and choose set clip

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
now I will trace the water to prevent

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,600
tracing the whole image I right click

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,480
and choose crop image to clip I right

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,600
click again and choose Trace bitmap to

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
get the largest preview possible I will

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,879
drag the trace bitmap Tab out of the tab

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,399
group and I will adjust the window to

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,640
the top and bottom of my screen for

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,559
detection mode I will choose brightness

23
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,399
cut off with threshold I determine how

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,320
much of the water gets

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
white I will set threshold to 0.5 I will

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,599
click on invert to get a black brush I

27
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,560
click on apply I now have a black brush

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,200
I will call the path brush I will delete

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,920
the

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
image I will remove some water from the

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,240
bottom and from the side to do this I

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,680
select the node tool I will also remove

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,960
the nodes that are at the

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,520
edges the brush is finished and I will

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,479
rotate it to make it

36
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,479
horizontal now I will drag a circle I

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,680
will duplicate the circle twice

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,880
I select the brush and copy it I will

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,280
hide two of the three circles I go to

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,000
path effects from the menu I choose

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,759
pattern along path behind pattern I

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
choose single stretched I click on the

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,240
paste path icon to make the brush a bit

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,240
thinner I use the edit on canvas tool I

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
drag the handle in in my layers I reveal

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,439
the other Circle and make it a bit

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,680
smaller to apply the effect I go to path

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,159
object to path to make the circle and

49
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,119
the edge interact I shift click on the

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,200
circle then I go to path

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,479
exclusion now the circle in the edge or

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,040
a single path I will place some text I

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,920
select the text tool and click on the

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,599
sticker I use Grand hotel which is a

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,319
free Google font I type best to make the

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,080
text italic I can skew the text and for

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,800
the text below I will use verella round

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,319
which also is a free Google font to make

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
the text more bold I shift click on

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
White at the bottom left I make the

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,959
stroke

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,400
smaller finally I want to add a grunge

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,760
stroke I will make the last Circle a bit

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,920
smaller and I give it a white stroke I

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
make the stroke thinner to get a grunge

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,400
stroke I use two path effects first I

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,280
will choose taper stroke and then I will

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,920
add roughen you can try out different

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,599
looks by clicking on the receipt icon
