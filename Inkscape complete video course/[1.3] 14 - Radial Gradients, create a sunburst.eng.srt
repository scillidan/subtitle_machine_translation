1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,820
in this lecture and the next one we will

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,160
make a 3D text effect on a Sunburst

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,000
background

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,919
we will start by making the Sunburst

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,559
background using radial gradients I

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,420
right click on the canvas and choose

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,179
document properties I set the canvas to

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,199
landscape

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,060
I activate snapping

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,520
I click on the rectangle tool I drag

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,160
over the canvas where it will snap now

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,619
let's create a radial gradient I click

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,900
on the fill and stroke tab I click on

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,779
radial gradient for the inside color I

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:31,980
pick an orange

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,020
and for the outer color I will select

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,660
red I want to bring the outer color more

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,680
to Orange

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
to go from red to orange I will drag the

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
Hue to the right you can also drag on

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,059
the outer ring of the color wheel and

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,860
for fine tuning you can click on the

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,379
plus and minus icons I can't see the

24
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,600
inner gradient color very well so I will

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,539
drag its Hue more to Orange I also want

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,879
the color to be a bit lighter to do this

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,460
I drag the lightness by dragging the

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,500
endpoints I can change the dimensions of

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,019
the radial gradient now that we have our

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,479
gradient let's create the Sunburst I

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,240
click on the star polygon tool like the

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
rectangle and ellipse tool the start

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
tool is a live shape I can make spikes

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,939
longer and shorter

35
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,740
and I can increase or decrease the

36
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,500
amount of spikes to get a triangle I

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,780
need three corners and I need the spoke

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,500
ratio to be 0.5 I drag then press Ctrl

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,479
and rotate until the triangle points

40
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,320
down

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,780
to use a path effect it is best to use a

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,979
regular path

43
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,439
to turn a live shape to a regular path I

44
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,380
go to path object to path now I hold

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,320
shift and drag the side in I drag the

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,840
triangle to the center until I see cusp

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,579
node to object midpoint

48
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,380
now I want to copy and rotate the

49
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,400
triangle

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
I click on pathfx from the menu I choose

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,479
rotate copies I click on the Node tool I

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,579
drag the rotation origin point to the

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,040
midpoint where it will snap I want the

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
beams to be larger so I drag over the

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
points I select show transformation

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,479
handles for selected nodes I scale the

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,520
beam until all beams are outside the

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,360
rectangle I set number of copies to 28 I

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,879
hold shift and drag aside to adjust the

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,099
width of the beams I don't want black

61
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,800
but white transparent beams so I click

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,780
on the white Swatch then I go to my

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,879
layers to set the opacity

64
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,819
I set opacity to 50 to get a better

65
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,800
blending with a gradient I set the blend

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
mode to soft light

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,340
now I want to hide the beams that go

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
outside the gradient I right click on

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,500
the gradient and choose set clip group I

70
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,420
drag the Sunburst above the clip folder

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,660
I name the path beams and I name the

72
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,180
rectangle gradient now I want to place

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,800
some sunlight at the top

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,900
I click on the ellipse tool and drag an

75
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,860
ellipse

76
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,000
I click on yellow I set blur to 50 I

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,620
drag the yellow inside the clip group

78
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,080
and place it below the beams I hold

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,360
shift and drag the side so that the

80
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
yellow covers the top of the Sunburst I

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
drag the top and bottom handles to place

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,620
the sunlight I name the shape sunlight

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,840
and the layer Sunburst in the next

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,819
lecture we will create the 3D text
