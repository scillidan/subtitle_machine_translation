1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,300
in inkscape 1.3 there are new on canvas

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,920
blur controls

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,799
let's make a logo using directional blur

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,380
I will create a black background then I

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,179
select the text tool and click on the

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
canvas I will use Montserrat extra bold

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,460
which is a free Google font I type

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,900
inkscape

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,939
for the text I will have no fill but

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,220
only a stroke I want to have a gradient

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,279
inside the stroke I open fill and stroke

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,800
and stroke paint I click on linear

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,760
gradient

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,640
I want my gradient to have four colors I

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,380
imported a screenshot of the colors I

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,100
used

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,559
I will sample them with a dropper tool

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,200
for the left color stop I hold shift and

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,399
click on the Green

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,440
and for the right color stop I hold

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
shift and click on the yellow

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,940
now I will create two extra color stops

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,579
I can do this by double clicking on the

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,539
gradient

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,640
and I can drag the color stops or

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,440
position them numerically

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
I make the second color stop blue and

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
the third color stop I make magenta now

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
let's give the text the directional blur

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,119
for the blur I will duplicate the text

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,400
I go to fill and stroke and stroke paint

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
I set blur to 30.

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,560
I only want the blur to be horizontal so

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,960
I select the node tool I will remove the

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,460
vertical blur Direction

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,560
and I will reduce the opacity to 50

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,700
percent

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,860
I call the path blur

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,600
now let's give the text some accent

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,360
light I duplicate the text and call it

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,820
accent I make the stroke white and

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,040
reduce the stroke width I want the white

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,740
accent to fade out to the bottom to do

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,780
this I will apply a mask

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,119
I drag a rectangle over the text which

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,439
will become the mask

47
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,900
in a mask white reveals and black

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,600
conceals so I will give the rectangle a

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,119
gradient from white to black I go to

50
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,640
fill and stroke and click on fill I

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,380
click on linear gradient

52
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,960
I position the gradient vertically the

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,659
bottom has to hide so I make it black

54
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,820
and the top has to be visible so I make

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,579
it white I cannot actually see how the

56
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,259
end result will look like

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,780
to easily tweak the actual result I will

58
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,619
clone the rectangle

59
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,599
in my layers I select the Clone in the

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,860
accent text

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
I right click and choose set mask I can

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
now adjust the gradient and see the

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,440
result it has on the accent text

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,900
I place the original on the bottom

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,940
I will place the Mast accent in a group

66
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,400
to make the effect stronger I will make

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,540
some copies

68
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,520
finally I will make a colored background

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
I will use the same colors I used for

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,180
the text

71
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,700
I duplicate the background I go to fill

72
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,160
and stroke and click on fill

73
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,140
I will reuse the gradient that I made

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,459
for the text

75
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,800
behind gradient I open the menu and

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
click on the gradient

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
I can get the gradient a name

78
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,860
I will use a mask to fade out the

79
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,879
gradient

80
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,420
I drag an ellipse and make it white

81
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,400
to be able to tweak the result I will

82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,940
make a clone

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
I blur the original

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,840
I place the original on the bottom

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,060
I select the Clone and shift-click on

86
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,519
the gradient to select them both

87
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,300
I right click and choose set mask

88
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,760
I position the gradient

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,459
and place the gradient below the text

90
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,459
and I lower its opacity

91
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,680
by adjusting the original mask I can

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,280
adjust the result
