00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
let's look at how to make this logo a

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,920
convenient way to do this is to use the

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,000
power stroke

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,820
it wasn't until Illustrator CS6 that you

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,380
were able to create a variable stroke

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,219
width

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,960
it's a powerful tool to have in your

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,660
Arsenal so let's have a look

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,640
select the ellipse tool and drag a

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,820
circle

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,739
[Music]

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
I will make the start and end points fit

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
the large Arc

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,059
I go to pathfx and choose power stroke

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,920
I want the start and end cap to be

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,280
rounded

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,040
I drag the purple control point to

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,760
adjust the width

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,920
I lower the opacity so I can clearly see

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,600
both shapes

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,719
[Music]

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
I zoom in on the start point

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,900
I fine tune the end point

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,780
at this moment I have three points to

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,280
adjust the line width

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,580
but you can remove and add points

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,860
to add a control point I control click

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,479
on a purple diamond

29
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,340
now I have four points to control the

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,759
line with

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,860
I will create a fifth control Point by

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,799
control clicking on a purple diamond

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,960
to make the top curve I duplicate the

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,100
large Arc

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,840
I will reposition the start and end

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,259
points

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,680
I see I must rotate the arc somewhat

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
so I press the space bar

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,640
I will have to rotate a bit more but

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,739
this time I will reposition the rotation

41
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,040
point

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,860
I'll save my paths so I can adjust them

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,860
later if needed so I duplicate them I

44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,720
hide the original shapes that have the

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
live path effects then I will turn the

46
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,040
duplicates into regular paths and unite

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,280
them

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,060
now let's color the path

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,519
I go to fill and stroke and select

50
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,959
radial gradient

51
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,239
I select the gradient tool and move the

52
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,099
gradient to the bottom left

53
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,200
I click on the dropper tool and Sample

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,780
the green and for the outside color I

55
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,200
sample the blue I shift Ctrl drag to

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,720
make the gradient bigger now let's place

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,519
the text

58
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,440
I will use assistant which is a free

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
Google font

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,099
I click on spacing and set spacing

61
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,440
between letter to 15.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,239
I want to remove the horizontal stroke

63
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,500
from the letter A

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,260
to do this I go to path object to path

65
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,200
I select the node tool and drag over the

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,519
horizontal stroke

67
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,300
I press delete
