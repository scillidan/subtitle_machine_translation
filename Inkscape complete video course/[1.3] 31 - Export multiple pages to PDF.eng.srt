00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,520
in the last lecture we created a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,920
multi-page document now I will save the

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,600
pages as a PDF

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,120
I go to file save as

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,820
behind save as type I choose portable

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,219
document format I will choose the

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,839
highest pdf version

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,119
if you want your text to stay text so it

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,220
can be selected and copied choose embed

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,279
fonts otherwise choose convert text to

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,279
paths if you used blur for example for

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,320
making a shadow or you applied a filter

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
you will have to rasterize these effects

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,300
if you want them displayed in your PDF

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,280
because I save for print I will set

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,239
rasterize filter effects to 300 DPI it

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,579
is also possible to save a PDF with

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,440
extra space around each page called

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,379
bleed as indicated in the menu you can

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,480
set page bleed with the page tool which

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,520
can be found below margins

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,800
keep in mind that for creating PDF files

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,020
with multiple Pages you can also use a

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,879
dedicated desktop publishing software

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,199
like Scripps

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,180
I have a complete course about scribus

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,260
on this channel

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,719
I created spreads in inkscape so I also

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,820
would like to view spreads in acrobat

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
to do this I can click on the show two

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
pages side by side icon

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,260
or I can go to view page display to page

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,840
view

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,920
