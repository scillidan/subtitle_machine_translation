1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,639
we have seen that filters and effects

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,279
must be rasterized to be visible in a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,200
PDF also when importing an SVG and

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,840
scribus you will not see the blur effect

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,840
you'll see the original Vector shape but

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,599
effects like blur are emitted so artwork

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,800
often must be rasterized to be visible

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,600
in other programs the two most used bit

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,359
map formats are PNG and jpeg jpeg

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,320
doesn't support transparency so

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,279
transparent areas will be filled in with

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,679
white also jpeg uses a lossy compression

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
algorithm sacrificing image quality so

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,239
PNG is higher quality and the best

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,800
choice for everything except photographs

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,640
let's see how to save this logo as a bit

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,239
map I will save one for the internet and

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,920
one for print what we will see is that

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,320
you always save in pixels I go to file

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
export I see I can save the entire page

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
when I click on document I see the area

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,079
that will be exported comprises the

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,760
visible elements I only want to export

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,760
the logo so I drag over the logo then I

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,320
go to selection now I see the export

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,080
area is confined to the selection the

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,240
logo for the website has to be 200

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,200
pixels high so for height I give in 200

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
when I press enter I see the width is

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
automatically set to 175 pixels DPI is

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,280
unrelated to pixel dimensions changing

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,840
the DPI will also change the amount of

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,439
pixels so I leave DPI as it is I click

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,000
on export selected only I click on

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,680
select export format and choose PNG at

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,119
the right are different options I prefer

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,079
compression on nine to get the smallest

38
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,240
file size and anti-alias should be on

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
two anti-alias on zero gives ragged

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,600
edges click on the folder icon to choose

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
a location to save then click on export

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,560
when I open the PNG and gim I see the

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,920
size is 175 x 200 pixels now let's save

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,719
the logo for print for print you also

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,600
save in pixels this is because 300

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,038
pixels is the same as 1 in let's say my

47
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,239
logo has to be 2 1/2 in high so 2 1/2 *

48
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,920
300 pix is 750 pixels so for height I

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
give in

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,879
750 when I press tab width is

51
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,080
automatically calculated to 657 pixels I

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
see the DPI value has also changed again

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
in this situation the DPI value is

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
unrelated to the pixel dimensions the

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
only time you use the DPI value field is

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
on the page tab this is because a page

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,879
has a concrete Dimension like A4 to

58
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,879
export a page for print you set it to

59
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,959
300

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,680
DPI changing the DPI change the pixel

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,360
dimensions now we can see that an A4 is

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,480
2,480 x 358 pixels for print
