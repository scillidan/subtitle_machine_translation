1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,940
now let's have a look at the pen tool as

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,040
an illustrator with the pen tool you can

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,319
create curved paths I outlined the

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,360
letter d and made a screenshot of its

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,580
nodes and handles I will recreate the

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,099
letter d with the pen tool as we can see

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,560
the nodes of the large curves are placed

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
at the outer edges of the curve and

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,400
their handles are perfectly horizontal

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,480
or vertical

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,580
to place the first point I click and

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,960
hold down the mouse

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,660
I now see a handle or arm that I can

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,680
move around

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,960
when I press Ctrl I can place the arm

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
perfectly vertical

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,380
I will place the arm at the same height

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,840
as in the example now I let go of the

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
mouse in control

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,020
then I click on the second point which

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,300
is the highest point of the curve I hold

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,700
down the mouse down again and press Ctrl

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,680
now I drag the handle perfectly

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,140
horizontal I will make the length of the

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,059
left arm fit the left example

26
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,340
the right arm needs to be shorter but I

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,680
will do that at a later point I click on

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,140
the third point and drag I don't have to

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,120
press Ctrl because the arm doesn't have

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,399
to be horizontal I will match the left

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,600
arm

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,180
now I will go up because I also have a

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,280
right arm I have a curve and not a

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,740
straight line to get a straight line I

35
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,780
need to remove the right arm to remove

36
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,080
the right arm I press shift plus l i see

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,180
I now have a straight line because I

38
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,979
need the line to go up vertically I

39
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,619
press Ctrl I click on the point above

40
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,020
and still hold down control to also get

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,479
a vertical arm I click on the next Point

42
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,759
hold Ctrl and drag to match the right

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,700
arm I have a sharp corner again so I

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,140
press shift plus l

45
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,900
now we have a new situation I can't drag

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,640
on the Note above because that would

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,579
give me a curve below so I hold Ctrl and

48
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,740
click on the next point now I press

49
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,380
enter to continue I click on the last

50
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,140
point and hold down the mouse I drag out

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,280
a single arm

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,860
I click on the next Point drag and match

53
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,060
the left arm

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,399
to get a sharp corner I press shift L

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,180
again

56
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,399
I hold Ctrl click on the next Point

57
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,860
still hold Ctrl and drag out a vertical

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,820
arm

59
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,159
I click press enter and drag out the

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,119
left arm

61
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,580
I press shift L and click

62
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,038
I hold Ctrl and click on the point below

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,099
at the corner I only need a left arm

64
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,140
so I press enter and then drag the left

65
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,040
arm

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,099
I click and drag and press shift l i

67
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,200
hold Ctrl and click on the point above

68
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,599
then I click on the next point which

69
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,340
also gives a straight line

70
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,280
I press enter and drag an arm out then I

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,500
click and hold Ctrl and match the left

72
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,400
arm

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,260
this is the second point where I will

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,599
adjust the right arm later to finish the

75
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,340
path I click on the first Point again

76
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,280
hold Ctrl and match the bottom arm

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
now I click on the Node tool I will

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
adjust the two right arms that are too

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
long I click on the note on top and hold

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,060
my mouse above the right arm I hold Ctrl

81
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,700
and drag the arm to match I do the same

82
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,220

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,780

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,599
now I draw the Inner Path I click on the

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,620
pen tool I click hold Ctrl and drag then

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,980
I click hold Ctrl and drag again as

88
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,900
before I will adjust the right arm later

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,560
I click and drag to get a corner I press

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,940

96
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,440
arms I click on the note on top and hold

97
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,239

on it hold Ctrl and drag the right arm

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,340
in the Inner Path is now finished now I

102
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,799
have to make the paths a compound path I

103
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,480
select them both and go to path

104
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,879
difference I will make the trace Letter

105
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,519
Black in the next lecture we will have a

106
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,659
closer look at the node tool
