1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,700
in this lecture we will make the

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Microsoft Loop logo I go to file import

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,120
I select the logo and click on open

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
I click on OK I will create a new layer

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,340
and lock the layer with the image I

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,619
click on the ellipse tool I hold down

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,440
control and drag a circle I click on the

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,140
fill and stroke tab I drag the alpha of

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,019
the fill to zero I press the plus once

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,320
to set it to one percent I do this so I

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,359
see only the stroke but I can still drag

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,159
the shapes easily around by dragging

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,059
their fill

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,640
I hold shift plus control and size the

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,420
circle

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,000
I duplicate the circle by pressing Ctrl

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,719
d

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,879
I hold shift and click on the larger

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,820
Circle I go to path difference

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,040
I name the path Circle

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,200
now I click on the rectangle tool and

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,940
drag a rectangle

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,800
I activate snapping

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,960
I press the space bar to go to the

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
select tool I drag the rectangle against

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,120
the Inner Circle until I see corner to

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,440
smooth node

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
I drag the handle down until it snaps

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,320
and I drag to the left until it snaps

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,960
I duplicate the rectangle I click on the

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,060
rectangle again so I see the rotation

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,200
handles

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
I hold Ctrl and drag a corner until I

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,460
rotate it 90 degrees

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,680
I drag the rectangle to the corner until

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,880
it snaps

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,400
I click on the Node tool and select add

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,540
corners

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
I drag the circle at the bottom right

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,100
until I see handle to Corner

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,860
I press the space bar I call the shape

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,619
gradient left and I call the rectangle

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,619
below gradient bottom now I duplicate

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,020
the Layer Two Times by pressing Ctrl D

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,780
to recreate the gradient of the logo I

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
will need to make three gradients I will

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,000
call the top layer gradient left and the

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,820
layer below I call gradient bottom the

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,259
bottom layer will have a general

50
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,899
gradient the left gradient goes from

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,119
dark purple to a lighter purple

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
to create the shape for this I don't

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,720
need the bottom rectangle so I will

54
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,680
delete it

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
I hide the other layers so I can better

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
see what I am doing I will also hide

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,580
gradient left for a moment I click on

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,979
the circle and select the node tool I

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,540
only need the top left part of the

60
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,319
circle

61
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,239
so I will cut the circle

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,120
I drag over the top nodes to select them

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,580
then I click on break path at selected

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
nodes I also do this for the nodes at

65
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,080
the left then I click on the most write

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
node I hold Ctrl and scroll forward

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,300
until all nodes are selected I also

68
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,340
control scroll on the right node of the

69
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,500
Inner Circle I have now selected all

70
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,360
nodes that I don't need so I press

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,300
delete now I want to close the gaps I

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,580
drag over the right nodes I click on

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,500
join selected endnodes with a new

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,780
segment I also do this for the bottom

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,560
nodes

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,080
I make gradient left visible again and

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,620
shift click on it I go to path Union I

78
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,840
call the shape gradient left

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,580
now let's create the shape for the

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,280
bottom gradient I hide gradient left and

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,319
make gradient bottom visible for the

82
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,000
bottom gradient I don't need gradient

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,819
left so I delete it I hide gradient

84
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,099
bottom for the bottom gradient I need

85
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,440
the bottom right of the circle so I

86
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,720
repeat what I did before I select the

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,700
nodes at the right and break the path at

88
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,860
the selected nodes then I select the

89
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,659
nodes at the bottom and break the path

90
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,500
there

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,599
I click on the most left node and

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,640
control scroll forward until all nodes

93
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,519
are selected I also control scroll on

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,739
the left note of the Inner Path then I

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,620
press delete I select the top nodes and

96
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,780
join them and I select the left nodes

97
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,360
and connect them I make gradient bottom

98
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,300
visible again and shift-click on it then

99
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,060
I go to path Union I call the shape

100
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,640
gradient Bottom now I will use the shape

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,220
Builder tool to create the logo shape

102
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,319
I hide gradient bottom and make the

103
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,720
layer below visible I select all three

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,900
shapes I click on the shape Builder tool

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,299
I see I have an unwanted connection so I

106
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,060
click on the X icon to exit I go to path

107
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,700
fracture I click on the shape Builder

108
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,099
tool again I will now combine the shapes

109
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,060
I want

110
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,640
I remove superfluent nodes

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
I call the shape General shape now let's

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
place the gradients I will make the logo

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,858
layer visible to see the colors I will

114
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,079
drag the image to the left I click on

115
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,720
the fill and stroke tab for my fill I

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,940
need a linear gradient I click on the

117
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,199
gradient tool

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,540
then I click on the dropper tool because

119
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,699
the left gradient will be on top I need

120
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,040
the general gradient to go from Blue to

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,419
the lighter purple

122
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,639
so I click on the left color stop and

123
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,740
Sample the blue then I click on the

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
right color stop and Sample the light

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880
purple now I will position the color

126
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,639
stops I drag the left color stop down

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
and the right color stop up

128
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,460
I click on stroke and click on no paint

129
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,040
I go back to my layers now let's color

130
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,660
gradient left

131
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,419
I go to fill and stroke again I click on

132
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,940
fill and click on linear gradient I

133
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,979
click on the left color stop and Sample

134
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,139
the dark purple then I select the right

135
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,840
color stop and Sample the light purple

136
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,440
then I position the color stops

137
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,720
I click on stroke and click on no paint

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,419
I go back to my layers the third

139
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,520
gradient is to improve the gradient on

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
the bottom I go to fill and stroke and

141
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,600
set fill to gradient

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
I click on the left color stop and

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
Sample the blue and for the right color

144
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,680
stop I also sample the blue but I set

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,419
its Alpha to zero

146
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,820
I position the color stops

147
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
and finally I will place the shadow I go

148
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,220
to my layers I duplicate gradient left

149
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,919
that will become the shadow in fill and

150
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,500
stroke I select flat color

151
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,979
I drag Alpha to 100 and I set blur to

152
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,360
about 30 percent

153
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,020
in my layers I call the shape shadow

154
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,240
I will use General shape to mask the

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
shadow

156
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,720
I right click on it and choose set clip

157
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,120
group I drag the clip group in the

158
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,340
gradient left layer I place the clip

159
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,680
group on the bottom I open the clip

160
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,139
group I will now drag the shadow in the

161
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,100
clip group

162
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,320
to remove the shadow at the top I click

163
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,780
on the Node tool I click on the top node

164
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,580
and press delete

165
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,220
I will also delete the node below and to

166
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,259
make gradient bottom visible again I

167
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,940
drag it below the shadow

168
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,220
I will delete the other layers all

169
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,440
shapes of the vectorized logo are now in

170
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
a single layer
