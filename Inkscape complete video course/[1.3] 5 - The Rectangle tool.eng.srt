1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,159
let's have a look at the rectangle tool

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,220
I select it now I drag over the body of

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,980
the crocodile as with the ellipse tool I

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,260
can drag the two squares and when I drag

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,480
the circle all four corners get rounded

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,179
I want however only to round two corners

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,460
I click on the make Corner sharp again

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,699
icon to round individual Corners I click

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,160
on the Node tool I click on ADD Corners

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,080
now I can adjust Each corner

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,599
individually to create a curve at the

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,400
bottom left corner I drag the small

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,660
circle up

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,000
I get two arrows showing the start and

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,460
end points of the curve I drag the arrow

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,739
all the way up and around the bottom

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,719
right corner I drag the circle to the

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,120
left I don't want to border so I shift

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
click on the Red Cross

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,020
in the layers panel I can see I placed a

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,719
rectangle I will name the rectangle body

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,239
because the rectangle was created last

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,420
it lies above the other elements so I

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,520
want to lower the body when I click on

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,379
the down arrow I am lowering the body

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,899
but when there are many objects it is

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,660
faster to drag it to another place

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,459
notice I could even add it to a group

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,619
when I drag and hold it above a group

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,960
the group opens and I can place it where

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,080
I want I will press Ctrl set to undo and

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,240
close the group with the select tool

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,100
selected you can click on the raise and

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,260
lower icons which do the same as the up

35
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,540
and down arrows and with the raise to

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,939
top and lower to bottom icons you can

37
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,979
quickly place an item to the top or the

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,299
bottom of a layer

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,820
now let's make the feet I click on the

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,180
rectangle tool and drag over a foot to

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,159
quickly go to the select tool press the

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,560
space bar now I can adjust from every

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,780
corner and to return to the rectangle

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,439
tool press the space bar again

45
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,840
I drag the circle to round the corners I

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,340
see the top corners are a bit different

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,100
so I click on the Node tool I click on

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,860
ADD Corners to adjust the curve I drag

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,439
the left Circle up and at the right I

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,540
drag the smaller Circle down

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,759
I press the space bar to go to the

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,140
select tool

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,600
now I duplicate the foot and drag it to

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,579
the other foot I click on the brown

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,500
Swatch that I pinned in the swatches

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,139
panel to place the foot behind the other

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,080
foot I click on the lower icon

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,180
I shift-click on the other foot right

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,120
click and choose group then I click on

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,580
the lower to bottom icon in the layers

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,400
panel I will call the group left feet

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,560
I right click on the group and choose

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,980
duplicate I click on Lower to bottom in

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,200
the layers panel I call the group right

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,260
feet I drag the feet and when I hold

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,420
Ctrl while dragging I can drag in a

67
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,819
straight line I can do this horizontally

68
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,379
and vertically

69
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,480
in the next lecture we will create the

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
scutes using the pencil tool
