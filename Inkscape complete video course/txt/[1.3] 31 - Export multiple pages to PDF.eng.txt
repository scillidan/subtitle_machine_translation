In the last lecture, we created a multi-page document. Now I will save the pages as a PDF.
I go to: File > Save As. Behind Save as type I choose: Portable Document Format. I will choose
the highest PDF version. If you want your text to stay text, so it can be selected and copied,
choose: Embed fonts. Otherwise, choose: Convert text to paths. If you used Blur, for example
for making a shadow, or you applied a filter, you will have to rasterize these effects, if you want
them displayed in your PDF. Because I save for print, I will set Rasterize filter effects to:
300 DPI. It is also possible, to save a PDF with extra space around each page, called Bleed. As
indicated in the menu, you can set page Bleed with the Page tool, which can be found below Margins.
Keep in mind that for creating PDF files with multiple pages, you can also use a dedicated
desktop publishing software, like Scribus. I have a complete course about Scribus on this channel. I
created spreads in Inkscape, so I also would like to view spreads in Acrobat. To do this I can click
on the Show two pages side-by-side icon. Or I can go to: View > Page Display > Two Page View.
