In this lecture, I will add some text to the logo. I want the text to stay editable, and also
the curvature of the text to stay editable. Before, we used Path Effects to curve text.
For Path Effects however, you need to convert the text to a path. I could also clone the text,
and work with a clone. That still wouldnt give me the control I want. To rotate text,
I need my text to be on a circle. I select the text tool, and click on the canvas. For Text
alignment, I choose: centered. I use Grand Hotel, which is a free Google font. I type: Coffee
Boutique. I make the size 90 point. I select the Dropper tool, and sample the darker brown.
Now lets place the text on a path. I select the Ellipse tool. I hold Ctrl, and drag a circle.
I go to: Path > Object to Path. In Fill and Stroke, I set Alpha to 1 percent. I Shift-click
on the text. I go to: Text > Put on Path. If I click on the circle again, I can rotate the text.
The text is now on top of the circle. I want to place the text on the bottom, so I want to
place the text on the inside of the circle. To do this I click on the Flip Horizontal icon. Now I
rotate the circle. If I click on the Node tool, I see the text is on the inside of the circle.
I press the spacebar. By dragging at the top, I can determine the curvature of the text.
If I drag the circle, the text will move with it.
But when I move the text, the circle will stay in place.
I can now curve the text, without the circle being over the logo.
And I can still adjust the text.
