Lets look at how to make this logo. A convenient way to do this, is to use the Power stroke.
It wasnt until Illustrator CS6, that you were able to create a variable stroke width.
Its a powerful tool to have in your arsenal. So
lets have a look. I select the Ellipse tool, and drag a circle.
I will make the start and end points fit the large arc.
I go to: Path Effects, and choose: Power stroke. I want the Start and End cap to be rounded.
I drag the purple control point, to adjust the width.
I lower the Opacity, so I can clearly see both shapes.
I zoom in on the start point.
I fine tune the end point.
At this moment, I have three points to adjust the line width. But you can remove and add points.
To add a control point, I Control-click on a purple diamond.
Now I have four points to control the line with.
I will create a fifth control point, by Control-clicking on a purple diamond.
To make the top curve, I duplicate the large arc. I will reposition the start and end points.
I see I must rotate the arc somewhat. So I press the spacebar.
I will have to rotate a bit more. But this time, I will reposition the rotation point.
Ill save my paths, so I can adjust them later if needed. So I duplicate them.
I hide the original shapes, that have the Live Path Effects. Then
I will turn the duplicates into regular paths, and unite them.
Now lets color the path.
I go to Fill and Stroke, and select: Radial gradient.
I select the Gradient tool, and move the gradient to the bottom left. I click on the Dropper tool,
and sample the green. And for the outside color, I sample the blue. I Shift-Ctrl-drag, to make
the gradient bigger. Now lets place the text. I will use Assistant, which is a free Google font.
I click on Spacing, and set Spacing between letters to: 15. I want to remove
the horizontal stroke from the letter A. To do this, I go to: Path > Object to Path.
I select the Node tool, and drag over the horizontal stroke. I press: Delete.
