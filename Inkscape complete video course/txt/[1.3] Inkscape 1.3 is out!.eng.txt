and  it  fills  me  up

starts  to  shine  and  I  see  it  burn  when

you  bring  me  sunlight  is  it  all  you  need

to  feel  this  heat  to  feel  like

everythings  all  that  you  dreamed  is  it

all  too  much  did  you  get  it  enough  does

it  set  on  fire  all  the  things

they  touch  and  it  fills  me  up  and  it

starts  to  shine  and  I  see  it  but  when

you  bring  me



thank  you





and  it  fills  me  up  and  it  starts  to

shine  and  I  sit  burn  when  you  bring  me

and









is  it  all  too  much
