1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,399
in this lecture to get the bars and text

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,780
aligned we will look at different

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,240
alignment methods I will hide the legs

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,059
and show the sketch I create a new layer

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,940
and call it upper body I zoom in on the

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,240
first bar I select the rectangle tool I

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,220
drag over the first bar to match the

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,520
width I press the space bar a technique

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,740
to align and duplicate at the same time

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,560
is found in the snapping menu I activate

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,439
snapping I open the menu and Below

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,380
alignment I activate same distances at

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,239
the bottom I click on reset to simple

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,940
snapping if I want to go back I click on

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,700
advanced mode we see there are now only

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,160
three snapping options I can snap to

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,140
bounding boxes which is the dotted line

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,480
we see around the rectangle and I can

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,460
snap to nodes which I will deactivate

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,219
together with bounding boxes what I want

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,100
is to align so I will activate it if I

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,199
drag the rectangle wherever I press the

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
space bar I will create a copy of it

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,300
I want this rectangle to stay here so I

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,059
press Ctrl D when I drag to the right I

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,500
see the duplicate will align to the

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
original so I don't have to press Ctrl

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,060
when I reach the second graph I press

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,820
the space bar I drag further to the

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,520
third graph inkscape is now recognizing

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,920
a pattern we see an alignment line in

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,600
the middle and a distribute line at the

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,560
bottom

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,479
so two things are happening at the same

35
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,360
time aligning and distributing all I do

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,000
is drag and press the space bar when the

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,400
distribute sign appears the rectangles

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,040
have now equal distances between them

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,080
but because I am using the drawing my

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
bars do not align perfectly with the

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,520
sketch so I will reposition the last bar

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,939
and press Ctrl a to select all bars I

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,340
open the Align and distribute panel to

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,259
redistribute the bars I click below

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,200
distribute uneven horizontal gaps now

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
the bars are perfectly aligned to the

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
sketch I will drag them out I don't need

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,740
the rectangles to be a live shape so I

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,939
will remove their own shape control

50
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,780
widgets I will position the bars

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,140
I press Ctrl a to select all bars I

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,020
right click and choose set clip group

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,360
I select blue and bicycle kick and

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,619
duplicate them

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,480
I drag the duplicates on the clip group

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
folder I will hide the sketch and show

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
the legs

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,020
I also need darker bars at the bottom so

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,420
I duplicate the clip folder I call the

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,300
group dark bars I drag the group on the

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,879
layer so they get on top I select the

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,099
rectangles and make them black

63
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,680
I select the group folder I set the

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
opacity of the folder to 60 percent I

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,900
show sketch to be able to select the

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
dark bars in the canvas I double click

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,580
on a bar now I'm inside the dark bars

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,280
group I click on a bar and drag it down

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,819
I will also do this for the other bars

70
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,800
I hide the sketch again

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
now I will place the text I create a new

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,019
layer and call it text I click on the

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,840
text tool when I click I see a blinking

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,540
cursor for my font I choose pathway

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,660
Gothic 1 which is a free Google font I

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,220
will set text alignment to Center

77
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,420
aligned I type 81 I click on white to

78
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
make the text white I can size the text

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,760
by using the menu I can also size text

80
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,459
with the select tool I hold shift plus

81
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,220
control and drag I want the percent sign

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,980
to be smaller so I select it and make it

83
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,800
18 point I click on spacing and inside

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
vertical kerning with my up and down

85
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,900
arrows I can position the glyph you can

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,599
also do this on the canvas if I hold alt

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
I can move the glyph up and down in

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,040
small steps and I can turn the glyph so

89
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,140
move it closer a further away from the

90
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,299
number by holding alt and pressing the

91
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,459
left and right keys I want to repeat

92
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,159
this text on the other bars and I want

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,959
them to have the same distance to the

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,780
top of a bar to do this I will use a

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,000
placeholder I click on the rectangle

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,480
tool and enable snapping I activate node

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,239
snapping I drag a rectangle and make it

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:00,959
Orange

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,900
I place the rectangle below the text I

100
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,640
shift-click on the text

101
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,620
in align and distribute I choose

102
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,720
relative to biggest object and click on

103
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,420
Center on vertical axis now I will group

104
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,939
them then I duplicate the group

105
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,220
for snapping I only want the corners to

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,918
snap so I click on advanced mode and

107
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,260
deselect bounding boxes and other points

108
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,780
I only want cusp nodes which means

109
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,080
Corner nodes to snap now I drag and will

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
not let go of the mouse until all copies

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
are placed I drag to the top of the next

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,759
bar where it will snap as said I will

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,740
not let go of the mouse but press the

114
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,960
space bar to place a copy

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,860
I repeat this to create the other copies

116
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,080
now I click on the text tool and given

117
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,340
placeholders

124
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,900
I don't need the text to be in a group

125
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,960
anymore so I select them all right click

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,180
and choose ungroup

127
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,240
finally let's place the team names I
