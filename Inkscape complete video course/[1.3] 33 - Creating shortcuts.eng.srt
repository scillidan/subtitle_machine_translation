1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,800
in lecture 12 I assigned the shortcut

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
control y to toggle between normal and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,000
outline mode as it is an

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,480
illustrator in inkscape this function

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,120
doesn't have a shortcut by default I

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,839
also want inkscape and scribus to

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,600
have the same shortcuts for the same

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,320
tools to change shortcuts I go to edit

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,800
preferences I open interface and click

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
on keyboard if you would like to have

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,039
the shortcuts from another software

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,359
program behind keyboard file there is a

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,119
list with options

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,559
I would like the illustrator shortcuts

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,800
toggling between normal and outline mode

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,719
by default doesn't have a shortcut set

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,600
so I will add it in the search window I

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
type toggle I see that display mode

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,440
toggle doesn't have a shortcut yet to

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,239
add it I click at the right in the

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
shortcut column I now see the text new

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,879
accelerator I type control y if the

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,920
shortcut is already used you can choose

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,600
to reuse it for another function so I

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,519
click on yes and I close the

26
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,519
window
