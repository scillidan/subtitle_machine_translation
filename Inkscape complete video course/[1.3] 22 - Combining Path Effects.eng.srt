1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,840
in inkscape you can combine pathfx I

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,759
select the text tool and type some text

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,580
I will use luckiest guy which is a free

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,719
Google font I go to pathfx I see that I

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,580
need to convert the text to a path to

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,020
use a path effect

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,960
new in inkscape 1.3 beta is that you can

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,060
do this now with a single click

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,640
so I click on convert text to paths

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,680
from the menu I choose perspective

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,699
envelope

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,500
we will look at perspective in the next

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,859
lecture I select envelope deformation I

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,140
click on the Node tool I can now drag

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,719
the Four Corners to deform the shape

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,880
what I want is the end of the text to be

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,840
smaller

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,180
so I hold Ctrl and drag the nodes at the

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,020
right end

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,600
now I will add a second effect from the

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
menu I choose band

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,820
I select edit on canvas I can now curve

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,100
the text I can switch between the two

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,800
filters to get the result I want I can

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
even change the order of the filters

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,100
which will change the look of the shape

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,260
when I'm happy with the shape I'll

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,480
finalize it by going to path object to

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,540
path I will make the text a bit higher I

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,240
call the path text now I go to path

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,740
linked offset

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,380
I select the node tool I set the fill

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,560
color to Red I drag the note up I go to

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,860
path object to path I call the path red

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,680
I go to extensions generate from path

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,520
long Shadow I set length to 5. I select

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,500
the long Shadow elements and make them a

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,119
single path with Union

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,580
I call the path long shadow

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,159
I remove the group folders

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,479
in fill and stroke I make the red darker

42
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,600
and inside my text I want a gradient I

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,640
choose linear gradient and I select the

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,860
gradient tool

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,020
I make the gradient vertical

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,420
I set the gradient to yellow and I make

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,119
the top color more orange

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,180
I convert text to a clip group

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,759
now I'll create a diamond pattern I

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,340
select the rectangle tool I hold Ctrl

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,040
and drag a small square I go to path

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,740
object to path I click on the Square

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,700
again hold Ctrl and rotate 45 degrees I

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,580
go to pathfx from the menu I choose

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,760
tiling I set rows to 50 and columns to

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,580
150 and I increase the gap between the

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,480
squares I set offset to 50 I will leave

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,180
the tiling path effect editable I call

59
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,420
the path pattern I set the opacity to 15

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,540
and the blend mode to multiply I drag

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,239
the pattern on the clip group I make the

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,860
pattern smaller

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860
I duplicate text and drag it on top

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
I shift-click on white and click on the

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,540
Red Cross to delete the fill I make the

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,180
stroke smaller I call the path stroke

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,180
white I duplicate stroke white I call

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,060
the original stroke Shadow I shift click

69
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,000
on black in fill and stroke I set blur

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,660
to 10 percent and opacity to 75 percent

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,060
I hold alt and position The Shadow

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,760
I duplicate red I make the original Pink

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,220
I call the path pink

74
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,980
I position red on the canvas I select

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,680
the rectangle tool I drag a rectangle

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,540
and drag it on the clip group

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,480
I call the path Horizon now I will

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,580
duplicate long Shadow to make the shadow

79
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,540
below I call the copy Shadow below I

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,340
place Shadow Below on the bottom and

81
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,599
click on black

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,819
and in fill and stroke I increase the

83
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,120
blur
