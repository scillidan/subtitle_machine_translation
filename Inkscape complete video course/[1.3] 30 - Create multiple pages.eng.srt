00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,280
if you are working on different logo

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,019
ideas and you're running out of space

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,660
you can make the page bigger to do this

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,540
click on the pages tool now I can simply

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,400
drag out a corner to make the artboard

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,099
larger you can also create a multi-page

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,160
file which you can then export as a PDF

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,279
I have my page set to A4 to change the

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,859
page size I right click to open document

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,859
properties if I click behind format I

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,180
can choose from a list of standard

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,720
formats I can also give it a size I

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,579
prefer to work in millimeter but I can

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,480
choose another measurement

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,059
I select the pages tool

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,579
I want to create two spreads I click on

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,200
the new page icon

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,540
to connect the pages I drag a page until

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,800
it snaps

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
I open document properties again I

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,260
deselect show Shadow I create a new page

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,800
in snapping I enable alignment

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,440
I drag the new page below the spread and

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
I add a fourth page

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
I'll place it against the page below

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
I will also Place some margins

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,220
I type 15 millimeters

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,880
I give all four pages a margin

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,220
you can also drag margins

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,580
or you can set a specific value

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,320
I can scroll with my scroll wheel

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,400
the margins are magnetic

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,380
in the next lecture we will export a

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,400
multi-page PDF
