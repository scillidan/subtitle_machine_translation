1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,040
in this and the next lecture I will

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,319
integrate a graph with an image to start

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,120
let's import the sketch I have for the

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,179
end result I go to file import and open

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,059
the sketch I hold shift plus control and

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,400
make the sketch a bit smaller I call the

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,340
image sketch and lock it I set the

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,980
opacity to 25 and the blend mode to

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,859
multiply I create a new layer and call

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,680
it legs now I import the image of the

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
soccer player I call the image bicycle

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
kick I will increase the size of the

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
image until it roughly fits the sketch

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,399
outline as we see with the end result I

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,079
need the legs to be cut out

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,579
normally you don't need the high

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,500
Precision like the letter we traced in

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,600
the last lecture the node tool in

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,219
inkscape lets you trace an image

20
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,100
extremely fast and the node tool offers

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
many possibilities to customize the

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
result when needed I will hide the

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,579
sketch before we can utilize the node

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,379
tool I will first place some nodes

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,600
around the legs using the pen tool

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,940
I will place points by roughly following

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,879
the shape of the legs as we see I do not

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,220
make any curves I just place a point

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,619
when there is a change in Direction I

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,080
don't worry about curves the node tool

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,540
is much faster at creating curves with

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,460
the football I only click on the outer

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,040
edges as we saw in the last lecture

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,380
so I only click at the bottom the left

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,119
and the top of the ball

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,619
where there is some more important

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,780
detail I will zoom in a bit and place

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,720
some points what is chopped off by the

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,520
straight lines will be corrected by the

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
node tool

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
so I click there where there are changes

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,860
in the direction of the Curve also for

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,540
the bottom of the shoe I click

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,460
pretending my lines are curved even

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,560
though they are not even the sharp

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,540
points of the soccer shoe studs will be

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,880
taken care of by the node tool when I

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
have reached the shorts again I can

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,320
close the path to do this I click again

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
on the first point

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,399
now I select the node tool I will select

52
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,380
some nodes that I don't need by dragging

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,560
over them then I press delete now I will

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,659
match the curves by simply dragging the

55
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,500
lines

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,600
I wouldn't do this to trace letters but

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
it works extremely fast I have traced

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
many images in and Photoshop in the

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,038
past but the node tool of inkscape is

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,540
probably my favorite tool to trace

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,560
images

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,980
this way of working doesn't give the 100

63
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,599
accuracy that for example is needed when

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,040
you create a logo

65
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,500
but for tracing bitmap images in my

66
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
opinion this isn't needed to get good

67
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,200
results

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,599
as we see I have full control over the

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
curve I drag a line and can get it any

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,700
curvature I want and if I want to add a

71
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,099
point I simply double click on a line

72
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,200
so now let's look at some extra features

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
that the node tool provides I drew the

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,459
spikes of the bottom shoe with a single

75
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,340
note if I find this a bit too pointy I

76
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,440
can easily make them more round

77
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,540
I select the spikes by shift clicking on

78
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,940
them then I click on the make selected

79
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,500
node smooth icon

80
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,780
now let's have a look at the other foot

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,819
I will drag over the top nodes and

82
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,220
smooth them it does give me the result I

83
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,400
need but you can do more as we see with

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,980
a smooth note the arms are linked but

85
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,720
let's say I want to move the arms

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,480
independently to do this click once on

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,819
the make selected nodes Corner icon

88
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,159
we see the node changed from a square to

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
a diamond the arms are not connected

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,400
anymore

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
and if you want to remove the arms click

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,840
on the make selected nodes Corner icon a

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,980
second time

94
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,680
I will make the node smooth again if you

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
want the arms of a node to have the same

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
length at all times click on make

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
selected nodes symmetric if I drag an

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
arm I see the other arm is mirrored in

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,080
the node Auto smooth gives special kind

100
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,420
of arms that adjusts themselves when you

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,739
drag the note

102
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,959
I will go back to a smooth node where

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
the arms are linked but can have their

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,860
own length if you want to create a

105
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
straight line between two curved nodes

106
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,040
select the nodes

107
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,799
then click on straighten lines now the

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,480
path between the nodes is straight and

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,459
the nodes are locked in their Direction

110
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,319
this locking is to prevent the straight

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,940
line to curve when you adjust the

112
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,640
handles and to go back to a curve simply

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,860
drag the line if you want to give an arm

114
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,540
a different direction but you don't want

115
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,459
to change the length of an arm hold the

116
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,659
ALT key

117
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,879
and to add a point simply double-click

118
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,819
on a line as we see there are many ways

119
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,040
to manipulate a curve with a node tool

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
if you don't want to see the arms

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,820
deselect the show bezier handles icon

122
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,639
and to hide the path itself deselect the

123
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,100
show path outline icon I will delete

124
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,840
some nodes

125
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,120
to quickly add nodes without having to

126
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,400
double-click many times select two nodes

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,460
then click on insert new nodes into

128
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,040
selected segments each time you click

129
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,460
the amount of added nodes will double

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,280
now my path is ready let's use the path

131
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,580
to cut out the legs I call the path legs

132
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,639
I right click on the path and choose set

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,100
clip group I drag the image on the clip

134
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,199
group folder I want my image to be

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,320
duotone so I will add a blue rectangle I

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
click on a blue I call the rectangle

137
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
blue I set blue to the color blend mode

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,540
I click on fill and stroke I can now

139
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,940
give the duotone the correct color I

140
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,540
drag the blue a bit more to cyan

141
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,580
in the next lecture we will place the

142
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,300
bars in the text
