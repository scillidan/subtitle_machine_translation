1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
in this lecture we will use inkscape to

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,220
automatically vectorize a bitmap logo

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,379
I will use Bing image Creator to get

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
some ideas for a logo

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,700
Bing image Creator is a free service and

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,040
you can type what kind of logo you want

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,600
I typed logo coffee shop flat design

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,279
minimalistic three colors and on a white

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,600
background

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,699
I created several examples and

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,680
downloaded a logo I liked

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,099
in inkscape I go to file import

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,619
I open the coffee shop logo

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,079
I will crop the logo using the rectangle

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,280
tool

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,860
I drag over the logo press the space bar

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,960
and position the rectangle

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,000
I shift-click on the image

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,239
I right click and choose set clip

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,820
I right click again and choose crop

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,520
image to clip I right click a third time

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,100
and choose Trace bitmap

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,620
in the last lecture we used single scan

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,480
to create a brush

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
now we have a color image so I click on

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,260
the multi-color tab

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,280
for detection mode I choose colors scans

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
means the amount of paths that will be

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
created which is by default on 8.

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
let's see if I can get fewer paths if I

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,180
reduce scans I see that I can bring the

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,100
amount of paths down to six

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,200
I also want inkscape to remove the white

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,580
background

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,320
let's see what happens if I click on

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,159
apply

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,979
when I zoom in I see some speckles

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,500
this means inkscape made a very detailed

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,640
scan

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,259
so let's try again

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,420
when I hold my mouse above Speckles I

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,520
read that by increasing it small spots

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
will be ignored

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,180
so I increase the Speckles value

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,460
I will also select stack which attempts

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,900
to reduce gaps

47
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,960
I click on apply now let's optimize the

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,840
scan in my layers I see I have a group

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,479
of paths I hold alt to look at the

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,500
layers

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,899
I zoom in on the most right element

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,600
we see the path is not smooth

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,780
so I go to path simplify I see that the

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,520
shortcut is Ctrl l

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,320
this already looks better

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,719
let's have a look at the nodes I select

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,979
the node tool

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,959
I think I can reduce the amount of nodes

59
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,500
even more so I press Ctrl l now I can

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
easily adjust the shape when needed I

61
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,599
select the middle element I press Ctrl L

62
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,819
three times when I click on the left

63
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,459
element I see I have a compound path

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,020
I prefer to work with individual

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,020
elements so I go to path split path

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,420
in my layers I see I have now two

67
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,819
separate paths with the same color I

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,319
select the left element

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
I press Ctrl l two times

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,940
then I select the black outline and go

71
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,480
to path split path I select the handle

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
I press Ctrl L several times now I

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
select the cup outline

74
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,840
I see it get an undesired effect in the

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,060
corner when I press Ctrl l

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,580
so I press Ctrl set let's see what

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,200
happens when I delete individual

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,819
Superfluous nodes

79
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,519
I remove some nodes at the right each

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,560
time I remove a node inkscape will

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,780
restore the curve as good as it can

82
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,879
finally let's look at the inside of the

83
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,519
cup I select the green element and press

84
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,440
Ctrl l two times

85
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,940
because I will expand the shape to

86
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,620
remove gaps I will delete all

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,239
Superfluous nodes

88
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,580
now I only have to drag three nodes to

89
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,220
remove any gaps

90
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,620
the shape above is below the green shape

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,200
here I will press Ctrl L several times

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,379
to remove as much nodes as possible to

93
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,480
remove all gaps I increase its size

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,180
holding shift plus control

95
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,760
I have now traced the logo and I

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,500
optimize the paths to a minimum amount

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
of nodes so I can easily adjust the

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,500
shapes if needed
