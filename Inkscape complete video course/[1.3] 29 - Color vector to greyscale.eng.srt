00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,100
let's have a look at converting color to

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,259
grayscale and the challenges you may

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,600
encounter here I have used three very

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,220
different colors that are easily

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,300
distinguished

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,040
let's see how they look like in

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,559
grayscale I go to filters color

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,920
grayscale I click on live preview

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,440
we see in grayscale they now look

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,060
exactly the same

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,039
so how do we solve this problem

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
I will remove the grayscale effect by

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,660
going to filters remove filters

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,720
let's try again I go to filters color

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
grayscale let's say I want blue to be

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,820
the darkest color

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,920
to do this I will decrease the lightness

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,000
of blue

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,820
and I want red to be in between blue and

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,840
green

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,579
I want to further increase the contrast

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,320
between the colors

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,899
I increase lightness and I make blue and

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,460
red darker

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,980
I click on apply and on close

26
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,719
this is what I would expect these colors

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,760
to look like in grayscale

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,800
I need a black and white variant of my

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
logo

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,800
but applying the grayscale filter will

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,780
not actually change the colors

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,000
this is because a filter is like a live

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,700
path effect the path effect changes a

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,860
path but the original path still exists

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,920
and this is also true for a filter the

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960
grayscale filter only changes the

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,520
appearance of the colors

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
the filter will be applied when I export

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,060
a PNG

40
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,680
but if I want to send someone a true

41
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,080
grayscale SVG I will have to change the

42
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,840
actual colors for this video I gave the

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
paths their corresponding color

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
to quickly see what colors you used in

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,439
your document Open document resources

46
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,900
I see I used five colors

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,939
I can not only see what colors I used

48
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,920
but also which fonts

49
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,600
now let's convert the colors to

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,799
grayscale

51
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,259
I will drag fill and stroke to the tabs

52
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,159
below

53
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,079
I click on Steam middle

54
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,960
I drag saturation to zero

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,540
If a color is used in more paths I right

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,960
click and choose select same fill color

57
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,780
then I drag saturation to zero

58
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,460
I do this for all five colors

59
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,780
now let's say I want the cup to be

60
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,699
completely black

61
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,099
to do this I drag lightness to zero
