1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,399
now let's give the crocodile a grain

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,740
shading texture some of the techniques

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,259
uses will be explained more in depth in

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,900
later lectures to shade the body I will

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,000
first combine the body parts I right

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,519
click on the body and choose select same

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,199
fill color

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,840
then I go to path Union

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,960
I call the United path body parts

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,000
I will drag the body parts path out of

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
the feed group above the feet I right

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,859
click on the body parts path and choose

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,800
set clip group I name the clip group

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,739
body shaving you can recognize a clip

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,480
Group by a folder with a scissor sign

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,239
when I open the body shading folder I

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,579
see a folder called clip whatever is in

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,440
this folder will be used as a clipping

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,020
mask I want to reuse the body parts path

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,899
so I press Ctrl d i drag the copy

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,640
outside the clip folder

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
and I duplicate it again

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,340
with the rectangle tool I draw a

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,140
rectangle that is larger than the body

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,379
parts

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,739
I drag body parts above the rectangle

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,720
then I press Ctrl 9 3 times

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,880
what I did is inset the path with three

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,460
steps I hold shift and also select the

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,880
rectangle I go to path difference I call

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,000
the result texture I close an open layer

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,280
too to get more room and open body

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,860
shading again I drag the fill and stroke

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,840
panel all the way to the bottom until I

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,180
see a blue blinking rectangle then I let

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,180
go of the mouse I click on texture at

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,979
the bottom of fill and stroke I increase

38
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,500
blur to about 30. I click on the black

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,860
Swatch I go to filters overlays noise

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,860
fill I click on the noise color Tab and

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,960
set Alpha to zero then I click on

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,900
options I click on live preview for

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,180
turbulence type I choose fractal noise

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,460
with horizontal and vertical frequency

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,259
you can make the grain smaller and

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,979
larger I click on apply at some parts I

47
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,960
want more grain and at some parts less

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,720
to do this I click on the Node tool

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,299
right now there are 32 nodes I can drag

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,940
which I find too many so I go to path

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,239
simplify now I have 18 nodes which is

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
better I also lower the opacity of the

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,940
texture I will set it to 25 percent now

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,500
I will adjust the visibility of the

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,000
grain by dragging the nose
