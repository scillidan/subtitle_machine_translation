1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,680
next we'll take a look at some of the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,720
basics of navigating the user interface

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,359
in order to ensure the canvas is

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,480
centered and visible on the screen click

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,360
on the percentage menu in the overview

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,880
panel and choose fit view should the

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,000
canvas become angled there's a button

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,760
here to reset the rotation as well right

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
click and choose reset using a pen or a

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
mouse you can hover over many of the

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,920
buttons in cre and see a tool tip that

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,439
indicates what each feature is you'll

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,359
notice that once I click on a button or

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,238
menu it is highlighted in blue this is

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,600
how you can tell if a tool brush feature

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,520
or setting is active or not now let's

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,800
try making some marks on the canvas with

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,120
brushes the tool box has all of the

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,200
tools that you'll be using here in Crea

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,360
and each tool can perform a variety of

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,640
functions for example we can select the

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,760
freehand brush tool which tells Crea

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,039
that we are ready to paint if the brush

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,039
tool is not selected we will not be able

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,719
to paint on our canvas next let's make

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,600
sure we have a visible color selected

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
for paint painting it's hard to see what

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
you're doing if you're using white paint

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
on a white canvas so let's choose dark

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
blue for now this way we can easily see

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,640
The Strokes we're making as we paint to

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
choose a color click inside a section of

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,439
the circular artistic color selector to

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
select a hue and

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,240
saturation next choose the brightness

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,680
you want from the strip on the left if

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,159
you prefer a more standard way of

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,880
choosing color you can toggle to the

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,159
wide gamut color selector or choose from

40
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,520
a palette of swatches we're going to go

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,400
more in depth into the color selection

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,520
options later you may have already

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
selected a brush so to make sure we're

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,560
all working with the same brush let's go

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
to the brush presets on the left and

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,320
choose the paint category to filter out

47
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,240
only those brushes I'll choose the basic

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,479
five size opacity brush and if I paint a

49
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,920
test stroke using firm pressure I get a

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,240
fairly simple stroke shape with paint

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
that is flat and opaque if you're using

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
a drawing tablet you can control the

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
thickness opacity and other properties

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
of your brushes by adjus adjusting the

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,920
amount of pressure you apply for example

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
light pressure will create thinner more

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,119
transparent lines while heavier pressure

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
will result in thicker more opaque lines

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
it's worth noting that a mouse doesn't

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
have this capability and can't replicate

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,360
this effect now that we've made a mess

62
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,519
on our canvas let's learn how to quickly

63
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,040
clear everything off of course you can

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
use your eraser but there's a faster way

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
to do it simply press delete to clear

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,800
the contents of the currently selected

67
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
layer now that we are able to paint

68
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,920
paint on our canvas let's go more in

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
depth into the navigation tools we'll

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,440
start with panting the canvas or moving

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,760
the canvas around your workspace you can

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,200
do that in a number of different ways

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,480
the first is to use the overview panel

74
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,840
you may need to expand it vertically

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
when you click and hold with your mouse

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,480
or tap and hold with your pen on the

77
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,879
thumbnail of your canvas you can drag to

78
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,480
reposition it another way to pan is to

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,920
hold down the space bar on a keyboard

80
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,680
that will toggle your cursor to the pan

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
mode allowing you to move moove the

82
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,000
canvas releasing space bar returns you

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,640
to whatever tool was previously selected

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
if you're using a touch capable device

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,599
you can also press down with two fingers

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,200
and drag your canvas to pan it around

87
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,159
try to avoid twisting or rotating your

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,120
fingers because it will rotate your

89
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,680
canvas if that happens and your canvas

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,640
is a skew you can right click in the

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,599
overview panel to return the canvas to

92
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,879
its upright position there are also

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,159
Options under settings configure Crea

94
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,400
canvas input settings to customize touch

95
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,120
Rec ignition if you don't want it to

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,400
affect the rotation of the canvas

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,599
multi-touch can be temporarily disabled

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
using a switch or a button on your

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,720
tablet so if it's not working be sure to

100
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,920
check that next let's take a look at

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,200
zooming in and out of the canvas we can

102
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,640
do that in a number of different ways

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
first I can do it with the menu and

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,000
slider in the overview panel another way

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,040
to do it is to hold Control Plus space

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
bar on your keyboard and click or tap

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
and drag left or right or up and down on

108
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,799
the canvas this will let you focus on on

109
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,400
a Target area this method utilizes

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
scrubby Zoom which lets you zoom in and

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,159
out very fluidly the other modes Zoom to

112
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,599
specific increments another way to zoom

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,239
in increments is to use the keyboard

114
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,239
shortcuts of plus and minus you're not

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,279
limited to navigating with your keyboard

116
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,079
you can also use the express keys on

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
your tablet to invoke these tools and

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,440
commands I'll explain how to use express

119
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,840
Keys later in this lesson we can also

120
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,960
zoom using touch gestures by spreading

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
two fingers apart to zoom in or bringing

122
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
two fingers closer together to zoom out

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,639
there are also options in the overview

124
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,800
panel to fit the image on the screen and

125
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,240
zoom the canvas to 100% 100% means the

126
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,120
canvas is not zoomed in or zoomed out

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,080
and after zooming in you can drag the

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
box over the thumbnail to focus on

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
specific areas of your painting to

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
rotate the canvas you can use the

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,800
overview panel or the shortcuts hold

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,479
shift plus space bar then drag to rotate

133
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,199
the canvas around a central axis

134
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,600
likewise you can also press four or six

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,440
to rotate in increments five will reset

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
the rotation you can also manually set

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,600
the rotation angle from the overview

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,880
panel for example you could rotate the

139
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
canvas

140
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,960
45° you can also use Touch to rotate the

141
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,000
canvas by twisting two fingers you may

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,639
accidentally paint while touching with

143
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,759
one finger so you may want to disable

144
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,520
that in the Creed preferences under

145
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
General

146
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,639
tools once you have mastered these

147
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,800
navigation tools it's quite easy to

148
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,160
manipulate your view of the canvas

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,120
if you have a drawing tablet it may come

150
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,479
with Express Keys these are buttons that

151
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,319
are built into the device and can be

152
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,400
customized to perform keyboard shortcuts

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,080
and execute commands with encr they can

154
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,000
be a useful tool for streamlining your

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,840
workflow and for saving time I'm using

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,680
the centiq 27 QHD touch which comes with

157
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,440
the walkom express key remote if I open

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,319
the walkom tablet properties I can click

159
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,319
on the express key remote or whichever

160
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,560
device that I want to configure it's

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,080
very important that you make a note of

162
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,639
which application that you're assigning

163
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,560
commands to by default all other is

164
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,520
selected which is a global setting for

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,440
all

166
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,560
applications that Global setting can be

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,440
overwritten by adding specific

168
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,759
applications once you choose a specific

169
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,319
application you can have different

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,199
shortcuts for each individual

171
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,680
application to add an application click

172
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,319
on the plus button I'll choose the cre

173
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,960
application so that the functions I

174
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,400
program will apply only to Crea then

175
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,599
I'll click on Crea to activate it I

176
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,120
won't go into detail about how to set

177
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,000
this up but you can experiment to

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
determine which tools and commands you

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
use frequently enough to justify

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
assigning them to an Express key your

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,520
pen may also have buttons that you can

182
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,000
assign shortcuts to these buttons are

183
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,360
usually located near the tip of the pen

184
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
typically Pens have one two or three

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,039
buttons to give you an example you could

186
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,840
program one of these pens to act as the

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,199
Eraser allowing you to erase by holding

188
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,800
down the pen button next I want to

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
discuss some of the panels that are

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,680
floating here in our interface we can

191
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,560
have individual panels floating on our

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,680
screen like this or we can have these

193
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,479
panels grouped together in different

194
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,639
ways panels or Dockers as they referred

195
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,800
to in cre can be collapsed so that they

196
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,080
take up less space on the screen or they

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,759
can be opened when it's time to access

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,479
the contents within you can drag panels

199
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,680
around and reposition them by dragging

200
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,039
from the top bar of the panel if the

201
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,840
panel has an X and you click on it

202
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
you'll close the panel you can restore

203
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,680
panels from settings Dockers I'll

204
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,039
restore the overview panel you can

205
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,520
navigate between the different panels

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
that are grouped together by clicking on

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,800
the tab many panels also have one or

208
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
more options buttons that can customize

209
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,440
the panel contents panels can be docked

210
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,400
together on the sides of the UI but not

211
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
when they are free floating you can even

212
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,919
dock panels on the top and bottom of the

213
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,879
UI to resize panels and reveal more or

214
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,800
less of their contents drag from the

215
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,039
sides or corners of the panel some

216
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,960
panels have content that will scale in

217
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,400
relation to the panel the color selector

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,159
is one such example

219
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,000
as I mentioned earlier panels can even

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
be locked if you're concerned about

221
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,159
accidentally moving the panels while

222
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,720
you're drawing you can unlock the panels

223
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,159
with the same button another way to

224
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,639
navigate is to use the pop-up panel you

225
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
can access this whenever the brush tool

226
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
is selected by right clicking on the

227
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,080
canvas on the outside are controls to

228
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,759
rotate the canvas and zoom there are

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,879
more controls here that we will explore

230
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,080
later I'm using a fairly large display

231
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,759
which allows me to keep a wide view of

232
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,599
my canvas this while still having room

233
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,440
for multiple panels your workflow may

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,880
require even more panels in which case

235
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,640
it can be helpful to hide the interface

236
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,159
so that you only see the canvas you can

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
do this by pressing tab on your keyboard

238
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,720
This removes a lot of the distractions

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
and allows you to focus on your painting

240
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,839
if you want the panels to return press

241
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,440
tab again it's easy enough to press tab

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
on your keyboard but you can also set an

243
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,080
Express key to show and hide the UI if

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,959
you want to squeeze a tiny bit more room

245
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,399
out of C's UI you can enter full screen

246
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,440
mode from The View menu and that will

247
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,160
hide the application bar near the top of

248
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
the screen this can be useful if you're

249
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
concerned about accidentally closing the

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,760
application or moving the window to exit

251
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,440
full screen mode you'll have to click on

252
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,560
it again in the view menu or you can use

253
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
the control shift F keyboard shortcut to

254
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,399
make it easier to invoke those were the

255
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,120
basics of navigating the UI andr in the

256
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,760
next lesson I'll give you an overview of

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
how to select

258
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
brushes
