1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,760
at this point we've looked at a lot of

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,840
brushes between all of the default

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,920
brushes in CR the brushes that I've

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,759
created the brushes other artists have

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,400
created and the brushes that you can

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,480
create there are more brushes available

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,799
than you could ever use in one lifetime

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,000
for a first-time user of Crea the sheer

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,680
number of brushes to choose from can

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,480
feel intimidating through

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,240
experimentation you will discover which

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
brushes are valuable to you but I will

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,199
also offer some suggestions for brushes

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,480
that I find useful I would consider

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,320
these to be my Essential brushes to make

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,119
them quicker to access all of these

17
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,960
brushes are located in a custom bundle

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
before we begin I'll remind you to reset

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,920
any modified brushes to their defaults

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,520
to ensure they match my

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,399
demonstrations I'll use the brush

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,680
testing template to demonstrate let's

23
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,039
start with some airbrushes in the

24
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,039
rendering AR category the first variant

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,559
is called airbrush soft airbrushes are

26
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,600
one of the oldest and most basic brushes

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
one can use to create digital art but

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,879
they are still incredibly useful The

29
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,960
Feathered edges and slowly building

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,000
opacity make your brushes perfect for

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,199
adding form to objects and creating hand

32
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,439
painted gradients I have a lot of

33
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,360
control over the brush opacity using pen

34
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,479
pressure you can also apply blending

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
modes to modify how the brush media

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
blends with underlying paint you can

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
quickly access these from the properties

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,960
bar let's set it to multiply if I

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,920
overlap Strokes I can build up my color

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
darker without having to change anything

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
in the color selector when working with

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
blending modes you may also want to

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,520
blend Strokes with underlying colors

44
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,119
using an appropriate layer blending mode

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll revert the template the grainy

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
airbrush is similar to the previous

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,159
airbrush but with the ability to use

48
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,640
texture you can see that it has a soft

49
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,399
edge with some texture throughout the

50
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,840
stroke I can easily change this from the

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
properties bar glazing airbrush is also

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
similar to the soft air brush but it

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,200
uses wash instead of buildup for the

54
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,360
paint blending mode have a look at the

55
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,640
previous lesson to learn about the

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,159
differences between wash and buildup

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,280
this brush is useful for slowly building

58
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,719
up thin glazes of paint with opacity

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
that is more even and easy to control

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,960
next is the glow airbrush which also has

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,598
airbrush qualities this variant builds

62
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,560
up colors in a way that mimics natural

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,239
light the blending moon is set to screen

64
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,840
but you can also get some nice lighting

65
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,640
effects using the color Dodge Mode I use

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,480
this brush a lot for lighting objects

67
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,519
and

68
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,400
backgrounds next is the pepper air brush

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
this brush sprays out droplets of paint

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,560
that vary in size at only a few pixels

71
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,080
in diameter this brush works well for

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,920
creating Stars snow and sand you may

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
want to use the mouse to make single

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
dabs so you don't build up too many

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,800
features at once the size of the

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
features can be controlled in the brush

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,159
editor under spray shape you will need

78
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,159
to link the width and height to keep the

79
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,840
features round unlinking will allow you

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
to make ellipses and lines the pixel

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,560
airbrush is next this brush sprays out

82
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,440
even finer Speckles you can use this for

83
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,760
a more controlled spray that builds up

84
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,319
slowly moving on to some other brush

85
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,760
types we have the smooth pen this

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
creates an opaque stroke with a smooth

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,959
edge it works well for inking or

88
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,159
blocking in layers you could use this

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
brush to establish the silhouette of an

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,319
object and then use other types of

91
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,040
brushes to add form to it you can edit

92
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,879
the brush tip to tweak the edges of this

93
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,440
brush if you want the edges of your

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
silhouette to be sharper or

95
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,840
softer let's move on to the sketching

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,239
pencil this is a fantastic pencil

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
because you can tilt your pen to change

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,799
the shape and opacity of the dab

99
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,439
allowing you to emulate shading with the

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,040
side of it opacity and texture both

101
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,480
respond nicely to pen pressure as you

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
can see I can create a smooth gradient

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
from dark to light by modulating my

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
pressure this is my go-to brush for

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
sketching and pencil drawing because it

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,159
has a superb look and feel the cylinder

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
pen is an rgba type brush that uses a

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
lightness map to create a 2.5d stroke

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,040
I'll select a dark brown and you can see

110
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
that I'm able to use varied pressure to

111
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,200
paint tree branches that look almost

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,239
three dimension itional this may save

113
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,640
you from having to add shading later

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
with an airbrush you can even use it for

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,640
leaves if you make shorter strokes this

116
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,319
brush could even be useful for creating

117
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,000
textures as you can see if I place

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Strokes right up against each other now

119
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,439
let's check out the chalk which I find

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,120
useful for adding texture to objects you

121
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
can get a lot of different looks from

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,560
many of my brushes by changing your

123
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,120
texture for a texture that is even more

124
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,919
random there is random chalk this brush

125
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,800
has a bit more randomization to make the

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
texture less repetive itive you can see

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,360
the difference if I compare two strokes

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,919
both of these brushes can benefit from

129
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,199
setting the paint blending to screen or

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
multiply as you can see I can use a

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
single color to create the base color of

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,120
foliage as well as the highlights and

133
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,720
shadows chalk is just a name for these

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,039
brushes I use them more for their shape

135
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,960
than their

136
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
medium next is sponge this brush has a

137
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,160
spongy dab with a lot of detail you can

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
dab with this brush or overlap Strokes

139
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
to create a more intricate texture

140
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,039
texture if we make our brush bigger the

141
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,199
texture gets larger if we make the brush

142
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,639
smaller the texture gets finer you can

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,280
also modify the texture pattern this

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
brush works well to add a quick texture

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,160
overlay on a separate

146
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,039
layer variable shape uses a mast brush

147
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,840
tip to blend between two different dab

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,520
shapes making the brush larger increases

149
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
the size of the shapes heavy pressure

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
makes distinct shapes that are more

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,600
opaque and light pressure makes soft

152
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,039
shapes that are more transparent I find

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,840
this brush to be incredibly useful for

154
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
painting foliage because it generates a

155
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,440
wide variety of leaf patterns and by

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,319
modifying the texture pattern I can

157
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,080
randomize the leaf shapes even

158
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
more next I'll load the blenders

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
template and let's take a look at some

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
of my Essential blenders as you can see

161
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,960
it's possible to get a lot of different

162
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
looks out of the blenders but I only use

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,199
a handful of these variants on a regular

164
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,000
basis one blender that is very useful is

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,800
the diffuse blender using very light

166
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,759
pressure allows you to slightly fuzz up

167
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
the pixels heavy pressure really

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
scatters them this brush works well for

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,919
blending colors together with a drier

170
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,520
appearance grainy blender has a similar

171
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
effect though the scattering is more

172
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,280
pronounced due to the texture being used

173
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,759
you can modify the pattern to get

174
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,919
different

175
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,160
textures let's try another brush called

176
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
water blender this blender emulates

177
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,440
blending transparent media with plain

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,039
water the edges of the brush are soft

179
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,080
which gives the blend a wet

180
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,440
appearance another useful blender is

181
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
blur I can use it to soften the edges of

182
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,039
objects to make them out of focus

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,840
lowering the opacity makes the blurring

184
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,080
more subtle this brush works well to add

185
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
depth and distance to your seene next is

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,360
oily blender this is an oily looking

187
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,160
blender that can also smudge around the

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,759
paint tilting your pen changes the angle

189
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,000
of the dab giving you more

190
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
randomization next up is coarse oily

191
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
blender this blender is similar to oily

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
blender but with a sharper more streaky

193
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,319
smudging also included with the blenders

194
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,759
are some Distortion brushes these are

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,919
not technically blenders but they can

196
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,759
mix up paint which borders on blending

197
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,000
for example I can use distort push to

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,759
mix the paint together which gives the

199
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,400
impression of blending if I mix for long

200
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
enough I will eventually create

201
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,520
intermediate colors we'll come back to

202
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,599
Distortion brushes in a later

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
lesson let's explore the variance in my

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
pallet knives category I'll return to

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
the brush testing template flat knife is

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,160
an excellent brush because it can add

207
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
paint and smudge at the same time if you

208
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
use heavy pressure you will apply paint

209
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,840
if you lighten your pressure the brush

210
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,639
runs out of paint and begins to smudge

211
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,160
the underlying colors returning to heavy

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,800
pressure adds paint again I love the way

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,599
I can lay down paint and then blend it

214
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,960
out it feels very natural as you can see

215
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I can create water Ripples and easily

216
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
give them form many of these pallet

217
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
knives are flat so they can be rotated

218
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,000
using tilt being able to rotate a flat

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
dab allows you to intuitively change the

220
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,159
shape of your marks to get a wide range

221
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,440
of effects from tree trunks to

222
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
foliage let's try the Mountain Knife

223
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,159
next this is a great brush for painting

224
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,240
silhouettes of mountains that fade into

225
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,599
mist lighter pressure will toggle to

226
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,199
mixing so you can smudge the paint the

227
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
mix property is being used so when you

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,240
use light pressure you'll get more of

229
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,280
the secondary color for a misty effect

230
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,440
make this white or a lighter shade I'll

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,120
paint a simple Mountain shape

232
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
let's try there is a broken pallet knife

233
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,000
that gives a nice paint break effect

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,640
where the paint sticks to the canvas in

235
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,559
some places and not in others as with a

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,679
traditional knife you can get more paint

237
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,159
brake with a light touch a heavy touch

238
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,720
will cover the texture

239
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
more I'll enable preserve Alpha and use

240
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
varied pressure to add some snow to one

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,959
side of the mountain shape make

242
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,360
subsequent overlapping Strokes to easily

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
control the buildup of the paint this is

244
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,560
another rgba brush that simulates imposs

245
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
you can modify the texture options to

246
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,440
change the texture of this brush in

247
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,519
particular contrast controls the fractal

248
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,720
pattern you can play with this property

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
alongside choosing different textures to

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,600
get a range of

251
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,839
effects the last thing I want to discuss

252
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,600
is using the right brush for the job

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
there are so many brushes that can do

254
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,519
essentially the same thing there are

255
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,160
probably a hundred brushes you could use

256
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,959
to create trees but you have to think

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,920
about what type of trees you want or

258
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,440
what kind of style you want for your

259
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,640
painting the best way to find the right

260
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
brush is to just experiment with

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
different brushes and take a look at

262
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,519
what they can do make observations about

263
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,040
how the brush looks and feels for

264
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,600
instance if you find a brush that looks

265
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,839
like it would work well for painting

266
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,680
trees you can save it as a tree brush

267
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,519
then any time you want to paint trees

268
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,240
use one of your tree brushes it wouldn't

269
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,959
make sense to use the airbrush to try

270
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,760
and paint leaves when there are brushes

271
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,240
that can do it more quickly and

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
effectively try to get the effect you

273
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
want in just a few Strokes rather than

274
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,279
spending all day rendering objects with

275
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,000
a basic brush as you work with cre more

276
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,399
and more you're going to start to

277
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
discover which brushes are valuable for

278
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
your workflow and if you take time to

279
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,959
save and categorize them you'll always

280
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,519
have the right brush available when you

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,720
need it that covers the brushes that I

282
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,160
consider to be essential for my

283
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
workflow
