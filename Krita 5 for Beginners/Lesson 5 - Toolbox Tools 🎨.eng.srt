1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
in this lesson we will explore some of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,319
the tools in the toolbox I'll

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,399
demonstrate on a blank 8x10 canvas we

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,200
already know what the brush tool can do

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,880
so we'll skip that one beside the brush

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,280
tool are the shape tools these have a

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,000
dual purpose first they can be used to

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,439
draw straight lines curves and geometric

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
shapes with the brush tool and second

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
they can be used to draw Vector shapes

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,960
Vector art is its own in-depth subject

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
and we'll be focusing more on creating

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
roster art in this course so I will only

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
give an overview of what you can do with

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,719
the vector tools and Creed it I have a

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,200
reference video you can watch if you

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
want to learn more about creating Vector

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,520
art the line tool will enable you to

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,360
draw straight lines with whatever brush

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,160
is currently selected tap and drag to

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,760
create the start and end points hold

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
still and you'll see a preview of the

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,680
line release to draw the line holding

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,280
shift will constrain the lines to 15Â°

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,039
angles you can also draw a line but

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,680
before releasing hold all to drag the

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,120
line to a new

28
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,159
location another way to access the

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,920
straight line mode is to select the

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,320
brush tool then hold V here's a pro tip

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,880
if you're using Windows 10 or 11 you can

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,040
download and install Microsoft power

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,159
toys which is a free application that

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,000
can add some Art and Design related

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
functions to your computer the feature I

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,360
want to focus on is the crosshairs under

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,920
Mouse utilities these are independent of

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,400
the crosshairs you get inside Creed

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,880
these work in any application and can be

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,720
enabled and disabled with a keyboard

41
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,040
shortcut mine is set to contrl alt shift

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,479
X I have a reference video you can watch

43
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,040
if you want to learn more as you can see

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,840
by enabling these I can use the

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,759
crosshairs to align the points of my

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,439
lines more easily now I can avoid

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,960
overdrawing the line when I am done with

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,759
them I can hide the windows crosshairs

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,799
with the same shortcut I have this

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,520
shortcut programm to a button on my

51
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,560
stream deck but you can also set it to

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,039
an Express key the straight line mode

53
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,960
also works with other brush tools

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,920
including the erasers and blenders I'll

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
explain how it works with Vector layers

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
later each tool has a set of properties

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
you can access from the tool options

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,040
panel I have mine docked on the left for

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,000
the straight line brush I can choose to

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,120
show or hide the line preview among

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,560
other settings most of the time if

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
you're using a tool you'll want to have

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,879
this panel open as well in addition to

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,000
drawing straight lines you can also draw

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
rectangles and ellipses you can even

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,040
choose to fill these shapes with a color

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,120
by choosing foreground color the fill

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,480
and stroke will be the same color

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
background color is the Swatch here in

70
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,560
the color selector you can use this to

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,760
choose a different color from the stroke

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,920
you can juxtapose these colors as well

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,800
you can also draw free form polygonal

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,080
shapes using the polygon and polyline

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
tools the polygon tool creates closed

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
shapes while the poly line tool creates

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,640
open shapes holding shift and clicking

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,200
will close the shape or end the line

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,920
the beer curve tool works well for

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,080
drawing curved lines but you'd be better

81
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,920
off using a vector layer for this since

82
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,640
you'd be able to edit the curves after

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,280
drawing them if you try this tool you'll

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
see that it can be cumbersome to work

85
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,400
with you have to drag out the curves at

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,920
each point if you'd like to draw these

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,120
shapes freehand with a bit of assistance

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
to make the line smoother straight you

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,680
can use the freehand path tool right now

90
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,920
it's set to curve so I can draw curved

91
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,760
lines that get smoothed out if I set it

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
is straight then I get lines that are

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,640
automatically straightened you can set

94
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,560
the tolerance of this smoothing as well

95
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,640
using the optimize value for a bit more

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
control over line smoothing you can use

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,799
the dynamic brush tool this has mass and

98
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,840
drag properties that concretely slow

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,000
down your brush making it easier to draw

100
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,319
accurately smoothing or brush

101
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,159
stabilization can be applied to the

102
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,959
regular freehand brush tools as well

103
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,079
basic smoothing adds a small amount of

104
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,519
smoothing to reduce wobble in your lines

105
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,840
without slowing them down too much this

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
is necessary if you're using an older

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
drawing tablet or a cheap brand that

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
doesn't have very good pen technology if

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
you're not having any stability issues

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,400
then you can leave smoothing disabled if

111
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
you want a higher amount of smoothing

112
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,079
then choose a weighted or stabilizer

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,040
higher values will stabilize your stroke

114
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,800
more in particular the stabilizer mode

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
really keeps your line from wobbling

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
even if you have a very shaky hand or

117
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,840
you're using a mouse to draw you can

118
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
fine-tune these settings to get the

119
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,080
exact degree of stabilization you need

120
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
the downside to all this Precision is

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,160
that a stable brush makes it very

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,560
difficult to draw fast and Loosely so

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,479
unless you need a very stable line for

124
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,800
inking or something of that nature leave

125
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,919
this setting very low or even disabled

126
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,960
since you cannot save smoothing settings

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,280
per brush it can be inconvenient to have

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
to keep turning it on and off what might

129
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,720
be easier is to make a custom keyboard

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,919
shortcut to enable and disable it and

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,960
maybe even program that to an Express

132
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,479
key the final tool in this row is the

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
multibrush tool this allows you to paint

134
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,880
with symmetry as you can see my line is

135
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,360
mirrored and I can create a nice mandala

136
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,840
effect I can edit the number of symmetry

137
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,680
planes known as brushes and even use

138
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,479
different modes to get various

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,960
effects the next row down contains the

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,759
move and transformation tools to really

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
explore what these can do we need to

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,919
have something on a couple of different

143
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,160
layers

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,800
you can click on the plus button in the

145
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,880
layers panel to create a new default

146
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,400
layer and draw something on both layers

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
or you can use my transform tool

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
template to follow along with me let's

149
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,759
start with the move tool you might get

150
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,680
this confused with the arrow shaped tool

151
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,639
near the top called the select shapes

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,400
tool but if you try to use that CR will

153
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,960
let you know it's intended for Vector

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,080
shapes whichever layer is currently

155
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,600
selected will be moved by the move tool

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
I'll select the red ball layer and I can

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
drag that layer around the canvas

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,960
I can even select multiple layers by

159
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,319
holding shift or control and move them

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,280
together I can also constrain the

161
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
movement of a layer to a horizontal or

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
vertical axis by holding shift a quick

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,960
way to select this tool is to press t to

164
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,000
the left in the toolbx is the transform

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
tool this tool allows you to move

166
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,080
objects around the canvas as well but it

167
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
can also enlarge reduce rotate and

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
distort layers but we'll come back to

169
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
that in a later lesson I'll select the

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,560
black ball layer and move then enlarge

171
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,240
it by dragging the outer edges of the

172
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,800
box or the corners when I am finished I

173
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,440
can end the transformation in a couple

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
of ways first I can select a different

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,000
tool like one of the brushes and second

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,319
I can press enter on my keyboard

177
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,800
pressing escape will reset the

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,759
transformation while keeping it active

179
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,280
sort of like an undo you can also press

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,800
contrl T to activate the transform

181
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,560
tool multiple layers can be transformed

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
as

183
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,960
well now that we know how to move layers

184
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
around and transform them we can go back

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
to the shape tools and briefly examine

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,520
how they can be used to draw in Vector

187
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,440
I'll return to the blank 8x10 canvas

188
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
you'll need to click the arrow next to

189
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,680
the plus button in the layers panel to

190
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
create a new vector layer to let cre

191
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
know that you want to use these tools

192
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
for Vector

193
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,440
illustration now if I use any of the

194
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
shape tools I will get a vector line

195
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
instead of a brush stroke I can use the

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
select shapes tool to move the shapes

197
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
and transform them like I can with a

198
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
default layer the advantage is that I

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
can also use the edit shape tool to

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,680
freely edit the shape of these lines for

201
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,479
example I can round the edges of this

202
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,039
Square by dragging the corner and in the

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
tool options if I choose convert to path

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
I'll get nodes that I can use to reshape

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,280
this more precisely you can also easily

206
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,199
edit the stroke and fill colors of

207
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,759
vector shapes in the tool options panel

208
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,360
you can even fill shapes with gradients

209
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,479
if I reshape the vector layer The Fill

210
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,159
adjusts automatically but perhaps the

211
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,440
greatest Advantage is that Vector art is

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
resolution indep dependent so it can be

213
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,599
enlarged without losing visual quality

214
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
to remove Vector shapes select them with

215
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
the select shapes tool and then press

216
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,360
delete or delete the entire layer again

217
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,280
to keep this course concise I won't say

218
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,800
much more about Vector art let's explore

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,560
the text tool next text is another type

220
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,280
of vector shape you can create in Crea

221
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
though you can add it to default layers

222
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
it's better to do it in Vector so you

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
don't lose visual quality when scaling

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
the font up and down drag a box where

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,240
you'd like to place the text the edit

226
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,399
text panel appears and you can use it to

227
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,559
enter your desired text and choose its

228
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,240
properties like font size and color you

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,599
can resize this panel to make it smaller

230
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,599
but unfortunately you have to close it

231
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,240
to do anything with a text layer this is

232
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
very inconvenient so I would recommend

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,760
using a different application for your

234
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,160
text if you use it a lot you can always

235
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,959
make the artwork in cre and then the

236
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,920
text and something else using a cross-

237
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,880
compatible file format like

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,320
PSD next we will go back down to the the

239
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,720
crop tool which can crop or enlarge the

240
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,079
canvas I'll load the canvas size

241
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,560
template to work with the crop tool is

242
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,279
most commonly used to make the canvas

243
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,920
smaller by trimming off excess space so

244
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
if I want to trim this canvas down I'll

245
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
drag a box where I want to remove the

246
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,160
canvas when you're cropping by eye

247
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,360
you're creating an arbitrary crop if

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
you're just posting your artwork to the

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,760
web the crop dimensions are not so

250
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,640
important but if you'll be printing your

251
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
work I'd recommend cropping to a

252
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,200
specific print size you can set a

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,079
specific crop size in the tool options

254
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,160
you can also lock and edit the aspect

255
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
ratio for example a setting of one will

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,720
make the crop perfectly Square I'm going

257
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,959
to press enter to commit that crop and

258
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,800
now that outside area has been trimmed

259
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
away this part of the painting will be

260
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,000
permanently removed if I save my artwork

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
if I want the cropped area to return I

262
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,760
can undo to the point before I had

263
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,839
applied the

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
crop I'll switch to a blank 8x10 canvas

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,399
and next is the gradient tool which

266
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,000
allows you to create a gradient by

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
dragging it across the canvas the

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,839
gradient will flow between the start and

269
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,160
end points you can also choose gradient

270
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,320
presets from the properties bar there is

271
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,240
a foreground color to transparent

272
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,519
gradient as well as many other color

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,480
combinations you can even change the

274
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,120
gradient shape from linear to radial and

275
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,800
many other

276
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,160
modes the sample tool we already

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,399
explored in an earlier lesson we can use

278
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,000
this to sample colors from the canvas

279
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,640
there's more that this tool can do but

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
we'll get into into that in a dedicated

281
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,240
lesson next is the paint bucket tool the

282
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,279
paint bucket tool can flood fill areas

283
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
of your canvas let's open the paint

284
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
bucket tool template for this the crop

285
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,639
tool is most commonly used to make the

286
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,639
canvas smaller by trimming off excess

287
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,639
space hard Edge brush this tool has a

288
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,600
lot of properties so let's expand the

289
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,160
panel to show them all I'll also reset

290
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,200
the settings so they are all at their

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,519
defaults basically the Paint Bucket

292
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,639
detects differences in color and uses

293
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,279
those differences to limit the color

294
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
fill to a specific boundary with these

295
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,800
settings here I can select the circle

296
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,480
lines layer and fill those shapes you

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
may notice that when you try to fill the

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,279
top right Circle the paint floods

299
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,560
outside of the shape that's because that

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
circle is not closed like the other

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,279
shapes so the paint has a way to escape

302
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,800
its boundary I'll undo those fills by

303
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,399
reverting my template you can do this by

304
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,000
simply reopening the file one key

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
feature to be aware of is the reference

306
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,560
setting the second option will allow the

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,360
paint Buton to detect differences in

308
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
color on all layers so if I select the

309
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,800
color fill layer and fill there The Fill

310
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,040
is separate from the line work by

311
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,760
growing the edge of the fill by two

312
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
pixels I can even get it to fill Beyond

313
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,440
the Edge of the line art this makes for

314
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,800
a clean more professional coloring job

315
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,839
the drag fill mode will even allow you

316
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,440
to drag across cells to fill them in

317
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,560
this can greatly speed up your coloring

318
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,120
workflow the enclos and fill tool is

319
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
another more advanced aned way to fill

320
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
line art I'll reset the settings and

321
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,560
revert the template you can choose from

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
a variety of ways to make a selection

323
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
including shapes a lasso or a brush I'll

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,920
choose the lasso next you can Define

325
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,399
exactly what should be filled in in this

326
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,800
case I'll set the target regions to any

327
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,760
surrounded by a specific color and

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,519
choose black since that's what we want

329
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,240
to use as the fill boundary I'll also

330
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
grow The Fill by two pixels set the

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
reference to all layers and fill onto

332
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,320
the fill layer now if I draw a selection

333
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,160
around the star shape you can see it's

334
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,440
filled in perfectly but the real

335
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,079
advantage of this tool is that I can

336
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,040
undo and then draw a selection around

337
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
the star and the circle to fill

338
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
everything at once this is very

339
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
time-saving if you have a lot of small

340
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,160
cells to fill in if you prefer you can

341
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
also use the brush mode to paint over

342
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
what you want to fill there is a lot

343
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,199
more you can do to fine-tune this tool

344
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,639
but it's too much to cover in this

345
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,079
course the techniques for coloring line

346
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
artart are something I cover in a

347
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,639
reference video so I will refer you to

348
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,680
that if you would like to learn more I

349
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,399
also have a reference video that covers

350
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,519
coloring specifically with the colorized

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
mask tool in cre so I won't repeat that

352
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,639
information here that concludes our

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,920
exploration of the toolbox there are a

354
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,720
few other tools we skipped over like the

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
selection Tools assistant and reference

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
image tools we will come back to these

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,399
in a later lesson tools such as the

358
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,399
measure smart patch and calligraphy I

359
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,959
don't find to be essential coming up

360
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,680
next we will be exploring the menu bar

361
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
commands like file edit

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Etc
