files from the course page before moving

forward this is a compressed folder that

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,000
you'll need to extract using a free

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,640
application called szip or by using the

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480

custom AR profile to the input folder

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,799
this will install a custom AR canvas

47
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,119
input settings profile which has some

48
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,360
custom keyboard

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
shortcuts next copy the entire

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,840
predefined image sizes folder to the

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
creat a resource folder this this will

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,960
load some predefined canvas sizes you

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
can choose from in the new document

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,680
menu after that you'll need to close and

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,800
reopen CR to get it to recognize the

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160

once you are finished you should now

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,680
have a workspace that very closely

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,120
matches the one I am using in my course

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
rather than install everything from my

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,959
workspace if you'd like to extract any

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,879
of the individual brushes or files from

67
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,160
my bundles simply duplicate the bundle

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,480
file and rename it to a zip file this

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,360
will allow you to see the custom content

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,280
within a bundle the paint op presets

71
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,879
folder is where you'll find the brushes

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
copy these to the same folder in the

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
creat a resource

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,280
Library it's important to note that you

75
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,239
need to use underscores rather than

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,680
spaces in the file names of your brushes

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,319
otherwise they may not be detected by

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,000
crto when you import them simply rename

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,799
the files in the file explorer if you

80
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,840
need to there may also be brush tips you

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
need to copy over to the corresponding

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
brushes

83
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
folder close and reopen cre to apply

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,760
those changes the new brushes will

85
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,920
appear in your local Resources directory

86
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,159
in the manage resources menu

87
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,159
alternatively you can copy the brushes

88
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,159
you want to a folder and then choose

89
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,879
import resources from the manage

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,080
resources

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
menu if you want to make a custom bundle

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
of my brushes grouped together with your

93
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,239
own custom brushes then you'll need to

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,640
copy all of the brushes you want to

95
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
bundle to the local Resources

96
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,480
directory you may need to add tags to

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,959
the brushes if you want to sort them

98
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:42,959
into

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,280
groups it will be easier to make the

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,000
bundle if you deactivate some of the

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,040
other unwanted brush bundles

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,079

right be sure to enable embed tags to

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
save those with the bundle as

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,680
well after that close C and delete the

110
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,760
brushes from the local resources library

111
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
to prevent

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,680
duplicates next reopen cre and import

113
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,279
your newly created bundle from the

114
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,639
manage resources

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,399
menu you may need to deactivate then

116
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,120
reactivate the new bundle to get the

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
tags to work properly now you have

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,000
merged my custom brushes with your own I

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,440
recommend going going into the cre a

120
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
resource library and backing up your

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,720
bundle in case you ever need to

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
reinstall

123
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,039
it
