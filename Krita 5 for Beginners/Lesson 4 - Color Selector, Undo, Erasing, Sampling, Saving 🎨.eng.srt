1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,520
one of the tools that you'll be using

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,199
the most while painting is the color

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,600
selector I prefer to use the artistic

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,760
color selector set to the HSI or hsy

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,759
modes because they better represent

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,799
natural color but there are others to

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,559
choose from like the classic HSV mode

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,480
the artistic color selector features a

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,600
circle that allows you to select a pure

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,600
color blue yellow red magenta green and

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,160
so on along with the saturation or

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,599
intensity of the color currently I am

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,560
using the HSI color mode so on the left

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,719
is a strip that shows the value or

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
brightness of the color if I choose the

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,559
wide gamut color selector this is closer

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,440
to what you'd see in most other art apps

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,440
now the Hue is on the outer ring and the

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,360
saturation and brightness are expressed

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,160
in a diamond shape moving left to right

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,600
controls the saturation and up and down

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
controls the brightness it's also

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,039
possible to control Hue saturation and

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,600
brightness with individual sliders

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,239
moving the sliders also affects the

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,320
color selector so if I move the Hue

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
slider you can see the Hue ring moving

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,720
in response I can also use the

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,760
saturation slider to make the color more

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,520
vibrant or more muted the third slider

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,159
controls the brightness which can be

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,680
used to make the color lighter or darker

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
and the fourth slider controls both the

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,640
saturation and brightness together to

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,560
get a more natural lightening or

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,759
darkening you can preview the color you

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,680
have selected in the color swatch in the

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,200
top left of the color selector in order

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,040
to select a color you can follow my

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,600
three-step process first think about the

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Hue of the color you want if I were

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
going to paint a daytime Sky then I'd

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,200
choose a color somewhere in between

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,399
Indigo and cyan step two is to decide

45
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,880
how light or dark I want the sky to be

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,240
I'll choose a blue that's bright for

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
step three I will decide how saturated

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,360
to make the color is it going to be an

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,960
overcast day and kind of muted or is it

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
going to be a bright sunny day and very

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,079
vibrant let's say it's going to be a

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,159
bright sunny day so I will choose a

53
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,119
saturated blue to recap I chose CH my

54
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,880
Hue first I chose my value second and I

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
chose my saturation third step number

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
two and three are interchangeable so it

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
doesn't really matter which property you

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,160
choose first in fact you can choose both

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,200
value and saturation at the same time if

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
you're using the wide gamut color

61
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,400
selector or hue and saturation together

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,319
if you're using the artistic color

63
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,680
selector I'll fill my canvas with that

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,599
blue color I'll also show the entire

65
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,840
canvas next if I want to add a bright

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,959
yellow sun in the sky I'll select yellow

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
for my hue and then obviously we don't

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,160
want a dark Sun or a dull Sun so the

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,200
color we choose needs to be bright and

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
saturated I'll choose a color for my sun

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
and then paint with the airbrush soft to

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,280
add it in another way to quickly select

73
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,560
a color is to use the pop-up panel you

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
can access this whenever the brush tool

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
is selected by right clicking on the

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,319
canvas the center is a color

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
selector that covers the basics of

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
selecting color in CR we will be going

79
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,319
more in- depth into color selection

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,120
later in this course now let's discuss

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
how to use undo and redo undo can remove

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
brush strokes and other operations one

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,319
at a time redo can bring them back if I

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,959
start drawing a series of lines

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
emanating from the Sun with airbrush

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,799
soft I can go to edit undo and each time

87
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,840
I do this one more brush jerk will be

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
removed until I reach my undo limit a

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
faster way to undo is to press contrl Z

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,840
on your keyboard you can redo with

91
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
control shift Z as I mentioned there is

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,200
a limit to how many undos you can use

93
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,480
you can find this setting under General

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
miscellaneous if I draw a lot of lines

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,680
and then I try to undo them all I'm

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,280
going to eventually reach my limit by

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
default the maximum is 200 but your

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,360
system may only be able to handle fewer

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,120
undos than that that's enough to go back

100
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,480
quite a ways but if I made more than 200

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,080
lines I wouldn't be able to go past that

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,799
I'll go ahead and set my undue limit to

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
32 since that will free up Computer

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,079
Resources and I hardly ever use more

105
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,439
than that another limitation is that

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,560
undo and redo information is cleared

107
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,319
when once you close a document or the

108
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,799
cre application rather than use the

109
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,840
keyboard for undo and redo you can also

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,879
use the welome tablet properties to set

111
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,760
one of your Express keys or your touch

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
ring to execute these

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,159
shortcuts now let's discuss erasing and

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,759
cre one way to erase brush Strokes from

115
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,120
your canvas is to select any eraser

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,680
brush there is an erasers category I'll

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,520
start with eraser soft the erasers work

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,199
similarly to a real world eraser lighter

119
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,960
pressure results in a thinner softer

120
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,160
erasing firmer pressure gradually

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
removes everything the Eraser tool can

122
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,400
erase any of the categories of media

123
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
because the canvas I am painting on is

124
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
blue that is what I get when I erase if

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
I change the background color to

126
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
something else I'll get that instead

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
there are other brush variants that can

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
be used to modify the shape and behavior

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
of your eraser for example there are

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
hard Edge square and textured erasers

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,039
just like with the brushes that apply

132
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,960
paint there are properties to change the

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,880
brush size an opacity of the Eraser so

134
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,199
if I want an eraser that erases slowly I

135
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,039
can set the opacity lower now the Eraser

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,880
takes time to build up and erase

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
completely it is also possible to create

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
your own erasers that can be customized

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
to erase with texture and other brush

140
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
properties but we will take a look at

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
how to do that a little bit later you

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
can also toggle any brush to become an

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,560
eraser with the keyboard shortcut of E

144
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,080
when you press it again you will return

145
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,479
to the normal brush Behavior this makes

146
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,199
it really easy to quickly switch between

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
AAS Ing and painting there's also an

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,319
icon for this in the properties bar the

149
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,080
pen included with your drawing tablet

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
might also have an eraser on the back

151
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,479
end the walkom proen does once I flip

152
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,560
the pen over and tap on the tablet crto

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,759
will recognize it you can select an

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
eraser brush with the Eraser end of the

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,800
pen and now when you use that end of the

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,759
pen you'll erase flip the pen back over

157
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,319
to return to drawing cre has basically

158
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,080
assigned two different brushes to your

159
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,120
pen just like the drawing end the Eraser

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,680
end of the pen is pressure sensitive so

161
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,800
I can erase lightly with light pressure

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
or I can erase more thoroughly with

163
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,479
heavy pressure I don't really use the

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,080
Eraser on my pen for erasing that often

165
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,039
nor do I really erase that much because

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,400
there are lots of other ways you can

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,520
remove marks or fix mistakes which we

168
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,160
will discuss later in these lessons if

169
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,039
your pen does not have an eraser like

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
the pro pen 3 then you will have to set

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,160
one of your pen buttons to erase now if

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I hold down this button on my pen it

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,039
temporarily activates the eraser tool if

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,000
I let go of the button then I can draw

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,639
again I prefer to keep one button set to

176
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,599
resize the brush with shift and the

177
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,520
other to rightclick so I will set them

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,919
back one thing that is also useful about

179
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,720
the Eraser end of your pen is that you

180
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,199
can use it to select something other

181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,440
than the Eraser for example you can

182
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,319
choose to have the Eraser and select a

183
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,400
blender or paintbrush rather than erase

184
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
simply tap on the canvas with the Eraser

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,680
end then use it to select a different

186
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,400
brush you can even use the Eraser end to

187
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,039
Pan the canvas with space bar and change

188
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,599
the brush size while holding shift I'll

189
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,120
leave it up to you to decide whether you

190
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,960
prefer to blend or erase with your

191
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,000
eraser and I blend more than I erase so

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,759
I'll reserve it for blending the Eraser

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,639
tool can be fully customized with

194
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,039
various brush properties you can choose

195
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,800
from a wide range of different brush

196
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,280
tips and you can add spacing and other

197
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,039
properties now this is a more

198
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,800
interesting looking eraser I'd of course

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
want to save this custom eraser if I

200
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
want to keep it but we'll look at how to

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,919
do that later in this

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
course next let's take a look at how to

203
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,919
sample colors I'll go to file open and I

204
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,319
will load the sampling template you can

205
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,000
find these in the artwork and templates

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,080
folder and the course resource files a

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,400
simple way to keep your colors

208
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,280
consistent throughout your artwork is to

209
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
sample colors that have already been

210
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
applied to your canvas to do that you

211
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,960
can select the sample color tool and

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
then click on a color on screen to

213
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,080
activate it in the color selector if I

214
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,960
sample a color and then select a brush

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,879
like the basic five size opacity

216
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
paintbrush I am able to paint with the

217
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,080
sampled color rather than selecting the

218
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,400
sample color tool with the brush tool

219
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,280
selected you can activate the sample

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
color tool at any time by holding down

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
alt on your keyboard by default control

222
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
is the keyboard shortcut for this but I

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,680
have changed it since most other art

224
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,319
apps use alt if you didn't install my

225
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,360
custom keyboard shortcuts you can change

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,199
this manually or leave it set to control

227
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,879
when you release the shortcut you will

228
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,759
return to the brush tool that's really

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
the quickest and easiest way to sample

230
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,559
color while you're painting if you

231
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,440
prefer you can also activate the sample

232
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,839
color tool using an Express key or a

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
button on your pen by default the sample

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
size is one pixel so occasionally the

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,360
color you get may not be what you expect

236
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
especially if you're sampling on a busy

237
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
image these pixels are very small and

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
very close together so it's difficult to

239
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,839
pick the same color twice it is possible

240
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,040
to sample a larger area to average the

241
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
colors but we will discuss us how to do

242
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,560
that a little bit later when sampling

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,399
you get a preview of the sampled color

244
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,360
in a Swatch next to your cursor now

245
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,839
let's move on to discuss some of the

246
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,480
basics of saving your artwork I'll make

247
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,279
some Modern Art and let's say that I

248
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,560
want to save this I'll go to the file

249
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
menu and I can choose either save or

250
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,600
save as I prefer to use save as because

251
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,360
it allows me to save iterations of my

252
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,480
work rather than save over a single

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
document there is a function for

254
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,680
iterative saving in cre but I like to

255
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,079
just save iterations manually after

256
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,279
choosing save I'll select a location

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,560
where I'll be able to find this file

258
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,839
then I'll give my file a name I'm going

259
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,560
to call it test save and then I'll

260
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,680
choose a file format the default file

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,360
format for cre is KRA and it will

262
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,720
preserve any proprietary cre layers or

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
features it's recommended that you save

264
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,320
the original copies of your artwork as

265
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,760
C.K to ensure full compatibility that's

266
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,680
not to say you cannot work between Crea

267
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,760
and Photoshop or other art applications

268
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,959
using the cross compatible PSD file

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,720
format because you can but be aware that

270
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
there are certain layer features that

271
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,240
are proprietary to cre and are not

272
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,959
compatible with the PSD file format you

273
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,200
also have the option of saving as PNG

274
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,720
jpeg Tiff and tons of other formats some

275
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,680
of these formats can be very helpful for

276
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,640
printing or posting on the web but we

277
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,880
will come back to that what's important

278
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,600
is that you always save your original

279
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
working file as a layered format such as

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,920
Creed K Photoshop PSD or tip if the

281
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
other file formats will flatten your

282
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,640
image and discard the individual layers

283
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
we haven't really talked very much about

284
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,800
the importance of layers but you'll be

285
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,480
using them a lot later in the course

286
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
addition to saving your original copy

287
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
you may also want to create additional

288
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,639
copies of your work in other formats and

289
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,040
sizes a quick way to do this is to

290
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
select export rather than save if you're

291
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,959
planning to print your work saving as a

292
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,680
tiff will give you the highest image

293
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
quality while preserving the layers in

294
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,680
your image I've already already saved my

295
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,760
original as a KRA so now I'll export to

296
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,200
save a copy as a tiff and name it test

297
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,639
save print if you're saving your artwork

298
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,360
to the web then you'll want to choose

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,240
PNG jpeg or possibly webp personally I

300
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,680
prefer PNG because it uses lossless

301
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
compression meaning that it's not going

302
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,399
to degrade the quality of your image in

303
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,200
order to make the file size smaller PNG

304
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,880
also supports transparent backgrounds

305
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,959
the jpeg format will produce a smaller

306
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,279
file size but it may degrade the quality

307
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,000
of your image by throwing away some

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,760
image and color details jpeg does not

309
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
support background transparency and will

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,079
fill the background with white so only

311
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,000
use jpeg if you must otherwise choose

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,240
PNG I'll select the PNG format and I'll

313
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
name the file test save web then I'll

314
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
save it when saving copies you may also

315
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,160
want to resize your image but we'll

316
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,839
discuss how to do that later in this

317
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,000
course if I look in the folder where I

318
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
saved those images I have my original

319
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,480
copy and K format which which preserves

320
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,360
the layers and the original detail of my

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,800
artwork then I have a highquality tiff

322
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,040
that I can print from and a PNG that I

323
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,639
can post to the web I'll return to cre

324
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,839
in my opinion the best way to save is to

325
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,680
use iterative saving iterative saving is

326
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,760
the process of saving sequential copies

327
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,120
of your artwork this can be a great way

328
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,160
to minimize risk while painting because

329
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,920
you'll always have an older version to

330
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
go back to if you make a major mistake

331
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
it's also useful to show the progress of

332
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,440
a painting there is a save incremental

333
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,160
version function in CR which will

334
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,959
automatically add a number to the file

335
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,079
name each time you save but to do it

336
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,199
manually just choose save as and then

337
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,959
add a number or other type of

338
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,040
descriptive label CR does offer an

339
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,480
autosave feature the options can be

340
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,959
found in general file handling you can

341
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,839
change the frequency and quantity of

342
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,639
saves or deactivate it alog together you

343
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,680
can even unhide the autosave files from

344
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,440
your file explorer if you like

345
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,560
organizing your files is is an essential

346
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
Habit to adopt especially if you create

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,680
artwork without proper organization it

348
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,360
can be easy for you to lose your work

349
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
due to forgetting where it was saved

350
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,240
accidental deletion or overwriting to

351
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
avoid this it's best to stay organized

352
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
from the start because trying to sort

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,519
through a disorganized collection of

354
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,600
artwork later will be timec consuming

355
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,639
and tedious create a folder or select a

356
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,360
hard drive that's dedicated to your

357
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,519
artwork if it helps create subfolders by

358
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,519
year or month and then by project name

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
what's important here is that you're

360
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,440
able to look in this folder and find a

361
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,519
specific painting very easily based on

362
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,880
the name and date to learn more about

363
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
file organization I have a reference

364
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,000
video you can watch those were some of

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,839
the basic functions and skills you'll be

366
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,040
