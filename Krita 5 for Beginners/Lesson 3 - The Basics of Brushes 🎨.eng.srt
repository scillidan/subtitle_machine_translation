1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,360
next we'll examine the brush categories

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,960
in more detail located on the left is

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,399
the brush presets panel as we learned in

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,480
the previous lesson these tools allow us

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,320
to paint on the canvas the brush presets

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,440
contain all the different types of media

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,840
such as markers oils and acrylics

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,039
pencils and pastels by default there is

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,039
one huge list of brushes but you can

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,840
filter the results to show specific

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,279
categories like paint or ink you can

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,279
adjust the icon size if you want to fit

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,480
more or less brushes on the screen

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
there are also brush bundles that you

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
can enable and disable to show more or

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,680
less

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,040
brushes let's try painting with a brush

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,920
in the paint grouping called wet

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,280
bristles let's pick a pink color and

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,160
then make a heavy to light stroke with

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,719
this brush if we compare that to another

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,440
variant of the paint brush that's in the

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,960
same category like bristles 3 large

24
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,199
smooth then you can see the stroke looks

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,719
a lot different the first variant has a

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
rounder dab with more oiliness and

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,079
bristle definition whereas the other

28
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,480
brush is much

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,719
flatter within this grouping of paint

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,760
brushes there are also a variety of

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,720
brush

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,240
Technologies for example I have basic

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
brushes wet brushes and even some

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,479
texture brushes depending on how you use

35
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,439
them the brushes in this category can be

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,840
used to create an oil acrylic or

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
watercolor look there are even some

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,600
brushes that are strictly blenders

39
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
because how you might use each brush is

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
fairly subjective the looks you can get

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
from a brush might be a lot different

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
than what's shown in the brush ey on I

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,280
encourage you to select some of these

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,079
brushes and try them out on the canvas

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
to see what they can do keep in mind

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,360
that when working digitally the brush

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,000
you select is not a literal

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,439
representation of the medium it emulates

49
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,320
but rather a tool that gives the effect

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
of that Medium if I select the sketch

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,960
chalk soft variant this is not an actual

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,920
stick of chalk that adds a powdery

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
substance to the canvas it's just a

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,039
brush that resembles the look and feel

55
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,079
of chalk calling this chalk is just a

56
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,719
way to describe the properties of the

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,000
brush think of the brush names and

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
categories as a suggestion not a

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,479
limitation on what you can create

60
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,560
traditional rules don't apply in this

61
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,160
space so feel free to draw with paint on

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
top of chalk or use watercolor over that

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,720
because you're a painting digitally you

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,519
can mix media together as much as you

65
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,800
like you can also change the look of the

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
paint on your canvas simply by blending

67
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,640
it for instance you can use an oily or

68
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,959
wet blender on a dry medium to make it

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,840
look wet nothing is in stone and there

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,000
are very few limitations on how you can

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,920
combine media from different categories

72
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,319
together therefore I encourage you to

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,239
use brushes from multiple categories in

74
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,760
your paintings just as well don't feel

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
restricted by the traditional mediums

76
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,720
like watercolor oil or acrylic instead

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,519
just explore the brushes that interest

78
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,280
you and use them to create your own

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
unique painting while it's okay to aim

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
for a specific mediums aesthetic it's

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
more important to choose the right tool

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,000
for the job whether it's a brush for

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,280
creating leaves on trees or a pallet

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,799
knife for distant water experiment with

85
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,400
different brushes to find what works

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,720
best for your needs you can even

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,959
customize and save your own brushes and

88
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,360
categorize them in a way that makes

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,519
sense to you before you go any further I

90
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,200
suggest dedicating some time to

91
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,879
exploring and experimenting with the

92
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,840
brushes and Crea to get a sense of the

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
different effects you can achieve don't

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,720
put pressure on yourself to create

95
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,120
finished artwork just have fun and play

96
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,400
around with the brushes you may want to

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
move the tool options out of the way so

98
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,080
you can expand the brush presets to see

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
more of the brushes at once you can also

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
keep track of your last used brushes in

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,840
the brush preset history panel to better

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
understand how to work with brushes and

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,519
CR let's explore the anatomy of a brush

104
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,920
each brush icon shows a preview of the

105
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,799
shape of the brush and some of its

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
properties let's get a better view of

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,840
how this soft chalk brush was made by

108
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,280
opening the brush editor from the

109
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
properties bar and looking under General

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,239
brush tip here we can see the dab or the

111
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,360
tip of the the brush as well as a sample

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
stroke when adjusting the properties you

113
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
can watch the stroke preview to see how

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,079
each property affects a stroke this

115
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,760
preview doesn't show everything a brush

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
can do so it can also be helpful to make

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,799
Strokes on the canvas to get a feel for

118
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,040
all of the properties of a brush the

119
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,959
brushes and Crea and most art

120
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,358
applications work by repeating a dab

121
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,800
along a stroke path a dab is a

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,840
pixel-based stamp that represents the

123
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,400
shape of the tip of your brush or tool

124
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,639
in traditional art terms the tips of a

125
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,320
bristle brush would be a dab if I change

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,960
to a different dab you can see the

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,360
stroke preview update but you cannot

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,400
paint with a dab alone that would be

129
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
like painting with a clean dry brush you

130
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,600
also need media applied to the dab so

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
that you can create a stroke on the

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
canvas the types of media you can

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,520
emulate can vary from oil paint to chalk

134
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,880
to watercolor and just like with a

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,120
traditional brush you can load oils or

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
watercolor on the same bristle brush

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,560
when you paint with this brush dab the

138
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
the shape of the bristles Remains the

139
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,280
Same but the media used can vary in the

140
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,160
paint category I'll choose the brush

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,919
called watercolor texture then I'll use

142
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,560
the brush tip section of the brush

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Editor to adjust the spacing of this

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,960
brush you can see the stroke preview

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,680
updates and real time as I move the

146
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,160
slider if I reduce the spacing all the

147
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,479
way down the dabs merge to become a

148
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,919
continuous Line This is How many of the

149
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,520
brushes were in cret I'll draw on the

150
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
canvas and you can see that it no longer

151
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,280
resembles individual splatters but if I

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,400
make dabs or click with my mouse they

153
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
look like splatters again if I increase

154
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,280
the spacing then you can see that there

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,160
are more gaps between the dabs and you

156
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,639
get more of a dotted line I can also

157
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,240
change the media that comes out of the

158
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,160
brush while keeping the brush shape

159
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,280
intact but that requires me to make a

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,919
custom brush which we will explore how

161
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,680
to do later it's as simple as that when

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
you were painting all you were doing is

163
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,960
repeating a dab loaded with media along

164
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,759
a

165
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,960
stroke now that you know how a brush

166
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
works let's learn some of the ways you

167
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,160
can customize your stroke properties

168
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll temporarily use a black background

169
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
so you can see the cursor more easily as

170
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
I demonstrate I have the basic five size

171
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
opacity paintbrush selected and if I

172
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
want to make the stroke wider or thinner

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,120
I can go to the properties and I could

174
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,639
choose a brush size there I can enter a

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,919
numeric value or there's a slider that I

176
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,720
can drag to increase or decrease the

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
brush size if you keep an eye on the

178
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
brush tiip preview you can see that it

179
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,360
resizes relative to the value you chose

180
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,560
the popup panel also offers a slider to

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
change the brush

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,520
size the second method for selecting a

183
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,720
brush size is to choose a diameter that

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
is relative to your canvas size in this

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,479
case you're not really concerned about a

186
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,639
specific brush size you just know that

187
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,800
you want a big medium or small brush you

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
could use the sliders in the properties

189
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,520
but a faster way to do it is to use a

190
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,360
keyboard shortcut hold down shift and

191
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
tap and drag your pen left or right on

192
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,879
the canvas that will create a a circle

193
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,319
that defines the diameter of your brush

194
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,840
in most cases the visual CU is fairly

195
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
accurate but some properties like

196
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,440
scatter or tilt may cause the brush

197
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,759
stroke to exceed the radius you defined

198
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,160
for example the texture spray brush far

199
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,919
exceeds its cursor I'll return to the

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,840
basic five size opacity brush most of

201
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,759
the time the brush diameter I choose

202
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,000
will be the maximum size of my brush if

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,919
I use maximum pen

204
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,199
pressure now let's say you have a brush

205
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,479
you want to be just a little bit larger

206
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,919
smaller you can press the left or right

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,720
bracket keys on your keyboard to change

208
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,280
the brush size and increments you may be

209
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,000
able to see that the cursor is growing

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,199
along with the slider movement I can

211
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,639
even hold the key down this lets me

212
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,039
easily fine-tune my brush if you're

213
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,080
drawing tablet has a touch ring you can

214
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,919
program it to use the bracket keys to

215
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,400
resize your brush that way as well there

216
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,159
are also Arrow buttons in the properties

217
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,879
bar you can use to resize the brush

218
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,599
here's my preferred method for resizing

219
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,800
the brush rather than using the shift

220
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,759
shortcut on your keyboard you can

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,400
program one of the buttons on your pen

222
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,000
to activate shift for example I have the

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
pro pen selected in the walkom tablet

224
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,199
properties and in the pen tab I have the

225
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,919
button that's nearest the tip of the pen

226
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,759
set to a modifier which is set to shift

227
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,080
the other pen button is set to

228
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,159
rightclick so if I want to resize my

229
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,080
brush now all I have to do is hold this

230
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,759
button down and drag my pen I can make a

231
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,199
large brush a small brush and everything

232
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,960
in

233
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,440
between another way to resize your brush

234
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,400
is by using pen pressure which we looked

235
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,599
at earlier if you're having trouble

236
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,679
controlling size with pressure you may

237
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,320
need to calibrate your pen pressure in

238
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,799
your tablet properties I tend to press

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,240
firmly when I draw so I set it one notch

240
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,719
toward firm do the opposite if you have

241
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,920
a light

242
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,360
touch now let's look at how to vary the

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
opacity of the brushes I'll demonstrate

244
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,200
on a medium gray canvas so you can see

245
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,480
this more easily I will select the

246
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,279
digital category and I will choose

247
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,200
airbrush soft if I paint with this brush

248
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
it gradually builds up the opacity based

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,040
on how hard you press if you press

250
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,800
lightly the paint will be thinner and

251
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,320
more transparent if you press harder the

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,760
paint will be thicker and more opaque we

253
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
can control the opacity of a brush from

254
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
the properties bar just like with the

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
brush size we can numerically enter an

256
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,240
opacity level let's say 50% and now the

257
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,760
brush will paint at 50% opacity using

258
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,480
maximum pressure if we set the opacity

259
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,760
to 2% then the paint is not going to be

260
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,640
as opaque when we make Strokes and it

261
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
will take more effort to build them up

262
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,040
to full opacity there's also an opacity

263
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,760
slider that we can drag or click on

264
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
another way to change the opacity is to

265
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,000
use the keyboard shortcuts of I and O

266
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,680
this will modify the opacity in 10%

267
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,640
increments you can even change the

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
opacity with a slider in the pop-up

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
panel typically I build up opacity

270
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,279
gradually using overlapping Strokes so I

271
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,440
don't usually change the opacity setting

272
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
unless I find that a brush is a bit too

273
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,000
strong or a bit too to

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,279
week those were some of the basics of

275
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,600
working with brushes in the next lesson

276
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
we will be exploring some of the

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
essential functions and cre such as

278
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,920
choosing color erasing sampling color

279
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,440
and saving

280
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
artwork
