1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,080
CR is a free open-source art application

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,319
for Windows Mac Linux and even Android

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,719
in my opinion it's by far the best free

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,480
option out there and it's better than

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,559
most paid art apps as well although Crea

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,079
is 100% free it would be wise to donate

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,760
to support the development if you want

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,480
this software to be around for the long

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,240
term C's development team is very

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,000
forward thinking and Innovative in many

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,960
respects CA is raising the bar on what

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
can be done to advance digital art

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,039
software while it's much more technical

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,520
than some of the other artart apps out

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,600
there it can be customized to be more

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,399
userfriendly Crea is a Powerhouse of

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,680
creative tools you can make drawings and

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,520
paintings create Vector art anime and

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,559
much more there's a lot Crea can do and

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,360
new features are added regularly in this

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,920
course we'll just focus on getting

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
started with CA using the tools and

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,719
features I feel are the most essential

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,760
for making art let's begin when you

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,160
first launch CR you will be greeted by a

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,440
new document dialogue let's just choose

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,199
a3300 from the list of preset sizes so

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
we can move on to some initial setup the

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
default layout is difficult to use

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,640
because it's not well organized for art

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,119
and it conceals a lot of useful features

32
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,080
so before we do anything else we'll need

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
to create a better layout to make this

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,439
quick and easy I have provided a layout

35
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,560
file you can import if you have the paid

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
version of this lesson you'll need to

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,880
follow the installation instructions

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,840
provided with the lesson if you're going

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,960
to set up the layout self everything you

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,920
see here can be found under settings

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,360
Dockers you may need to resize these

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,200
panels to fit your display if it's

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,079
larger or smaller than mine the next

44
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,520
most important thing to set up is your

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,200
drawing tablet you can use crto with a

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
mouse but you'll have a more natural

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
experience using a tablet with pressure

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,079
sensitivity Press B or select the brush

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
tool and choose the basic five size

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
brush from the brush presets palette on

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,439
the left select a gray color in the

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
color selector on the right and try

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,799
drawing on the canvas hopefully you'll

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,880
be able to make a mark and your cursor

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,878
aligns with your pen tip if so then try

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,840
to use light and heavy pressure to vary

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,080
the line width if that's all working

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,560
then you can skip the next step if your

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,720
tablet isn't working properly go to

60
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,920
settings configure Crea and look on the

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,760
left under tablet settings under tablet

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,400
input choose the appropriate option you

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
can choose between win tab which

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,920
includes walkom and similar brands or or

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
if you're using a Windows pen enabled

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
device then you might want to set this

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,920
to Windows 8/ Windows Inc restart cre

68
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,959
for the changes to take effect if

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,360
neither of those settings get your

70
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,959
tablet to work in cre I have a

71
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,680
troubleshooting video you can watch with

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
more solutions you can find links to

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
these reference videos in the written

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,440
transcript of this course I also

75
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,720
recommend that you watch my free

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
reference video about how to draw on a

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,599
tablet because that will go in depth

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
into how to set up and use your

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
tablet now that our tablet is working

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,360
working we can create a new canvas I can

81
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,560
click on the new button in the

82
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,760
properties bar in the top left or I can

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
go to file new let's start by looking at

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,319
the canvas Dimensions this defines how

85
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,920
large and what shape the canvas will be

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
there are a few key settings to consider

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,519
when creating a new canvas the width and

88
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,519
height determine the size of the canvas

89
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,120
and the resolution determines the

90
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,680
clarity and quality of the image

91
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,480
currently the unit of measurement is set

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,239
to pixels but you can also Choose inches

93
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,799
or something else if you're planning to

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,879
print your artwork inches is the most

95
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,319
common choice on the other hand if

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,120
you're creating artwork for the web

97
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,599
pixels is the better option for now

98
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,480
let's switch the unit of measurement to

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
inches it's important to choose a canvas

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
size that matches standard print and

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,080
frame sizes such as 4X 6 8x1 11x14 and

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,079
18x 24 this ensures that your artwork

103
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,040
fits the paper or canvas you're using

104
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,360
for your print if the size of the image

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,200
doesn't match your print size you'll

106
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,360
either have to crop the artwork or add a

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,360
border around it the new document window

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,640
offers several preset canvas sizes to

109
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,599
choose from and you can also create

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
custom preset sizes to use in the future

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,159
I've included some with the paid version

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,478
of this course that you can install

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,199
there are also Project Specific

114
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,160
templates with preset sizes for

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,919
animation Comics and More I'll choose

116
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,840
8x10 at 300 that's a standard 8x10 in

117
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,120
print at a standard 300 PPI for the

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,440
resolution

119
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,039
there's more to learn about resolution

120
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,880
in digital art so be sure to check out

121
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,360
my reference video on that topic in the

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,520
top right are the orientation buttons

123
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
you can use these to swap the width for

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
the height and rotate the canvas

125
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,600
orientation let's make this canvas wide

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
on the bottom of the new artwork window

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
you can see the canvas dimensions in

128
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,680
pixels and preview the RAM usage under

129
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,080
color you can select a color profile

130
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,160
since I am using a scentique display

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,560
with a wide color gamut I can show more

132
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,840
colors than srgb provides by choosing

133
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,479
Adobe RGB I can unlock more colors to

134
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,919
choose from when I paint the down side

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,440
is that the artwork might not look as

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
vibrant on a different display that only

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,320
supports

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
srgb if you click on content you'll get

139
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
more options for your canvas there are

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
lots of options here but the only one I

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
want to point out is the background

142
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,199
color this is the bottommost layer and

143
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,199
you may prefer it to be a light gray or

144
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,240
something other than a bright white you

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
can change this in the layers panel as

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,319
well I want mine to be a light gray

147
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,160
after that click on create to create

148
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,880
that new canvas because we already had a

149
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,360
canvas open you'll see two tabs at the

150
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,800
top of the interface you can use these

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
tabs to switch between multiple open

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
documents I'll close the leftmost one

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,120
since we don't need it let's use the

154
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,840
save button in the properties bar to

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,800
save our demonstration canvas so we can

156
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,080
reuse it I'll just call it blank canvas

157
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,440
8x10 after that I'll close that document

158
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
doent so we can see the welcome screen

159
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,039
when no documents are open the welcome

160
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,520
screen appears this gives you quick

161
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,800
access to your recent documents as well

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,639
as the new image and open buttons I'll

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,360
also mention that you can open saved

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,639
artwork and access your list of recently

165
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,840
open projects from the file menu as well

166
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,199
I created a document that is 10 in wide

167
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,800
by 8 in tall which now resides inside of

168
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,360
the cre interface you can imagine that

169
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,479
crea's user interface is like your desk

170
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,199
you have some of your tools on either

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
side just like you would if you were

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,840
working with traditional media you can

173
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,759
grab your paper and move it around your

174
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,280
desk you can also rotate the angle of

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
your paper or canvas and because you

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,520
working digitally you can even zoom into

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,280
your composition to look at it more

178
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,599
closely or you can zoom out to look at

179
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,880
it from a distance if your tablet

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
supports multi-touch that will make

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
navigation feel much more intuitive I'm

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
using a display tablet that supports

183
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,160
touch so I can easily manipulate my

184
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,120
camera canvas with my fingers but you

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,879
can do all of this navigation without a

186
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,120
touchcreen as well we'll take a look at

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
how to do that shortly just like your

188
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
desk crea's user interface is able to be

189
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
customized if I don't like my color

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
selector panel to be here I can simply

191
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
drag it to the other side of my screen I

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,680
can rearrange many of the items in the

193
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
cre interface to suit my workflow I can

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
even make the panels larger or smaller

195
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,960
try to find the balance between the

196
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,240
interface being easily visible to you

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
while conserving space for your canvas

198
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
if you've made any changes you can go to

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
the window menu and workspace new

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,599
workspace to back up your layout this

201
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,360
way if something gets messed up you can

202
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,919
easily restore it if you find you are

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,199
constantly moving the panels by accident

204
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,400
you can lock them with the lock

205
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,080
icons now that we've created a canvas

206
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,039
let's learn how to navigate cre in the

207
