1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,280
the final feature we will look at is the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,279
recorder which allows you to record a

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,680
time lapse I'll use an 8x10 in canvas

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,320
you may need to extend this panel

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,960
vertically to see all the options in

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,679
this panel there are two buttons near

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,320
the bottom the first will start and stop

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,680
the recording before you record be sure

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,960
to set up your record settings Above

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
This Will control the speed size and

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,480
quality of your video first choose the

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,080
directory where you want the captured

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,400
image frames to go there is a shortcut

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,960
to open this folder the capture interval

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,480
will control the speed a smaller value

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,600
will record more frames or more brush

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,719
Strokes making the video longer and more

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,440
detailed a larger value will record

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
fewer frames making the video shorter

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
and may miss some steps when choosing a

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,559
value keep in mind that when you export

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,360
your video you'll need to select the

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,920
frame rate which is set to 30 by default

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,559
but can be higher 60 frames per second

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,520
will give you smoother movement but will

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
also make the video duration shorter and

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,399
the file size larger divide the capture

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
interval by the number of frames per

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,438
second and that will give you the

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,360
duration of your video so for example if

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,880
I paint for 90 seconds at 1 frame per

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,640
second I will have generated 90 frames

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
at a frame rate of 30 frames per second

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,000
that would only be 3 seconds of

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,680
video The Format controls the quality

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,159
and file size of the recorded images PNG

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,920
will give you better quality but will

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
require more storage space on your

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,119
computer jpeg can be used fully of

40
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,880
quality is not a concern and smaller

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,399
file size is preferred in either case

42
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:35,840
you can choose the quality and

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,000
compression

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,880
values and finally resolution controls

45
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,360
the video Dimensions this is linked to

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,240
the size of your document so if you want

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
to capture maximum quality choose

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
original you can also choose a smaller

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
size if you want a smaller video for

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,240
example if I only require a 1080p video

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
I might be able to have the resolution

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,920
to save storage space I'll click the

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,880
record button to initiate the recording

54
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
it's important to note that only the

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,880
canvas will be captured not the UI or

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,199
cursor if you want to capture that stuff

57
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,199
you'll need something like OBS Studio

58
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,120
which is

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
free next I'll stop the recording then

60
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,319
click on export first things first if

61
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,640
ffmpeg is missing you aren't going to

62
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,040
get very far you'll need to install that

63
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and link to the ffmpeg exe file this is

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,160
what turns your captured frames into a

65
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,280
watchable video FPS can be 30 or 60 if

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,920
you want to speed up or slow down the

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,599
rate of your video you can make these

68
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,080
values different for example 6030 will

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
make the video twice as

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
fast you can also show a still preview

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,400
at the beginning or end of the video the

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
video Dimensions can be resized you can

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
stretch the video but that will add

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,840
block space around your canvas in this

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,239
case if I want to make a 1080p video

76
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,640
then I can make the width 1920 and the

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,000
height 1080 pixels if you will be

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
primarily recording your screen for

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,680
posting it to YouTube you may want to

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
start with a canvas size that matches

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,560
the video Dimensions so there isn't any

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,519
black space added to the edges when you

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
export the video under render as choose

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
h264 since it will be the most

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
compatible with other applications the

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,760
video location setting controls where

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
the exported video will go you can see

88
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
at the bottom of this panel with the

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,200
output video duration will be again you

90
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,519
can adjust the input fps to change the

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,159
video length click export and after the

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,680
video has been rendered you can watch

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
it whatever you capture in your

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,799
recordings is stored as snapshots so

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,360
you'll want to clear those out after

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
rendering the video If you no longer

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
need them otherwise they eat up space on

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,879
your

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
