1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,040
in this lesson we're going to explore

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,839
brush customization in more detail when

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,680
creating brushes everything you will

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,480
need can be found in the brush editor

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,000
panel expand the brush editor panel to

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
show all of the properties available but

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,719
try to conserve any wasted space this

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,640
panel makes it easy to modify the brush

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,279
properties while previewing those

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,160
changes in real time with the stroke

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,439
preview you can also paint onto your

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,119
canvas to evaluate the brushes while

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,640
you'll be doing the bulk of your brush

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,640
modification through the brush editor

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,080
the brush engines Define the

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,800
capabilities of the brush so that's

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
where you want to start when you're

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,440
creating a brush from scratch it can be

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,120
helpful to imagine that the brush you're

20
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,879
creating is an animal the brush engines

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
are where I can change a bird to a

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,440
mammal or a mammal to a reptile these

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
would be big drastic changes to the

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,559
behavior and appearance of the animal or

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,719
brush the changes made in the brush

26
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,199
editor can be more subtle in comparison

27
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,840
for example changing a pigeon to a

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
parrot or a parrot to an ostrich in

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,519
Brush terms I could turn a pencil into

30
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,519
charcoal with the brush editor but I

31
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:03,879
wouldn't be able to change charcoal to a

32
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,040
deformation brush that smudges pixels

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,600
unless I start with a different brush

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,119
engine unfortunately it's not as simple

35
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,640
as it could be to change the brush

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,280
engine of a brush what you'll need to do

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,159
is first select a default brush that is

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
using that engine and build your new

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,520
brush from that you can use the panel on

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,560
the left to filter out brushes that use

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
specific brush

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
engines let's start by exploring the

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,079
contents of the brush editor as we

44
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,400
looked at in early lessons this panel is

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,040
going to show you all of the relevant

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,759
properties for the currently selected

47
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,240
brush the contents will change depending

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,799
on the brush engine you have selected

49
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,600
these properties are divided by sections

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
for General color texture and masked

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
brush within those categories are the

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
properties each with numerous options

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
sliders and buttons that control

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,880
specific aspects of the brush nearest

55
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,159
the top are the general properties brush

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,360
tip blending mode opacity and flow these

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,079
are un unversal properties that can be

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,240
applied to many types of brushes though

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,840
some of the specialty brush engines have

60
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,200
their own unique set of properties you

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
may notice that some of the properties

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
are grayed out this is because these

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,200
properties are not applicable to the

64
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,760
currently selected brush the indented

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,879
properties are more advanced you'll need

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,080
to enable these by clicking first to the

67
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,840
left of the name if you see a check the

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,319
property has been applied to your brush

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,959
I can change the size spacing rotation

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
scatter and other properties that affect

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,400
the dab shape there's also a category of

72
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
color properties which control the color

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
of your brush Media or what comes out of

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,959
your brush you can lighten darken or

75
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,800
vary the Hue of your color as well as

76
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,480
control the buildup and mixing of colors

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
the texture properties contain the

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,519
various textures that you can apply to

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,959
dabs this is a key feature for brush

80
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,879
creation because it can really add a lot

81
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,280
of character to your brushes and the

82
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,040
Mast brush properties which are only

83
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040
applicable to the pixel brush engine

84
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,879
will allow you to Overlay a second dab

85
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,360
on top of your brush to create more

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,599
intricate get

87
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,200
strokes because C's brush settings are

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
so extensive I won't be able to cover

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
absolutely every combination of

90
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
properties that the brush editor is

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
capable of it's a lot but I am going to

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
teach you the fundamentals so that you

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
can experiment to discover the extent of

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,159
what it can do it would take a very long

95
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,120
time to try every possible combination

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
of brush properties in Crea by the time

97
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,159
you finally did Crea probably would have

98
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,799
changed and added new features that may

99
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,640
sound frustrating but that's actually a

100
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,560
good thing it means that there is a lot

101
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,680
of room to innovate and discover new

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,040
brushes I am able to create unique

103
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
brushes that no one has ever used and

104
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,799
that feels really

105
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,720
cool I'll select the basic five size

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,319
brush and if we look in general size we

107
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,080
can see that enable pen settings is

108
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,400
checked pressure is selected beneath

109
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,879
that which indicates that the pen

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
pressure I use when pressing on my

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
tablet will determine the size of the

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,239
brush you can use the graph to control

113
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,200
how much size variation you get when you

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,799
press down with your pen the horizontal

115
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,680
axis is how hard you are pressing from

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,760
low to high the vertical axis is size

117
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,879
variation from small to large pressure

118
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,400
is the most common way to control the

119
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,519
size property but just to explain how

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
these settings work let's choose tilt

121
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,160
Direction and disable pressure now when

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I tilt my pen in each Direction I can

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,918
vary the brush size pressure doesn't do

124
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,840
anything you'll find these brush

125
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
expressions in many of the properties

126
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,280
and you can control them in the same

127
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,600
manner I'll set this back to pressure St

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,280
Str is set to 100% this controls how

129
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
much the size will vary when I use

130
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,520
pressure If I make a stroke from light

131
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,479
to heavy you can see a lot of variation

132
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,320
if I set the strength lower you can see

133
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,560
that range is reduced so strength will

134
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
work in the same way for the other

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,199
properties as well I'll disable size and

136
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,759
let's look under opacity next this

137
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,240
controls the opacity of The Strokes

138
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,440
currently my strokes and dabs are fully

139
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
opaque but if I reduce the strength then

140
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,039
I can make semi-transparent Strokes and

141
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,560
dabs I'll set it back to 100% if I

142
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
enable pin settings and set it to

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,080
pressure then I can press lightly to

144
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,320
make my Strokes more transparent heavy

145
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,960
pressure will make them more opaque I

146
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,199
can even combine size with opacity to

147
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,520
get both Expressions

148
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,840
simultaneously flow is similar to

149
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,080
opacity but it controls the opacity of

150
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,960
each dab on the stroke rather than the

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,600
stroke as a hole I'll disable opacity

152
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,360
for some brushes you may want to change

153
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,199
the flow to make the brush build up more

154
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,440
slowly but in this case it creates

155
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
unsightly artifacts where the dabs and

156
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,639
strokes

157
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,840
overlap I'll enable scatter next this

158
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,560
will offset the position of some of the

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
dabs to break up the stroke a little

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,720
scatter will give you a jagged line a

161
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,800
high scatter value will create a spray

162
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,199
or splatter effect and again I can

163
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,720
control the scattering distance with

164
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
expressions like

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,880
pressure if I set the flow strength back

166
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,560
to 100% softness can be useful to make

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
your brush dab and strokes softer along

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,160
the edges this can help give the

169
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
appearance of a wetter medium a low

170
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,160
value will give you the softest

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
edges spacing is another important

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
property this controls the distance

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
between each dab and a stroke a low

174
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,240
value works best to create a continuous

175
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,599
stroke a high value works best for

176
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,800
creating a dashed line or a spray brush

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
any brushes that have had their

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
properties edited will show a pencil

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
icon in the brush presets panel

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,080
resetting a brush to its default is

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
quite easy just click either on the

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
reset button in the brush editor or the

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,039
properties

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,599
bar let's move back up to brush tip this

185
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,280
gives you control over the dab of your

186
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,039
brush for Pixel engine brushes you can

187
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,120
choose from Auto predefined or text

188
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,680
we'll only use the first two options

189
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
Auto can automatically generate dab

190
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,720
shapes you can choose from circular or

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,160
Square dabs change the edge hardness dab

192
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
flatness and dab angle and create

193
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,039
Speckles within each dab to simulate

194
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,319
bristles

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,840
for a more intricate dab you can choose

196
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,879
predefined this will let you pick from a

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,560
number of dab shapes and you can even

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
import your own either by drawing them

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,960
on the canvas and making a selection

200
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,199
around them or by saving them as a file

201
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
there are spacing settings here too this

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,039
works independently of the other spacing

203
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,319
property which is sort of extra spacing

204
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,479
that can be controlled with an

205
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,000
expression like pressure don't set the

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
value of the main spacing too low or

207
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,879
you'll create excessive dabs that will

208
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,360
cause the brush to lag I'll reset the

209
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
brush again painting with flat brushes

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
can be very useful just think about how

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
many flat traditional brushes there are

212
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,639
to flatten a dab you can either make

213
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,280
your own predefined dab or use the auto

214
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,400
mode under Auto I'll use a circular dab

215
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,319
and reduce the ratio to flatten the dab

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,240
next I'll add a rotation property and

217
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
set it to tilt Direction now I can angle

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,720
my pen to change the angle of the dab as

219
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,599
you can see I can easily make thick and

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
thin Strokes should you you need to

221
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
change the starting angle of the dab you

222
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,720
can do that in the brush tip under

223
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
angle the blending mode properties

224
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
control how your brush medium blends

225
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
with underlying colors does it simply

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
cover them opaquely or does it tint

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,879
darker like ink or watercolor would if

228
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,360
it's the lad then multiply or burn works

229
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,800
well to give you this effect in a sense

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
this property is able to change the

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,599
medium that comes out of your brush

232
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,440
there are many more modes which give you

233
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,759
non-traditional effects as well for

234
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,560
example you can build up glowing lights

235
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,479
with screen or color Dodge with this

236
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,120
brush the blending mode affects the

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,919
blending of each stroke but there's

238
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,399
another way it can work which I will

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,399
come back to in a second I'll set the

240
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
blending mode back to normal which is

241
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,000
the default opaque paint next we'll move

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,240
on to the color properties here you'll

243
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
find more properties that can affect the

244
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,640
color of the brush medium painting mode

245
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
can also affect how the blending mode

246
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
works wash gives you a glazing effect

247
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,079
where your dabs do not build up upon

248
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,240
each other to to see what I mean I'll

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
use the multiply blending mode again

250
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,839
when I overlap Strokes with both modes

251
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,399
you can see how the effect builds up

252
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
more rapidly and yields more unsightly

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
artifacts when I use buildup for many

254
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
mediums like marker you may want it to

255
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,399
build up rapidly but for others where

256
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,000
you want to overlap a stroke with more

257
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
control over the opacity wash is the way

258
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
to

259
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,959
go the source property can drastically

260
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
change the medium that comes out of your

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
brush for example it's set to plain

262
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
color for now but I can also get a

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,640
variety of effects using gradients noise

264
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,160
and patterns now instead of painting my

265
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,440
Strokes I'm getting something more

266
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,800
exotic in the middle there are a bunch

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
of color modes that can be applied to

268
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,000
your brush I'll reset this brush these

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
color properties are similar to The

270
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,399
blending mode but rather than affecting

271
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,399
underlying colors on the canvas they

272
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,240
only affect the color of the dabs if I

273
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
enable any of these I can also enable

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
pin settings to control the effects with

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,920
pressure or other Expressions I won't go

276
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
over over all of these but let's try

277
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,519
darken so we can see how it is supposed

278
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,680
to work I'll reduce the strength a bit

279
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,880
with my expression set to pen pressure I

280
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,760
can make light strokes and they appear

281
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,200
as my selected color but once I begin to

282
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,079
increase pressure my paint will begin to

283
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,519
gradually darken these tend to give you

284
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,519
unnatural effects but there are some

285
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,399
traditional media effects you can get as

286
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,160
well if you experiment it is possible to

287
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,200
combine blending modes with these dab

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,120
color modes as well we'll skip past

289
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,600
airbrush and r and move on to the next

290
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,880
category the next set of properties can

291
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
add texture to your brushes I'll reset

292
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,959
this brush and under pattern I'll first

293
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,800
enable it then select one of these

294
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,079
dotted patterns when I paint on the

295
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,800
canvas you can see that pattern

296
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,120
subtracted from my paint this is meant

297
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
to simulate the effect you'd get while

298
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,920
working on a textured Canvas OR with a

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,320
textured medium like chalk charcoal or

300
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,839
pastel I will be covering texture in its

301
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,959
own section so for now I won't say

302
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,480
anything else about it m brush is

303
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,839
something we will come back to in that

304
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,360
lesson as well I know that was a lot to

305
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,480
take in but the good news is that unless

306
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,600
you were creating brushes you need not

307
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
touch many of the properties in the

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,360
brush editor it's okay to tweak these

309
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
properties here and there but if you

310
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,160
find you're changing properties often

311
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,079
consider making multiple brush variants

312
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,160
instead because it could be more

313
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,440
efficient when creating a brush from

314
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,079
scratch start with the brush engine then

315
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,600
refine the brush with the brush editor

316
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
you can choose any of the default cre

317
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,200
brushes and then use them as a starting

318
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,720
point let's create a bristly looking

319
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,519
brush with thick oily paint from scratch

320
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,240
so you can see the process I'll start

321
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,600
with basic five size and reset it I want

322
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
to customize the shape of the dab first

323
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
so let's choose brush chip predefined

324
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
bristle Circle

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
sparse now it has a different bristly

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,480
appearance the spacing is too high so I

327
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
will decrease it just enough to where I

328
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,639
get a continuous

329
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
line I'd like to utilize textur as well

330
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
so let's enable it and add wo texture

331
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
now I get a canvas effect to make the

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,920
bristles not so repetitive I'll also add

333
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,040
a rotation property and set it to tilt

334
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
Direction now when I tilt my pen the

335
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
bristle dab

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
rotates now that I have defined the

337
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
basic look and behavior of my brush I

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
can begin to fine-tune it I think I'm

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,279
happy with the shape of the brush so

340
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,560
I'll refine the brush media I want

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,279
pressure to control the opacity of the

342
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,600
paint so I'll add that now the paint

343
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,120
looks a little wetter while the brush in

344
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,639
you've chosen tends to have the most

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,920
dramatic impact on the look of a brush

346
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,399
with the right settings the properties

347
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
in the brush editor can make some

348
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,399
extreme changes as well for instance I

349
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,279
can add some scatter to change this from

350
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,399
a single bristly stroke to a brush that

351
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
makes fine splatters this barely

352
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
resembles the previous version of this

353
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
brush however the behavior of the media

354
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,920
Remains the Same it's still wet looking

355
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
opaque

356
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,120
paint that should give you a pretty good

357
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
overview of how the brush engines work

358
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,959
alongside the brush editor

359
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,680
in order to save this brush for later

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,680
use you can save a new brush preset give

361
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,360
the brush a unique name so you can

362
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,800
differentiate it from the default brush

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
you can add a custom thumbnail as well

364
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,079
either create the thumbnail first and

365
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,959
save it as an image file or paint

366
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
directly onto the thumbnail area with

367
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
your chosen color since the dab and

368
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,560
stroke previews are not always helpful

369
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,360
the name can also help to remind you of

370
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,320
the brush Behavior or your intention

371
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,800
when you created it after saving you may

372
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
want to tag the brush to add it to a

373
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,880
category I recommend resetting the

374
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,639
original brush you started with when you

375
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,639
are

376
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
finished you can always rename your

377
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,079
brushes at any time simply click on the

378
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,880
pencil icon in the brush Editor to

379
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
change

380
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,639
it the changes you make to brushes will

381
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,160
be reflected in the Creed resource files

382
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
so if you want to keep your brushes

383
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
backed up you'll need to copy them once

384
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
they have been completed if you don't

385
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
want to always have to remember to

386
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,759
manually back up your brushes you can

387
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,680
also do it automatically using something

388
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,959
like Dropbox or one drive to back up

389
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,320
your cre library on a regular

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,240
basis managing brushes and cre can be

391
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,079
difficult compared to other art

392
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,320
applications any brushes you create will

393
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,360
be based off of existing brushes and

394
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,800
will be saved into the library or bundle

395
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,240
that brush is located in in this case

396
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
the brush I created was in the local

397
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
resources so to view the file I can go

398
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,759
to settings manage resources and then

399
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,720
open resource folder look in paint op

400
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,680
presets and you'll see any new brushes

401
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,800
and tags you created there it's

402
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,160
important to note that if you created

403
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,440
any custom brush tips those need to go

404
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,959
along with the brush presets if you move

405
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,399
backup or share them these can be found

406
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,440
in the brushes folder deleting brushes

407
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,639
is not very straightforward either you

408
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,600
need to do it from the manage resources

409
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,959
dialogue I can remove anything here

410
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,079
including brush tips bundles are library

411
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,120
of resources that can package content

412
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,320
together it can be tedious to create a

413
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,040
bundle since you have to select all of

414
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,639
the content individually if you disable

415
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,440
some of the bundles you aren't copying

416
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
content from that makes it easier to

417
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,800
sort through as you can see I've created

418
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
my own bundle with my custom brushes in

419
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,079
it you can install this on your computer

420
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
if you like the file can be found in the

421
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
resource files if you purchase the paid

422
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
course moving brushes and content

423
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,240
between bundles is tricky as well

424
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,920
technically a bundle file can be

425
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,360
duplicated and renamed to a zip file and

426
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,759
you can access the content within this

427
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,800
can be helpful to extract brushes and

428
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
other types of files

429
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,279
if you collect everything in your local

430
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,720
resources folder by copying or importing

431
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,079
it you can easily save a new bundle with

432
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,600
that content in

433
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,120
it to delete bundles and remove them

434
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,959
from CRE instead of just making them

435
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,120
inactive you must delete the bundle file

436
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,519
in your resources folder just be sure

437
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,000
those files are backed up if you don't

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,079
want to permanently lose

439
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,440
them
