00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,720
video we'll be learning about the rotate

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,780
tool and also the scale tool which will

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,669
let us scale and rotate our image or

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,219
just a certain selected part of our

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,730
image as well so to get started I'm

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,259
going to control Z will undo all these

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,359
changes go ahead and locate these tools

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,070
if you hover over it tells you about

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,169
them the rotate tool shift R is a

11
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,509
shortcut to access it and the scale tool

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,609
is right next to it it's shift s again

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,839
your icons may look a little bit

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,800
different than mine but don't worry

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,930
about that when we click on the tool we

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,630
get more options for it down below

17
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,520
sometimes for whatever reason you may be

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,100
on a different transform mode you might

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,710
be transforming your selection in this

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,300
case you might get an error message or

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,940
if you have something selected say we

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,200
were using the selection tool to select

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
a certain area we could rotate just the

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,320
selection but you probably don't want to

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,000
do that right off if we do this and hit

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,590
rotate it's just going to rotate our

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,810
selection and not our image so make sure

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,540
on the mode you're on the transform

29
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,560
layer not selection or path I'm going to

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,390
go to right click and just go to select

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,460
all so we're selecting our entire image

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,950
and then with the rotation tool selected

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,350
and in the transform mode under layer we

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,990
can just left click and hold and move

35
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,510
around like from right to left or up and

36
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,840
down to rotate this image when we think

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,130
we have it where we want we can click

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,200
rotate and it will rotate it to that

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,870
position notice we've kind of cut off we

40
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,340
haven't really cut off these areas

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,620
they're still there but they are outside

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,710
of our project or outside of the size of

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,050
our image so we would need to either

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,750
resize our image to get those or scale

45
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,000
down our selection so that brings us

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,380
into the next tool if we wanted to keep

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,810
these areas and maybe put a color in

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,000
over top of this transparency we can

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,890
left-click and select the scale tool and

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,080
it behaves very similarly we can just

51
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,290
left click and hold and scale down and

52
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,930
scale the size of our selected area

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,760
which in this case was the whole image

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,470
the scale tool also has this little box

55
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,000
in the center if we left click and hold

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,220
that it also has a move function so we

57
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,800
could move this and keep scaling it down

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,940
by just left clicking and holding

59
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,400
anywhere or we can also scale by

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,350
dragging these little boxes on the

61
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,630
corners we can even scale looks like

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,880
it's gonna scale uniformly but there's

63
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,230
some options we could change if we

64
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,110
wanted to squish this down we could come

65
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,630
over here under the options and check

66
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,090
this box here that says keep aspect

67
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,790
ratio or rather uncheck it and if we do

68
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,370
that then it'll allow us to squish this

69
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,970
down and kind of make it not not scale

70
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,940
it uniformly if that makes sense so pay

71
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,320
attention to the options we have over

72
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
here and that's gonna help you out a lot

73
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,490
with these tools let's jump over to a

74
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,170
different one I'm hit control Z and undo

75
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,840
everything we did to this let's go to an

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,610
image here actually let's do this one

77
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,770
real quick so in this image that has the

78
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,200
horizon is sort of off it's not the

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,630
level and if we wanted to level out that

80
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,910
horizon what we can do is just click on

81
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,040
the rotate tool and then the left-click

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,230
and a hold on this image and we could

83
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,640
try an eyeball it and get it to where we

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
want and then we can hit the rotate

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,780
button or hit the enter key on the

86
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,670
keyboard to actually rotate that and set

87
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,519
those changes but if I do control Z

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,380
there's another way we can do this which

89
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,900
is to create a guide we can hover over

90
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,530
it up here in this where it says how the

91
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,870
size of our image this kind of ruler

92
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,150
area we can left-click and hold down the

93
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,730
left mouse button and then just move to

94
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,519
the position we want and maybe we'll set

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,350
it right there and unclick now that

96
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,989
creates this blue dotted line that we

97
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,780
can use as a guide to rotate too we

98
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,769
could also do the same thing if we

99
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,019
wanted to from the left we can drag

100
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,610
another guide and we can drag as many as

101
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,200
we want we're gonna cover guides later

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
but to get rid of guides we click on the

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
move tool make sure we're we have

104
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,590
selected pick a layer or guide and you

105
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,540
can just drag it back off the screen and

106
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,940
it goes away so let's go back to the

107
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,769
rotate tool and now if we left click and

108
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,230
hold we can rotate this and try to match

109
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,060
it up with that line and that looks

110
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,590
pretty good there so we can hit the

111
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,989
enter key and now we've rotated this

112
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,579
image and it looks much better although

113
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,488
we do have sort of a black area here

114
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,680
this guide so see now we have some black

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,770
corners where we rotated so we could

116
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,090
crop in we've learn how to do that using

117
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,430
the crop tool we can left-click and kind

118
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,039
of create a crop area and sort of crop

119
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,289
this in nice how we want it to and then

120
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,300
hit enter now we've got a nice cropped

121
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
image with a level horizon so that's one

122
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,710
method to do that I'll show you another

123
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,810
method as well if you have an old image

124
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,729
like this this is an Old World War two

125
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,370
image from somewhere in Europe but if we

126
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,349
go to if we grab the selection tool

127
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:47,669
added let's grab the crop tool actually

128
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,069
if we go to we want to crop this out but

129
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,900
we don't want to lose any of the other

130
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,990
pixels in the image well we would have

131
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,210
sort of a line we have a white line at

132
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,550
the top a white line at the bottom so if

133
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,069
we wanted to rotate this before cropping

134
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,409
we could just do that with a guide we

135
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,330
could drag down a guide and then rotate

136
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,520
to it and maybe I'll keep that guide

137
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,229
there let me hit escape to get out of

138
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,840
the crop tool one other thing we can do

139
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,370
in the rotate though is we can

140
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,479
automatically crop as we rotate or as we

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,759
apply a rotate and to do that under the

142
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,340
tools there's this clipping and right

143
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,080
now it's set to adjust but if we click

144
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,070
on that we can go crop to result and so

145
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,380
if we set that to crop to result now

146
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,169
when we rotate this we can rotate it

147
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,419
around to get it sort of where we want

148
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,300
about level with that now we hit rotate

149
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,520
and it automatically crops the image and

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,969
in this case it's it cropped it out with

151
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,770
those white pixels around so I guess it

152
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,150
doesn't really help us much in this case

153
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,250
but we can come back over and then grab

154
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,060
the crop tool and get pretty close to in

155
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,219
there without losing a detail of the

156
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,680
image and hit our Enter key now we've

157
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,289
got a nice cropped image without losing

158
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:03,300
those some of that corner cutting out

159
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,520
some of this corner detail and let's

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,900
talk to on the resize tool a little bit

161
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,180
or on to this scale tool so scale will

162
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,000
let us scale whatever is selected we

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
turned off that uniform scale so that's

164
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,889
why it's allowing us to squish and sort

165
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,990
of change this around again that's a

166
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,270
keep aspect ratio as that box that'll

167
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,789
make it so we can scale uniformly also

168
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,800
the Shift key if we hold down the shift

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,870
key on the keyboard it allows us to get

170
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,089
into that sort of mode where it's not

171
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,289
keeping the aspect

172
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,240
show it also behaves the same where it

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,009
has a preview if we don't have the

174
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,960
preview selected it'll just show this

175
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,749
box and we can scale this box but we

176
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,639
don't actually resize the image until we

177
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,129
click scale and then it will just resize

178
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,770
and again notice what it's doing if i

179
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,930
zoom out here notice what it's really

180
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,479
doing is scaling the image down and then

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,089
keeping the size of our original image

182
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,919
there I'll get rid of this guide again

183
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,399
and so we need to crop into this another

184
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,139
way to do resize if you just want to

185
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,779
resize an image is that you can come up

186
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,669
here that's the one I use a lot I just

187
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,029
go to image and then go to scale image

188
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,639
and that gives us some more options for

189
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,439
scaling it if you know a certain size

190
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,709
you want it like 1920 wide listen would

191
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,379
be like 1375 if we keep the aspect ratio

192
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,419
and you can even adjust the resolution

193
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,599
to maybe something more like 96 dpi or

194
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,699
you can have it be if you wanted to

195
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,059
print it you can do 300 or 600 dpi we'll

196
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,249
touch more on dpi in the future so don't

197
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:36,779
worry that if that's throwing offer you

198
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,819
don't understand it but here I'm

199
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,129
basically upscaling this image I click

200
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,620
scale and it creates a larger image

201
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,319
without cutting off the sides I could

202
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,620
also go to image scale image and make it

203
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,300
incredibly tiny make it maybe 64 by 64

204
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,620
will distort it a little bit and hit

205
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,779
scale and then it shrinks it down but it

206
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,909
doesn't get that transparency around the

207
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:04,110
outside of our image well hopefully you

208
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,399
found that informative I want to show

209
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,080
you one more thing if we want to grab

210
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,139
this so we can go to select all I can do

211
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,659
control C on my keyboard to copy the

212
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,330
selected image and I could go paste this

213
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,740
and I wanted to put it like a watermark

214
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,399
on this image I can go ctrl V and it may

215
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,379
be larger than I want so what I can do

216
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,580
is scale this down and looks like since

217
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,129
this image is already grade scaled it's

218
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,229
going to put it's not going to show

219
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,539
color just the way that this image is so

220
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,880
let's put on this one instead ctrl V we

221
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,828
have this nice image here or this nice

222
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,769
set yeah image that we pasted it on here

223
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,799
and we can use the scale tool to change

224
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,150
the size of this

225
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,250
I didn't turn that back on we can change

226
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,650
the size of this here and we can also

227
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,760
rotate it around as a separate layer

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
like we've learned in the in past videos

229
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,110
hopefully that sheds some light on the

230
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,450
rotate and the scale tools go ahead and

231
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,380
leave your questions and comments below

232
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,880
if you have any and I look forward to

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,140
catching you in the next video
