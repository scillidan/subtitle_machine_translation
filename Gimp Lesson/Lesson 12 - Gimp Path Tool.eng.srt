00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,710
welcome to this tutorial series in

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,450
this series we'll be learning how to use

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,339
 from a very basic very beginner

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,320
level if you don't already have

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,490
installed you can get it for free on

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,679
windows linux and mac check out my other

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,030
video where I show how to download and

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,769
get it installed on your computer but

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,119
once it's installed and you open it up

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,410
for the first time it'll probably look

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,289
like this you've got separate windows so

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,210
it brings up three different windows

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,949
with tools in them we have a toolbox

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,349
over here with some different tool icons

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,630
we can click on as we click on those it

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,400
shows options for the tool at the bottom

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,160
of this dialog and then to the right

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,510
side there's some different tools too

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,040
that actually have different tabs we can

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,320
click on and it changes the different

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,750
tool we're on like channels and layer

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,240
and our undo history all of this stuff

23
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,790
can be customized how you like it so you

24
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,020
could move this to a different part of

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,000
your screen for example if you have

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,620
multiple monitors you could move it to a

27
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,450
different monitor but for the purposes

28
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,740
of this video I'm going to use a

29
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,260
different window mode and to do that

30
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,120
we're just gonna click on Windows and go

31
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,460
down to this single window mode and

32
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,470
check this box and what that will do is

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,540
throw all the tools into one window and

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,350
so if we resize this it's going to have

35
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,150
everything in one window we don't have

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,920
to worry about accidentally closing a

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,450
tool box or anything

38
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,820
everything's just in one big window so

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,560
again to do that it's under windows and

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,630
check this box called single window mode

41
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,490
I'm gonna be in single window mode this

42
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,460
entire tutorial series to get started

43
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,020
with a project we can come up here to

44
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,090
the top left hand corner and click on

45
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
file and there's a bunch of different

46
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,390
options we have we can create a new

47
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,640
project or we can open an existing image

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,070
on our computer and apply some changes

49
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,260
to it let's click on new and it brings

50
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,659
up this dialog here it lets us create a

51
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,120
new blank image that's gonna have a

52
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,840
width of 2000 and a height of 1984

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
that's in pixels which is a little dots

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
on your screen we can change this unit

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,780
if you're feeling more comfortable using

56
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,060
inches or maybe millimeters or

57
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
centimeters we can change to whatever

58
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,869
unit we want if we want to do inches

59
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,720
then that's about six and a half by six

60
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,820
and a half inches but we could do it we

61
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,818
can maybe change this and do an 8 by 10

62
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,150
so we have 8 inches wide by 10 inches

63
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,360
tall

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,070
now there's also Advanced Options here

65
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,360
but let's not worry about these right

66
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
now but if we click on Advanced Options

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,900
it brings in some more options for

68
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,210
creating our document for now let's just

69
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,890
click OK it really doesn't matter what

70
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,170
size you're working with and so we have

71
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,670
a nice eight we see there's a ruler

72
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,950
across the top here starting at 0 and

73
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,830
going over to 8 so this is 8 inches wide

74
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,010
and then the height is 10 inches we see

75
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,870
over here is a zero and if we scroll

76
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,050
down it's to about 10 inches so we have

77
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,970
a nice 8 by 10 almost like a page right

78
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,950
here and we can select some of these

79
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,990
tools maybe we come over here there's

80
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,600
this brush tool this paintbrush if we

81
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,220
left click on that we now have the

82
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,110
paintbrush tool selected we know that

83
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,420
because our mouse cursor changes to have

84
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,700
a little paintbrush on it now if we left

85
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,860
click and hold it kind of creates some

86
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,870
different shapes here or some different

87
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,580
that drawing whatever we want to draw

88
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,520
and so we can draw on here if we want to

89
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,410
undo you can hit control Z on your

90
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,420
keyboard and it'll undo the last stroke

91
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,820
you did ctrl Z on your keyboard does

92
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,860
that you can also go up here to the top

93
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,680
left under edit and click on edit and

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,140
just go to undo paintbrush and it'll

95
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,560
undo what we've done a stroke by stroke

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,330
so now we're back to blank and maybe we

97
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,950
want to click on this pencil instead if

98
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,989
we hover over this pencil tool it says

99
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,769
pencil hard edge painting using a brush

100
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,720
capital n that means if we click on it

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,000
we can use the paintbrush or if we're if

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,620
we're on a different tool we can always

103
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,110
hit the N key on our keyboard to quickly

104
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,420
get back to the paintbrush I mean I'm

105
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,090
sorry the pencil tool if we hover over a

106
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,820
paintbrush it also has a shortcut P so

107
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,160
press P on the keyboard we're now using

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,830
our paintbrush and on the keyboard we're

109
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,380
now using our pencil tool and those are

110
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,790
actually customizable if you don't like

111
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,290
those shortcuts you can change them you

112
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,299
don't have to use the shortcuts hover

113
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,769
over this tool right here is called the

114
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,690
eraser tool if we left click on eraser

115
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,060
we can now erase different things here

116
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,100
but we see we're erasing kind of small

117
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,260
if we want our eraser to be bigger we

118
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,510
can change the size all the different

119
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,610
settings for these tools are found right

120
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,320
below these tools in this little

121
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,048
dialogue here it's a little bit cramped

122
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:20,829
in here right now

123
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,750
if we want to see this differently we

124
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,150
can hover over in between right next to

125
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,870
the ruler and this toolbox

126
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,630
over here left click and hold and we can

127
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,660
drag this out so it's larger we get it

128
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,389
as large as we want and it's sort of

129
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,169
reset rearranges these columns and rows

130
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,270
for the different tools maybe that's a

131
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,949
good one there so that we can read more

132
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,810
what's happening with these so let's see

133
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,040
eraser tool if you want to change the

134
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,580
size we can click plus over here or - to

135
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,340
change the size we can also just double

136
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,020
click within the number and type in a

137
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,669
value so if we click in here and then we

138
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,530
can erase that and type in like 100 for

139
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,570
example now the size is going to be 100

140
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,150
I think that's in pixels anyway and so

141
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,720
we can now erase this we can also scroll

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,940
our mouse wheel in here I'm just using

143
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,010
the scroll wheel on my mouse to increase

144
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,169
the size so now it's even larger and we

145
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,780
can erase much larger and as another way

146
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,610
to change this we can just click in here

147
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,440
click and hold our left mouse button and

148
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,479
move our mouse from right to left and

149
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,729
that'll also change the size so now our

150
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,039
erase is very very large and we can come

151
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,780
in here and erase this if we

152
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,250
accidentally erase something we didn't

153
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,289
want to erase we can hit ctrl Z on the

154
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:36,289
keyboard to bring it back or if we

155
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,060
wanted to redo that erase we can go up

156
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,050
to edit and we can do redo erase or it's

157
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,060
control Y is the shortcut for that but

158
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,680
redo will rearrange the and control Y we

159
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,020
can toggle back and forth between undo

160
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,960
and redo our history keeps track of

161
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,060
our history and we can find it over here

162
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,070
we see our different history and we can

163
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,080
look through this history and see all

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,150
the different changes we've made and we

165
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,830
can jump to certain points in our

166
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,080
history but don't pay much attention to

167
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
that now other than knowing there's

168
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
layers and history and different things

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,300
we can toggle on these different

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,919
toolbars and that's just going to be

171
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,560
something very similar on every

172
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,270
different dialog there's these little

173
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,580
icons we can click to get to different

174
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,979
points of them so just be aware of that

175
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,410
these are all customizable we can move

176
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,090
them around and change them but for now

177
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,650
let's just ignore everything over here

178
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,660
to the right and let's only play with

179
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,940
clicking on different tools here and

180
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,530
then looking at the settings they have

181
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,750
below another good setting we can look

182
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,159
at or another good tool is this

183
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,380
magnification this is zoom this

184
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,820
magnifier glass

185
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,340
when this is selected we can click and

186
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,160
left-click and zoom either out or zoom

187
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,890
in so we can zoom in very far here and

188
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,480
I've zoomed in really far so I'm just

189
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,610
seeing white so if I want to zoom out I

190
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,590
can come over to the options for this

191
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,480
tool and click the zoom out with my left

192
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
mouse button and now I can left-click

193
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,610
and we'll slowly start to zoom out and

194
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,160
see get to a certain part if this is how

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,230
sumed and we want to be we can stay at

196
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,690
this point select maybe our pencil tool

197
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,330
and left-click and draw with it and we

198
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,220
see it's taking on the brush settings

199
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,160
that we apply it to the eraser so if we

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,110
want to make this smaller we can come

201
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,700
over to the size and left-click and

202
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,890
change it to small or we can reset it to

203
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,450
the default by clicking this little icon

204
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,570
here if we hover over it tells us what

205
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,940
this does reset the aspect ratio reset

206
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,490
the spacing so we can reset the size and

207
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,310
now it's small again if we want to get

208
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,760
to a different portion of our drawing we

209
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,710
can use these sliders over here we can

210
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,980
left-click and slide up and down to get

211
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,810
to a lower part then we can keep drawing

212
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,660
and then slide down and there's also a

213
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,670
slider across the bottom as well so we

214
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,040
didn't slide from left to right another

215
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,350
way to do that is just hold down the the

216
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,660
control wheel on your mouse and it

217
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,640
creates this sort of hand grab icon it's

218
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,280
like grabbing the entire canvas and just

219
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,430
moving to a certain point and there's

220
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,750
lots of different shortcuts we'll learn

221
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,550
but for now it's good to get familiar

222
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,800
with just using the different tools we

223
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,630
can zoom out here and left-click and

224
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,530
quickly zoom out we're going to talk

225
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,090
about changing the color in the next

226
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,740
video that's just right here we click

227
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,690
and we can change our color but we'll

228
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,980
learn more about this it gets a little

229
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,840
bit complex and will sort of take that

230
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,060
apart and learn it in the next video for

231
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,380
now I just want to show you if we get

232
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,030
something drawn like this and we want to

233
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,820
save our project we can go to the top

234
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,710
left hand corner again and go to file

235
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,409
and this time we can go to save or we

236
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,030
can go to export it depends on what we

237
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,099
want to do with this picture if we want

238
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,500
to save it and work on it later we click

239
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,200
save that brings up this dialog box that

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,110
lets us save the project on our computer

241
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,540
we see that last three letters is a dot

242
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,450
xcf file which is a project

243
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,850
file so we just changed the first part

244
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,540
of this to my project or whatever you

245
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,580
want to call it and then it will save it

246
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,860
in documents is where I'm saved that you

247
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,200
can change put it in pictures maybe or a

248
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,150
certain folder on your computer and I'll

249
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,550
click Save and then that will save it to

250
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,010
the documents in my computer but again

251
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,560
it's a project file so where's my

252
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,890
documents right here so here's this file

253
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,380
that we've created that Sadaat xcf it's

254
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,240
not going to be really compatible people

255
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
can't open this with just everyday

256
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,700
software they have to have a or a

257
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,650
program that can open this type of file

258
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,630
so we don't want to send this to someone

259
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,670
in an email or upload it to a blog or a

260
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,610
web page we can't really print this very

261
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,790
easily without using we want to

262
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,410
convert this if we want to share this

263
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,840
what we would do is export this image

264
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,410
instead so to do that we go file and we

265
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,660
go to export and that's sort of like

266
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,150
developing the picture as it's sort of

267
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,680
like when it's set in stone and we're

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
done making changes to it then we go to

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,470
export and you can export and save it's

270
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,820
a good idea to save your project and

271
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,400
then also export and so again now we see

272
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,160
under the export options it's a dot PNG

273
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,410
which is an image file we can change

274
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,730
that as well but we'll just leave it

275
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,110
call it whatever you want to make sure

276
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,590
it's a dot PNG file and hit export and

277
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,930
then it brings up this dialog with some

278
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,060
more advanced options just leave

279
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,860
everything how it is here and hit export

280
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,430
and then it exports this image don't get

281
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,590
overwhelmed in settings

282
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,720
 is very well organized from the

283
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,250
beginning to just leave everything at

284
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,930
default and then as you get more

285
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,760
comfortable and more advanced I'm using

286
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,710
it you can maybe play with and tweak

287
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,990
some of those advanced settings and so

288
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,610
now we can minimize this and go to the

289
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,750
location on our computer that we've

290
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,120
saved I saved it in My Documents and we

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,390
see we have to now a project file which

292
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,760
is dot xcf if we click on this it'll

293
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,800
open it up in and then we also have

294
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,350
an image file they look the same but the

295
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,660
image file is a more compatible format

296
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,600
we can send we can upload to our blog or

297
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
a website or we can print this take it

298
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
to like Walgreens or summer and have it

299
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
printed and

300
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,329
be like what but this is just like a PNG

301
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,269
image okay and it's just being displayed

302
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,980
we can't make changes to it right here

303
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,220
it's just an image file and you can

304
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,329
learn if you're not familiar with that

305
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,069
this may be outside the scope of this is

306
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,540
learning about different image formats

307
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,370
but just know there's two different ways

308
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,009
in we do file save to save our

309
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,779
project and work on it in the future and

310
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,509
then export exports a final finished

311
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,399
image and you can make changes and

312
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,019
export it as many times as you want we

313
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,670
could now export and call it something

314
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,920
different but we'll play with that more

315
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,600
in the future too so play with these

316
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,240
brushes play with the eraser tool learn

317
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,190
how to go ahead and play with some of

318
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,480
these different things like spacing and

319
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,980
hardness and see how it affects your

320
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,380
brush and in the next video we'll be

321
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,389
learning about color and some more of

322
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,000
different tools that we can use in

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,649
leave your questions or comments below

324
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,209
if you have any and I'll catch you in

325
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:58,870
the next video
