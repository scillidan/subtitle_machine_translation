00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,980
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,240
video we're going to be looking at the

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,009
text tool in and learn how to

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,099
create and modify text within go

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,509
ahead and locate your text tool it's

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,999
going to be maybe the letter A icon and

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,310
with this icon set if we hover over we

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,349
can see the shortcut key to get into

9
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:21,839
this is T T for text so if we're in the

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,699
move tool for example we can hit the T

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,679
key on our keyboard to quickly get into

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,900
this tool and also once we're in the

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,400
tool we see some different options for

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,589
it right down here we see what type of

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,260
font it is this is a serif font the size

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,870
currently is 60 and the color is black

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,310
and there's some different options here

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,850
as well

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,010
so that means when we go to create this

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,320
if we just left-click in here it creates

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
these four boxes this is our sort of our

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,580
dynamic text box and we can just start

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,390
typing in right now we type our text and

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,160
sure enough it's the color it's black

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,320
it's using this serif font and the size

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,620
is 60 now if we want to change it or

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,240
change any part of it we can select

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,700
maybe if we want this is to be larger we

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,949
just left click and hold to select those

30
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,440
two letters and then we can change the

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,260
size up here by going plus and minus and

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,780
so we can make just those larger if we

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,030
want just a certain letter to be much

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,560
larger we select that letter by

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
left-clicking and dragging till it has a

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,970
box around it and then we can use plus

37
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,490
and minus up here to change we don't use

38
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,500
the plus and minus over here because

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,330
that's going to change the entire

40
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,490
selection or it's going to change the

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,740
attributes for the next text box that we

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,310
create so whatever is selected is going

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,950
to be what's changed up here we can also

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,750
double click and just type in a value so

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,640
150 we can make a giant s there notice

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,470
something you want to pay attention to

47
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,330
is if you bring in an image and I have

48
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,520
one loaded in here actually before we do

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,049
this I want to call your attention to

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,659
the layers when we created this we've

51
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,970
created a text layer on top of our white

52
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,520
background which means if we ever want

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,049
to we can get back in here and edit it

54
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,900
say we're using the move tool or maybe

55
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,510
we select something we want to get back

56
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,399
in and edit this text all we have to do

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,979
is click on the text tool and then click

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,680
in here and we can erase

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,359
and start typing in something else if we

60
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:18,180
want to do we can also resize the text

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,219
box by dragging these handles over here

62
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,219
and if we want to move it around we

63
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,019
could use the move tool but you can also

64
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,030
hold down the Alt key on your keyboard

65
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,549
and just click somewhere within the text

66
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,579
box and drag this moves the entire text

67
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,579
box and again to resize the text box you

68
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,150
can hover to the top or the sides and

69
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,430
notice if you do resize it since this is

70
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,299
a dynamic text box it will kind of push

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,750
the the text to the next portion of the

72
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,760
box that makes sense it won't run off

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,709
the side but it will run off the tops

74
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,829
and the bottoms okay I'm going to go to

75
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,599
this image here because this is a quite

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,909
a large image we can see it's like five

77
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,829
thousand pixels by thirty five hundred

78
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,980
pixels and it's 300 dpi so if we grab

79
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,409
the same text tool with the same

80
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,219
settings the 60 size and we click and we

81
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,340
start typing in that same thing notice

82
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,379
it's much much smaller it appears to be

83
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,440
smaller and that's because the image is

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,349
so much larger so relative to this image

85
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,629
size the text appears to be small but it

86
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,519
is still the same size as it was over

87
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,409
here at least before we started messing

88
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,510
with it so to change the size again we

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,459
can come over here and just change the

90
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,379
size of the text we can click in here

91
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,379
and type in 150 and get some larger text

92
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,269
we might also want to change the color

93
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,430
if I move this over top of the green

94
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,229
leaf by holding down the Alt key and I

95
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:45,930
drag it on top of the leaf now it's hard

96
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,669
to see that so we might want a lighter

97
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,919
color text we can click over here and

98
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,259
change the color we can change it to

99
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,629
something maybe like a light blue and

100
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,239
then we go okay now that stands out a

101
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,329
little bit better again the color change

102
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,419
is happening here in the text options

103
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,359
and not the color selector here where we

104
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,359
would change it for our brush so make

105
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,870
sure you pay attention to that but we

106
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,549
can bring in some text so maybe I'll

107
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,620
come back here well I can do it right

108
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,358
here if we want to draw a text box

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,279
another thing we can do is create a new

110
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,279
text box by left clicking and holding

111
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,099
and dragging that down then we can

112
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,520
create a specific area

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,180
to keep our text within and I have a on

114
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,970
my desktop a file just a text file of

115
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,849
some sample text it looks like this just

116
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,819
sample just Latin I believe satin satin

117
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,240
sample Latin text and I could copy it I

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,819
could just highlight it all and

119
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,710
right-click and go copy and then bring

120
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,990
it in here right-click and go paste to

121
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,759
get that text in here but I'm gonna go

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,990
ctrl Z oh it's not let us ctrl Z because

123
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,629
something we could also do is when we

124
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,280
have our text box created I can right

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,460
click and I can go open text file and

126
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,039
that lets me choose a text file on my

127
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,990
computer that already has text in it and

128
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,419
it will bring it in text cannot be

129
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,039
rendered it is likely too big please

130
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,500
make sure please make it shorter or use

131
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,060
a smaller font so this is just a notice

132
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,610
saying it's running off the edge but

133
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,500
what I could do I wonder if it brought

134
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,110
it all in if I resize this so there's

135
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,599
more text under here that I can access

136
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,659
by just resizing this box to display all

137
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,669
of the text so that's a nice warning

138
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,020
that it gave me that I was cutting off

139
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,530
some of the text I'm moving this by

140
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,909
holding down the Alt key I've mentioned

141
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,830
that a few times but we could also grab

142
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,319
the move tool and it moves just like we

143
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,969
would expect any other layer so here we

144
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,680
have three layers we have this blue text

145
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,710
this blacks black text and then also the

146
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,289
actual image so I can set this to move

147
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,750
active layer and make sure I'm selected

148
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,580
on the layer I want to move and I can

149
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,900
just left click and move this without

150
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,650
having to press the Alt key I want to

151
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,650
show something here we can this turn off

152
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,150
just like we would any layer we can turn

153
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,880
off and view this without one of the

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,330
layers so we could also I'll move this

155
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,469
out of the way because I want to show

156
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,900
something we can do if we want to edit

157
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,669
something in here we get back into the

158
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,680
text tool to do an edit it's not the

159
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,810
selection tool if we try to select the

160
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,909
text it's going to select the pixels of

161
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,389
that text on that text layer but if we

162
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,219
want to get in and edit this we can

163
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,699
select it we could go to select all we

164
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,520
can select it with or click inside of it

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,900
it what I mean to say with the text tool

166
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,930
were active and then we can make changes

167
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,849
so under here there's this justification

168
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:40,840
so

169
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,850
we want all this text to be centered we

170
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,580
can click here to Center all the text we

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,949
can put it in sort of a paragraph format

172
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,220
with the edges aligned so the edges all

173
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,720
the text runs to the edges and it

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,820
creates some spacing to create sort of a

175
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,790
more of a block of text we can do right

176
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,040
justified or left justified we could

177
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,530
indent this first word by we can hover

178
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,930
over and read what these are but this

179
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,449
top one is the indent and we can indent

180
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,310
that first word by making this a little

181
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,919
bit larger or we can type in a quite a

182
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,470
large value and see how that indents it

183
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,910
again it's going to be different

184
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,550
depending on what size image you're

185
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,160
using so a 800 pixels is usually quite a

186
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,380
large indentation but since this is a

187
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,260
large image it doesn't really add this a

188
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,630
little bit dramatic anyway the next one

189
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,180
here this is the line spacing and the

190
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,340
font spacing or the letter spacing so

191
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,780
this is what you do like remember when

192
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,100
you're in school and you had to write an

193
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,620
essay and you had to have like five

194
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,080
pages you'd like stretch the the spacing

195
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,910
between the lines that's exactly what

196
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,889
this tool here does and if you really

197
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,050
want to get creative you could adjust

198
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,810
the spacing between letters anyway

199
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,130
that's what it's lets you do very very

200
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,020
useful if you're working with text and

201
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,160
you want to kind of give it that added

202
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,979
dimension and fill in certain areas yeah

203
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,639
that's but all we're going to use

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,889
there's this there's this editor here

205
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,169
you can go use editor you can adjust the

206
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,300
text in here as well and edit it and it

207
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,280
will edit it on here and you can do some

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,320
of these same tools but it's sort of

209
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,030
redundant because you can change it you

210
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,070
can just come in and change it in real

211
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,990
time on here but just know there is an

212
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,289
editor if you prefer to work that way to

213
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,330
change the font well we can select or we

214
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,190
can change the font over here this will

215
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,470
just change all of our font so we click

216
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,050
and there's ways you can choose the way

217
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,610
that this font the way the fonts are

218
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,250
being displayed so you can come over

219
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,950
here and look at it in a grid instead we

220
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,659
can create it larger so we can get a

221
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,089
better view of what these fonts look

222
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,979
like and there's even a breakout if you

223
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,299
do this last one it's kind of nice if

224
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,100
you're working with fonts a lot you can

225
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,130
add over here so that the font selection

226
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,579
comes over here on this side instead so

227
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,910
just like we had our layers was the

228
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,590
we were looking at before now we have a

229
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,100
new window a new font dialog or tool box

230
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,040
just for selecting fonts and browsing

231
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,510
through fonts that are installed on our

232
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,430
system and that's exactly what these are

233
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,530
just fonts installed on the system not

234
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,180
special fonts that come with

235
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,190
necessarily so if a fonts installed in

236
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,660
your system it should be able to get

237
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,200
pulled in and appear in this list okay

238
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,070
this is the last thing I was going to

239
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,080
show you if we grab the brush tool let's

240
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,580
go back to our layers over here and

241
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,390
let's draw if we grab the let's grab a

242
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,850
brush and it's just black right now we

243
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,830
want to draw well first of all we can't

244
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,780
draw over here nothing is happening

245
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,360
because we're on this text layer and

246
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,550
notice this layer has a little a on it

247
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,370
showing us that this is a text layer

248
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,810
which is what lets us be able to get in

249
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,430
here and make changes to it after the

250
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,310
fact we can draw on this so if I wanted

251
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,040
to do some drawing on top of these

252
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,340
letters I can do that but that changed

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,440
this now to I'm not sure what it's

254
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,630
called but it's a different layer it's

255
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,610
not a text layer anymore which means if

256
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,140
I want to come back to the text tool to

257
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,390
make an edit and click in here it's

258
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,590
going to bring up this dialog that says

259
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,990
the layer selected is a text layer but

260
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,330
has not been modified using or has been

261
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,010
modified using other tools so we can

262
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,080
either create a new layer to edit on top

263
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
of this or we can edit it but if we do

264
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,410
we're going to lose or does it say it

265
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,610
basically it'll discard yeah discard all

266
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,440
the modifications we've made so if I go

267
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,900
to edit that's gone now I can edit the

268
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,870
text but all the drawing I did on top of

269
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,540
there is gone so it's a good idea it's a

270
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,810
I recommend just keeping your text

271
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,790
layers as text and then if you want to

272
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,830
draw something go ahead and add in a new

273
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,030
layer and draw on top of that new layer

274
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,560
you can make it a transparent layer oops

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
but that's what I would recommend doing

276
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,590
instead of trying to draw within your

277
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,320
text layers hopefully I found this video

278
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,700
informative I kind of rented that

279
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,830
quickly but we are gonna touch on more

280
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,720
advanced options for making text look

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,540
pretty you can do text a path and you

282
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,890
can do some pretty cool things adding

283
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,320
texture and dimension and 3d text and

284
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,090
all kinds of stuff like that but I'm

285
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,890
going to end this video here go and

286
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,090
leave your questions and comments below

287
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,750
if you have an

288
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,339
and we'll catch you in the next video
