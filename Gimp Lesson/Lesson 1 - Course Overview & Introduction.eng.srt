00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,190
I'm Rendon Rick's with TJ free in this

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,750
tutorial series we'll learn how to use

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,810
the free program to create 2d art

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,780
and photo edit our images if you're not

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,340
familiar with it's a free program

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,349
available for Windows Linux and Mac and

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,420
it's very similar to Adobe Photoshop

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,550
this is a free open-source program

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,779
that's free forever and very

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,939
full-featured and professional in this

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,439
tutorial series we'll learn how to use

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,630
 from a very basic level I'll teach

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,340
you how to install it and then we'll

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,140
learn the basic tools how to create a

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,599
new project how to manage that project

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,279
and export our images in different file

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,040
formats I use just about every day

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,469
to resize images and to do quick little

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,809
edits but I do want to say that there

20
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,890
are some different alternatives

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,300
depending on what you want to do if

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,800
you're interested in digital art you

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,360
should really look into credo

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,640
it's also an open source project that is

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,860
much more geared towards working with

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,350
brushes and kind of recreating the the

27
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,510
aesthetics of fine art and creating art

28
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,850
on a computer I would steer away from

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,680
using for that purpose even though

30
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,359
you can use for creating digital

31
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,670
art also if you're working with raw

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,870
photos or you're working with just

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,970
photography where you're just trying to

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,650
adjust the colors there's a really good

35
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,049
free program called darktable for that

36
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,479
it's similar to Adobe Lightroom and it's

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,610
going to be a very much more powerful

38
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,740
tool than for working with actual

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,710
photos including raw photos but if all

40
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,659
you want to do is some basic edits you

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,250
want to maybe touch-up photos

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,080
 is a great tool for that I've used

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,030
it in the past for repairing tears on

44
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,610
photographs and and maybe taking out

45
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,530
parts of photos where you race a part of

46
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,060
it or you take two different pictures

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,979
and composite them on top of each other

48
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,110
so a lot of great powerful things if you

49
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,210
work a lot in web or you want to like

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,040
quickly design like an ad bar or

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
something imp is a great tool for that

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,509
just an all-around good tool to have so

53
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,860
