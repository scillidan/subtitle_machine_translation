00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,740
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,060
video we're going to be looking at the

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,969
clone and the healing tools these are

4
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,709
really powerful tools in and

5
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:12,209
they're not incredibly difficult to use

6
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:14,009
I'm gonna bring in some images to

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,320
illustrate how these work we can either

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,779
go to file open and I can find them on

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,310
my computer but I'm going to bring in

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,080
three at once I'm going to just navigate

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,640
to the location which is on my desktop

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,830
I'm gonna left click and hold and select

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,710
all three then left click and drag all

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,449
three of them just into this project

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,610
area what that's gonna do is import all

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,260
three of these images and I can toggle

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,240
between which one I'm working on just

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,790
across this top selection bar up here

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,640
and so the first one I want to show is

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,930
the clone tool so this is a picture just

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,940
me standing in the snow and if I wanted

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,350
to use the clone tool I can actually

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,200
clone multiple copies of myself is

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,090
standing here so the clone tool if we

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,370
hover over as the see is the shortcut

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,810
key to select it we found so just

27
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,820
left-click on it and it has a lot of the

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,380
same options that we'd be familiar with

29
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,870
other tools we can change the size of

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,510
the brush the aspect ratio all these

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,120
different things but what we really want

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,950
to do I'm gonna size it to be about the

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,080
size of my leg maybe that's about good

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,210
enough right there and then to use this

35
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,940
tool now does it tell us here what we do

36
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,520
is we hold down the ctrl key and then

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,170
left-click one so I'm gonna hold down

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,120
the ctrl key and left-click at my foot

39
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,340
down here and that creates a dotted

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,610
circle around my foot and now I can

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,070
click anywhere else in the image and my

42
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,260
foot will start to be drawn right there

43
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,909
I'm just left clicking and holding and

44
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,250
it's just redrawing myself here I'll do

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,440
ctrl Z because to make this more

46
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,240
realistic I'll keep that selection there

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
and again to make that selection you

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,500
have to hold the ctrl key and then

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,930
left-click to choose this you're

50
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,760
starting selection and then if I left

51
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
click and hold right here for example I

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,610
can sort of put my foot right here and

53
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,680
just draw this very quickly a clone of

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,080
myself standing in the snow over here

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,750
and the more time I take I can get it

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,180
pretty looking pretty good and with

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,979
notice over on the left hand side it's

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,829
showing me where I'm at on the source I

59
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,990
guess the source part of the image and

60
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,210
then over here I'm just drying so I can

61
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,820
sort of try to make sure I feel like a

62
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,890
feather on this tool right now which

63
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,260
means that the edges are sort of a faded

64
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,240
kind of fade out it's not like a hard

65
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,350
drawn line anyway there we go that's not

66
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,640
too bad so I've got a clone of myself

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,070
and as long as I keep holding down the

68
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,200
mouse the left mouse button I can come

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
over and retouch up any of these areas

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,450
if I unclick the mouse button and then I

71
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,970
try to click again it's going to start

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,060
my source at that same point that I was

73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,240
at so I'll do ctrl Z to undo that that's

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,010
a very quick look at this and you notice

75
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,810
if we zoom in here a little bit we can

76
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,330
see it doesn't look exactly right the

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,130
colors are off a little bit on this side

78
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,440
and that sort of fades into there's some

79
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,230
missing data there kind of but not too

80
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,940
bad for just illustrating how that clone

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,860
tool works a lot of times people will

82
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,440
use this to do face swaps they'll select

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,540
one person's face and then go over to

84
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,820
the next area and an add in you know

85
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,570
replace just the face of a person I want

86
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,060
to show you another tool we can do so we

87
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,350
could do the clone tool you could

88
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,320
imagine erasing a part of an image we

89
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,270
could clone these rocks by holding down

90
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,880
the ctrl key while we're still on the

91
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,190
clone tool and then we could clone

92
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,860
myself out and put some rocks here but

93
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,090
the problem is you get some

94
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,980
strange-looking things so if i zoom in

95
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,440
now it's kind of hard to see here but

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,090
we're really getting you can't really

97
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,910
see all the detail in the rock and

98
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,810
especially with the trees it might look

99
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,610
kind of strange the point that the trees

100
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,620
overlap with each other it just doesn't

101
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,290
look actually it looks pretty good but a

102
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,240
better tool to use in this case is the

103
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,700
healing tool so I'll do ctrl Z the

104
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,170
healing tool is right next to the clone

105
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,630
tool has this band-aid icon on it all I

106
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,580
want to mention your icons may look

107
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,980
different I can mention if the start of

108
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,240
this I'm using a different version of

109
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,340
 so if your icons look different it

110
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,540
doesn't really matter different

111
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,010
operating systems and different versions

112
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,920
display the icons differently

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,420
anyway I'll select this healing tool and

114
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,060
the healing tool works very similarly we

115
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,339
hold down the ctrl key to select an area

116
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm gonna select this area right here

117
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,800
ctrl and then left click and that

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
selects a pattern so this area is the

119
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,070
pattern on

120
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,020
to use and now it behaves the same way

121
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,000
as the clone tool where I can left-click

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,550
and then I can come and just sort of

123
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,740
paint this out one thing I want to be

124
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,120
careful of I should show this with a

125
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
clone tool if I go to the clone tool

126
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
it's a lot more pronounced with the

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,270
clone tool if ever I go too far so if I

128
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,030
start erasing this but I go too far it's

129
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,880
going to start cloning over my mouth

130
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,620
again even though it's not really there

131
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,930
it still remembers that old part of the

132
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,910
image so you have to be careful of where

133
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,340
you set your reference point because if

134
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,230
you're not careful like the sky here if

135
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,570
I start cloning down here and then move

136
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,310
up I'm gonna get the sky at a point I

137
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,260
don't really want it so it always just

138
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,290
stays relative to where you're at I

139
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,460
don't I don't have a touch on the

140
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,410
healing very much but the healing what

141
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,120
it really does is take a pattern and

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,640
then it uses a lot more processing power

143
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,890
so it's a lot slower but it sort of

144
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,430
heals and it sort of it sort of

145
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,840
eliminates that overlap so you don't get

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,270
that look of like part parts of the

147
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,800
images are overlapped if there's a

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,620
pattern background or like grids or

149
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,180
something more complex and it's a solid

150
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,550
color that's a good application to do

151
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,290
the healing but play with healing and

152
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,460
clone and you'll notice a difference

153
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,260
another good example of something we

154
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,320
could do is these clouds if we made ours

155
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,180
the size go down it's really easy to

156
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,790
just get rid of a cloud make this bigger

157
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,460
so if we wanted to we choose this as our

158
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,870
reference point we maybe just go to

159
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,180
clone again for this one and then we can

160
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,240
just kind of erase that cloud but we're

161
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,610
using this background but again if ever

162
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,680
we get into our point if I start erasing

163
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,930
this cloud but I go down it's going to

164
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,950
redraw the cloud lower so just be aware

165
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,350
of how that works if your point is too

166
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,420
close to what you're working with you

167
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,830
may have to select the point and then

168
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,780
you know make sure there's nothing in

169
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,970
the way like this mountain here or we

170
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,220
accidentally dry it up as you play with

171
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,080
that more you'll get more familiar one

172
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,700
more example I want to show you is this

173
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,440
picture here and this is one where the

174
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
healing tool makes a lot of sense this

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,790
is just an old image that has some lines

176
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,890
if I hold down the shift and plus key on

177
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,410
my keyboard I can zoom in here and we

178
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,960
can see these lines where it's like a

179
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,150
fold and like some tears in the image

180
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,030
well we can we could clone directly but

181
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,510
let me come

182
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,660
over here and take the size down a

183
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,510
little bit and then we can grab our

184
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,570
healing tool and we'll select this area

185
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,630
right here hold down ctrl and left click

186
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,150
so this is our target area our source

187
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,460
target and then as I left click here I

188
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,030
can heal oh I forgot this one has an

189
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,130
interesting issue with it this

190
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,600
particular image down here at the bottom

191
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,070
it says healing does not operate on

192
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,290
indexed layers that's because I'm using

193
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,730
a black and white image it doesn't have

194
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,430
a color doesn't have color channels so

195
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,170
if you run into this problem what you

196
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,940
need to do is go to image mode and go to

197
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,640
RGB it's on indexed right now that

198
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,200
doesn't happen often this happened to be

199
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,510
a scanned image and it's black and white

200
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,980
and so for that reason that it's an

201
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,420
indexed mode anyway now I can change

202
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,520
this so I can click here and I can

203
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,460
left-click and erase this tear line I

204
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,790
have an example of this several years

205
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,920
ago in an older version of I'll

206
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,470
show you that now this is repairing an

207
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,200
old image and kind of applying a little

208
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
bit of color adjustment but for the most

209
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,220
part using the healing tool to get rid

210
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,680
of some of the tears and blemishes in

211
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,490
this old kind of battered image well

212
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,330
hopefully you found that informative

213
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,190
guys go ahead and play with the clone

214
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,140
and healing tool there's a lot that you

215
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,590
can do between between getting rid of

216
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,680
things on an image and repairing parts

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,900
of images and even just cloning over

218
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,820
there's quite a bit you can do with just

219
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,510
these without ever having to dive into

220
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,350
selection which we're going to cover in

221
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,390
future videos and some of these more

222
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,370
advanced techniques go ahead and leave

223
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,420
