00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,120
video we're going to be playing with the

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,189
Dodge and burn and these smudge tools

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,929
and learning about some of the different

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,249
options getting a little bit more

6
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:13,079
familiar with using these tools and

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,909
we're going to be working with an actual

8
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,500
photograph this time so I'm gonna go to

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,990
file and go to open you can choose any

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,269
photograph I'm just navigated to some

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,339
pictures that I have here on my computer

12
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,339
and so yours will be different but I'm

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,589
going to select this image here and one

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,939
common thing that's going to happen when

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,679
you go to open an image is sometimes

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,650
it'll be a different color profile this

17
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,030
really doesn't matter at this point in

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,770
time you can either say keep or convert

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
this is just saying this has an sRGB

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,080
color profile and it's wondering if I'd

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,810
like to use the built-in srgb and

22
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,590
so I'm just gonna say keep in this case

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,910
sometimes you may want to convert but

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,770
don't worry about that for now it's just

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,590
how interprets the colors in the

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,180
image

27
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,540
so this is I think in darktable earlier

28
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,730
this is a kind of an edited photo but

29
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,199
we'll play with a smudge tool if we left

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,570
click on smudge like the shortcut is s

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,480
to access this tool and it's very very

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,130
small right now so I may bring up the

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,260
size by just using my scroll wheel or

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,420
left clicking and dragging up this size

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,490
to get to something larger and we can

36
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,230
see what the smudge will let us do if i

37
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,720
zoom in here it'll just sort of smudge

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,720
and soften up these clouds quite a bit

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,150
actually I can kind of mix its you can

40
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,250
almost imagine the ink of this picture

41
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,310
is still wet and so I'm just smudging it

42
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,070
I'm smudging these clouds I'm just left

43
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,409
clicking and holding to create sort of

44
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,650
this smudge so you can by hand sort of

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,380
come in here and create a different kind

46
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,350
of effect I suppose you could smudge out

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,290
all the edges to create sort of a little

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,930
vignette a little smudge vignette in or

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,510
something around the image if ever we

50
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,860
get to a point again that we don't

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,180
really like what we've done we can hit

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,270
ctrl Z on the keyboard to undo some of

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,450
that there's also some other options we

54
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,940
can play with besides just size and we

55
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,380
haven't really done much of these but we

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,810
have aspect ratio which is going to be

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,430
more of like we can make our brush size

58
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,950
a more oval like

59
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,330
if we're trying to fit it in a certain

60
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,790
area we can adjust the angle so now we

61
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,680
have this an oval here that's sort of at

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,580
an angle so we can play with those and

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,660
we've learned in the past we can just

64
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,459
click this button here to reset these

65
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,260
back to default if we don't like what

66
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
we've done we don't like the changes

67
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,070
that we've made to the brush itself and

68
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,709
then but these are all similar if you

69
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,570
notice if we went to the pencil tool or

70
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,459
the brush tool these all have the same

71
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,660
option size angle aspect ratio so smudge

72
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,340
is going to have those same options but

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,410
it also has some different options down

74
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,650
below we have this apply jitter which

75
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,690
will kind of randomly it doesn't make a

76
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,540
big difference in this case but you we

77
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,100
can we can turn this up any time you're

78
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,900
not sure what something does I'll turn

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,910
the amount way up and see if I notice a

80
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,100
difference so in this case can you see

81
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
what's happening as I do this it's

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,060
creating these dots all over it's kind

83
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,630
of a jitter outside of even my brush and

84
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,190
so you turn that down

85
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
but the jitter just sort of applies it

86
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,660
instead of doing it at one location it

87
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,239
sort of randomly applies it around and

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,980
again this is the smudge tool but

89
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,049
different tools have a jitter as well we

90
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,130
can apply it to different things let's

91
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,630
look at the dodging burn so if we go I

92
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,790
mean ctrl Z and undo some of that that I

93
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,980
did there and oh I want to show you one

94
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,230
other way to to bring an image in maybe

95
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,549
we want to close this we can click this

96
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,100
X up here and just say discard changes

97
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,530
so we won't save any of that we can also

98
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,780
navigate to a location on our computer

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,390
I'll go to these same images and I'll

100
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,450
just drag in this image here we'll

101
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,519
left-click and drag it into and

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,890
again we can either keep or convert this

103
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,260
time I guess I'll say convert and so we

104
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,390
have this image and we can do this Dodge

105
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,519
and burn if we select the Dodge and burn

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,950
tool it's shift D is the shortcut to

107
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,230
access the Dodge and burn tool and what

108
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,630
this does burn kind of it effects the

109
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,030
colors of the image so right now we have

110
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,829
it set to if we scroll down we have it

111
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,280
set to Dodge and and so Dodge is going

112
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,260
to kind of lighten lighten up the colors

113
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,940
in a certain area so maybe I could

114
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,310
whiten my teeth with this in a way but

115
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,750
it's also getting my lips a little bit

116
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,060
and the more you click it the more it

117
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,430
kind of applies it on top of the

118
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,260
existing changes

119
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,550
Bern is gonna be the opposite so if we

120
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,010
select burn down here Bern kind of makes

121
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,139
the colors more dark whatever's in that

122
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,479
area it makes it darker and more

123
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,669
pronounced I can make my ear darker make

124
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,699
my teeth darker so I kind of just bring

125
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,949
it kind of lightens up or darkens up the

126
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,720
area look at that you can like make look

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,919
like I haven't wearing makeup or

128
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,050
something yeah

129
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,030
so that's Dodge and burn and there's

130
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,380
different options right now we did we

131
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,540
did it adjusting the mid-tones we could

132
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,370
do the highlights which is gonna kind of

133
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,410
darken anything part that has highlights

134
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,270
I probably showed it on the teeth and we

135
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,880
control Z I could probably do teeth a

136
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,530
little bit more realistically with doing

137
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,630
the highlights and if I adjust the size

138
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,720
of my brush I could probably achieve

139
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,729
some sort of a oh and then I need to

140
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,690
change it to Dodge instead of burn so

141
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,280
we'll do Dodge here so it's gonna

142
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,020
lighten my teeth a little bit but it

143
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,720
keeps the colors so I kind of keeps some

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,430
of the natural looking colors of my

145
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,560
teeth but it kind of whitens it a little

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,830
bit in there too so I don't know that's

147
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,050
super not realistic looking but this is

148
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,190
probably not the tool you would use for

149
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,470
a teeth enhancement anyway or eyes I can

150
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,479
lighten up the way my eyes are appearing

151
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,820
in here if I want to so anyway that's

152
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,680
Dodge and burn and yeah that's really

153
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,270
what we're gonna cover today so play

154
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,039
with smudge play with Dodge and burn but

155
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,860
just kind of realize everything we've

156
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,570
looked at so far the eraser that brush

157
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,880
the pencil dodge burn the settings are

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,490
all very similar that they have it's all

159
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,340
these brush settings and then down below

160
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,169
it kind of has some specific settings

161
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,680
more specific to that tool that we're

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,449
using hopefully you found this video

163
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,800
informative go ahead and play with those

164
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
and the next video will look at some

165
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,580
more tools and continue learning about

166
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,030
