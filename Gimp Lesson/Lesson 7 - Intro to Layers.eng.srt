00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,330
video we'll learn about the basics of

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,910
layers within there's a couple

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,990
different things to know about layers

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,289
one is we can use layers across the top

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,909
menu bar here we can create a new layer

7
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,560
and there's some different options for

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,150
layers we can delete or duplicate a

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,099
layer and then the way that we interact

10
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,929
with these layers is over here towards

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,480
the right-hand side and right now we see

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,609
we have one layer called background now

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,019
if you're not seeing this or if it's not

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,029
called background for example if this is

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,589
close if we don't have a document our

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,870
layers appears empty because we have no

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,300
layer because we have no project but if

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,980
we open up an image maybe I'll just open

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,960
an image for a good example we'll choose

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,000
an image and we'll open it up just a

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,060
regular JPEG image and now we see the

22
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,520
name of the image and it is also our

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,190
layer we can change the name by just

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,600
double-clicking in here and we can call

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
this guy and so this is like the the guy

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,540
layer but the reason layers are nice is

27
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,200
because let's say we wanted to draw we

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,250
want that like circle this guy well if

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,900
we want if we draw the circle and then

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,550
later on we get doing something else we

31
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,320
adjust the colors and we want to move

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
change this circle a little bit we've

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,370
learned in the past we could kind of

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,280
select there's different options but

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,170
really since it's all on the same layer

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,390
what we've done is we've drawn we've

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,659
changed the pixels underneath this to

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,060
black they're all just black now so if

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,470
we want to move it we can grab the move

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,120
tool but what we're going to end up

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,090
doing is moving the circle and the image

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,880
together and if that's not what we want

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,400
to do what we could do is I'll do ctrl Z

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,120
a bunch of times

45
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,670
we can come over here and go layer new

46
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,070
layer or I can right click in this area

47
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,680
and just go to new layer and it brings

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,440
up this dialog to create a new layer so

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,060
I'll call this layer circle I was doing

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,650
this earlier which is why that populated

51
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,240
with that I'll leave everything else the

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,650
same and hit OK

53
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,680
so now I have this circle layer and it

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,570
has a little white highlight around it

55
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,159
that's telling me that that is the layer

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm on not the guy layer last time when

57
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,320
I drew the circle I was on the guy layer

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,818
so I'm going to click on this circle

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,008
layer and now I'm going to go into dry

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,209
circle

61
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,840
just like last time and now if I want to

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,930
move it'll just move the circle what

63
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,060
it's really doing is moving everything

64
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,239
on this layer and we could do we can

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,129
grab like the resize at the scale tool

66
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,319
and we can scale and change the size of

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,090
this circle but again what we're really

68
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,310
doing is changing the scale of

69
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,590
everything on this layer and by that I

70
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,810
mean if I if I had something else drawn

71
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,980
over here and I wanted to do let me

72
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,959
point like an arrow or something well if

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,569
we go to move now it's going to move the

74
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,909
circle but we can't select just the

75
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,560
circle and move it separately without

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
moving this arrow and also this I can

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,659
also come over here to just the layer of

78
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,760
the guy or just the layer of the entire

79
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,340
image and I can move the entire image

80
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,489
around now keeping these everything else

81
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,819
is drawn on the other layer intact now

82
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,169
if I'm going to drag it right here we

83
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,180
see these dots these a sort of squares

84
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,769
here we've looked at a little bit in the

85
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:11,909
past this just shows that this is

86
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,980
transparency so when this image is

87
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,780
actually rendered out and let's just do

88
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,680
it right now and see what it would look

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,190
like if we go to export as and I'll call

90
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,639
it test and put it on the desktop we can

91
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,169
see what this image will look like I'll

92
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,129
just export it so this image looks like

93
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,430
this now it has white up here because it

94
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,260
was transparent and it just defaulted to

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,239
white and it cut off the bottom of that

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,549
but it still has both these layers but

97
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,949
now everything is all just together it's

98
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,959
just a collection of pixels I can't edit

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,819
these layers I can't move this arrow or

100
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,620
the circle independently it's all just

101
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,509
one flattened image that's called like

102
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,030
flattened when you do that but in here I

103
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,949
still can do that but I want to show you

104
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,199
what that transparency looks like also

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,939
over here we have these little eyes so

106
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,609
we can turn off just this layer and keep

107
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,079
looking at this layer maybe it's

108
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,970
distracting us we want to just draw and

109
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,790
then turn this on it's still there it's

110
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,079
not deleted or anything it's just

111
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,879
toggling whether it's viewable or not

112
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,489
the eye when the eyes closed or off it's

113
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,349
not viewable and when it's open it is

114
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,629
viewable we can turn off the drawing

115
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,940
part too and we could bring in another

116
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,259
layer if we wanted we can right-click

117
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,048
and go new layer we can just call this

118
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,639
one whatever we want to

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,409
and now we have this different type of

120
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,810
this different layer here and maybe I'll

121
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,389
do something well watch this if we grab

122
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,300
the smudge tool and I try to apply

123
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,610
smudge here or we try to do the clone

124
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,620
tool and we try to clone different parts

125
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,189
nothing's happening that's because we're

126
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,889
referencing nothing the the layer were

127
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,949
on is this so if I turn off these this

128
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,020
is what we're really seeing so we're

129
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,969
cloning but we're cloning transparency

130
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,189
into transparency and when we grab the

131
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:56,469
smudge tool we're smudging transparency

132
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:58,479
and when we grab the move tool we're

133
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,719
moving transparency so and that really

134
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,129
is actually looks like it is moving the

135
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,409
the layer you can layer because the

136
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,750
layer is the same size it has attributes

137
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,289
too but what I want to show with that is

138
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,419
if we have everything turned on and

139
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,340
let's take this one and let's just fill

140
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,740
it with a color so that the transparency

141
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,750
is not throwing us off let's fill it

142
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,680
with red and now it fills everything but

143
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,479
the black still there but the picture is

144
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,939
gone right now this guy image is at the

145
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,740
very bottom which is why we can't see it

146
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,509
if we left click and drag it to the

147
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,229
middle it's kind of above the red but

148
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,440
it's behind the this circle that's why

149
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,599
the circles on top but the red is behind

150
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,940
the image and if we drag this on top

151
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,969
then we just see the image well it's

152
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,469
dragged down so we see a little bit

153
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:48,759
differently but we can't see those black

154
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,520
arrows on top let's say we grab this red

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,740
layer it's just solid red and drag it on

156
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,379
top well now we only see red so whatever

157
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,710
is on top is what you see first and then

158
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,960
if there's any gaps or transparency like

159
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,979
those squares you'll see it behind that

160
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,870
make sense so if we were to turn this

161
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,580
off this red we see the transparency

162
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,620
what's really there which is nothing

163
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,689
transparent unless something's in its

164
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,360
way and then it appears there this is a

165
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,089
basic introduction there's a lot more

166
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,259
that we're gonna get into with layers

167
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,180
but go ahead and play with these for now

168
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,339
toggling viewing it and then toggling

169
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,900
when you're selected on the layer and

170
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,939
just know when you have a certain tool

171
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,279
selected like move make sure that you're

172
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,379
moving the layer you can hover over and

173
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,839
move the layer and not the selection

174
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,339
because you can also move the selection

175
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,540
like we learned about previously

176
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,910
and that just moves what is selected it

177
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,460
doesn't really move the lair this one

178
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,310
you can either pick a lair to move so

179
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,220
whatever lair you click on will move or

180
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,580
if you say move active layer it'll move

181
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,190
whatever layer is selected but always

182
