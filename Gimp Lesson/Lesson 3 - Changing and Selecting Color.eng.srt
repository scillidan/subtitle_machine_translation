00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,740
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,900
video we'll quickly look at color and

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,999
picking color choosing a certain color

4
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:11,369
that we want to use in we'll look

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,780
at the different options we have for the

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,519
color interface and different ways to

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,310
pick a color and then we will be using

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,009
color if you don't already have a blank

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,570
document you can just get one by going

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,119
to file new and then just leave

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,339
everything to default and hit OK and it

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,839
brings up a nice blank square like this

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,999
so we have a nice square white canvas

14
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,949
one thing I will say is that we do not

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,080
have an alpha channel if we go over here

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,420
to the top right we can look and see we

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,730
have a red green and a blue channel and

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,520
if we click on our layers we see we just

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,710
have one layer don't you don't need to

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,940
worry about any of this if it doesn't

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,530
make any sense to you but just know that

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,900
we do not have transparency which is why

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,700
if we go to our eraser and try and erase

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,280
this white we can't get to a transparent

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,250
background like we could if we had at a

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,530
alpha channel so for alpha channel if I

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,940
right click and go add alpha Channel

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,370
now we could erase and these sort of

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,010
squares back here is transparency or

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,320
like the Alpha Channel don't worry about

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,760
that at all I'm gonna remove it right

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,190
now because we'll touch on that later in

33
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,480
the future but just know that's why

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,670
we're not gonna see options when we left

35
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,920
click on our color to choose we can

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
choose a color but we're not gonna see

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,640
options for the Alpha channel or for

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,820
transparency in here just yet anyway

39
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,760
okay so let's slow down a little bit and

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,590
go over here to choose our color we've

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,170
learned before if we start drawing if we

42
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,450
go back to select a black color we can

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,520
just draw with our brush or the pencil

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,770
or lots of these different tools and we

45
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,650
can draw in black to change the color we

46
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,750
just left-click on one of these two

47
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,130
squares either the white or the black

48
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,170
the one that's on top is the one we're

49
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,510
using right now which is to black and we

50
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,670
can select any shade of red in here we

51
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,620
can go in the top right hand corner is

52
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,830
pure red we can hit OK and now

53
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,310
everything we draw will be in red we can

54
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,920
come again and left-click and we can go

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,810
over and if we left click on hold we

56
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,119
kind of get these crosshairs and we can

57
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,158
see it's moving the dials around over

58
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:10,258
here a little bit this might be

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,569
different for you might be this LCH i

60
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,099
have it selected on this

61
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,920
HSV and it's just changing different

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,930
ways it's got a red green and a blue

63
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,540
channel we can also change the color

64
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,909
over here but I would recommend staying

65
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,499
away from this when you're just starting

66
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:28,349
out and only change your color over here

67
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,260
on the left side portion so to change

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,659
the actual color we can select with left

69
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,849
clicking we can go to our blues we can

70
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,730
go to more like yellows or Red's we can

71
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,230
left-click and hold and see how that

72
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,349
changes and when we get the the color or

73
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,989
the hue that we want we can then select

74
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,680
mixing white with that or more blue and

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,349
under current it shows the color that

76
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,659
we're currently on so we did have this

77
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,909
red color so it's the old and now we're

78
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,829
going to be more of a blue and if we

79
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,209
want to be more of a blue mixed with

80
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,579
white we come up here and this is kind

81
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,199
of a halfway between blue and white we

82
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,079
hit OK and we have sort of this blue

83
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,349
white color now another tool we haven't

84
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,579
really looked at is the bucket filled

85
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,409
tool so maybe if I choose a different

86
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,879
color like this green and we get a

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,030
really pale green color hit OK we can go

88
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,120
to the bucket fill tool or the what's it

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,009
called fill tool yeah bucket fill tool

90
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,620
we left click on it and now we can click

91
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,389
and it'll fill in everything within that

92
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,359
area will be that color so maybe we want

93
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,970
these eyes to be a purple color with

94
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,159
some black mixed in like a black purpley

95
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,109
we can select that color and go to okay

96
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,840
and we can fill in these eyes now so it

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,090
fills in the whole area so now we've

98
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,519
drawn a little face right here there's a

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,680
toggle too if we want so if we grab the

100
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,900
eraser tool right now and we start to

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,599
erase it's going to erase this back this

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,299
color here so not the purple you erase

103
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,680
this cover that's behind which is a

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,019
white square right now so if we erase

105
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,819
everything is erasing in white but it

106
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,530
doesn't have to be that way we can

107
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,810
change the erase color by clicking on

108
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,699
that one and change it to a different

109
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,129
color as well maybe we change it to a

110
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,189
shade of red and it okay so now when we

111
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,009
erase it'll be this shade of darker you

112
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,589
know maroon red color and we can toggle

113
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,199
between the two if we click this button

114
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,298
now the foreground color is this sort of

115
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,240
maroon and the background color or the

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,949
color of our erase tool will be this

117
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,200
purple this darker purple

118
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,380
when we have our drawing tool selected

119
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,420
like the brush we can do that too we can

120
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,610
draw let's change the color of this to

121
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,520
more of a open somes in contrasting more

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
of a green so now we have a green right

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,530
here and if we want to just toggle

124
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,030
between the two we can left-click and

125
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,460
now we have the purple so play with that

126
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,560
toggling between the two it's also X is

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,600
the shortcut key if you hover over it

128
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,270
tells you press X and you can toggle see

129
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,060
we can draw a line press X and keep

130
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,980
toggling between those two by pressing X

131
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,990
on our keyboard monster on my keyboard

132
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,740
shortcuts real quick so X will toggle

133
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,120
that okay let's go back into the colors

134
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,020
now so I want to show you some different

135
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,180
options we have so we've just looked at

136
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,500
this one right here if we hover over

137
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,230
this is what's called the the color

138
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,450
selector if we right click we see what

139
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,840
they all are we have CMYK we have

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
water color we have wheel and we have

141
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,660
palette and that's right clicking to get

142
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,100
to those options or we can click these

143
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,810
tiny little icons once you get familiar

144
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,060
with them you can just click on them so

145
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,260
CMYK is cyan magenta yellow and K is the

146
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,390
black color so you can choose your color

147
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,400
this way you can choose this is done in

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
printing a lot you can choose by mixing

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,290
these different colors and you create a

150
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,430
color so we've created this sort of

151
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,160
orange color and again as we move these

152
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,260
it's changing the dials over here under

153
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,660
the red green blue and the hue

154
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,540
saturation and value is what this HSB

155
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,450
stands for so we can choose our color

156
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,430
this way and we can hit OK and now we've

157
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,229
got a nice color for printing that a

158
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,270
printer can interpret it knows how to

159
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,790
make this ugly brownish color and if we

160
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,100
add more cyan which is like a bluish

161
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,650
color and take out the magenta which is

162
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,660
more like a red and take out the yellow

163
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,690
we're gonna get just cyan so this is

164
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,190
just a cyan color now okay let's go back

165
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,900
and see what else we have we have this

166
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,169
watercolor and watercolors one I'm

167
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,270
actually not quite sure if it's working

168
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,740
correctly in this version but it's one

169
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,419
that I don't use anyway you can select

170
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,400
colors in watercolor but one that I do

171
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,470
use a lot is this color wheel this next

172
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,090
one the color wheel that you choose

173
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,980
between white in one

174
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,800
corner black in the other corner and

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,080
then full color saturation in that other

176
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,390
corner and you can mix between any of

177
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,420
those colors to create a nice color and

178
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,400
then if you want to change the hue of

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,250
the color you come around and you can

180
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,800
left-click in this circle to find a nice

181
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,170
hue and then a mix between either white

182
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,700
and black or white and that color or

183
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,640
black in that color so this is a good a

184
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,170
good way to pick colors as well you can

185
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,270
pick the same colors in this in all

186
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,370
different methods you can pick the same

187
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,200
colors it's just a different interface

188
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,590
for how you want to pick the last thing

189
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,510
we have here is our palette so this is

190
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,920
the colors that we've used in the past

191
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,870
if you want to quickly jump back to that

192
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,180
ugly brown color we can do that or this

193
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,610
kind of this magenta color we had picked

194
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,070
earlier or some of these lighter green

195
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,020
so it keeps a history of the palette

196
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,790
you're using so you can jump back and

197
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,980
forth between certain colors one last

198
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,660
thing I want to talk about is if we do

199
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,880
change over here if we want to change

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,640
the value of the red green and blue you

201
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,250
can toggle between 0 and 100 showing

202
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,310
that or 0 and 255 a lot of times if

203
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,350
you're working with color especially in

204
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,990
like HTML or different in like websites

205
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,700
and things you might want to have a

206
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,000
value between 0 and 255 so in that case

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,210
when you do maximum red it's 255 and

208
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,900
minimum is 0 but some people don't work

209
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,670
in web or maybe especially if you're

210
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,610
working in like CMYK and light color you

211
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,400
maybe want to do between 0 and 100 it's

212
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,840
just personal preference but then that

213
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,030
way when you turn up red to the full

214
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,480
amount it's 100% and so you know 50 is

215
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,600
50% it kind of helps you understand if

216
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,700
you have 25% of a certain color or not

217
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
anyway that's kind of the different

218
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,549
toggles we have there one last thing

219
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,349
I'll show you is we can select this here

220
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,599
which is the eyedropper tool so we can

221
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,970
pick a certain color from our image like

222
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,130
this black and then we can choose that

223
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,770
color or we can pick this purple color

224
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,570
that we had before this is especially

225
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,040
useful if you have an actual image

226
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,540
brought in that you're working on like a

227
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,630
photograph you can pick a certain pixel

228
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,570
color from that image and know exactly

229
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,200
what that

230
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,010
is and be able to use it as well so

231
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,670
hopefully that's made a little bit of

232
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,680
sense go ahead and play with this the

233
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,720
color different color options we have

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,670
here I will say there's also a color

235
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,829
picker tool as well right here if we

236
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:11,649
hover over we can pick a color this way

237
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,389
as well and just start using that color

238
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,760
so now we have this red we can click on

239
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,329
the color picker and we can pick this

240
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,459
blue color and then we can draw in that

241
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,000
as well

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,380
so that's another way to pick colors

243
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,560
from the image you're working with well

244
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm gonna leave this video here go ahead

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,959
and leave questions or comments below if

246
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,760
you have any and I'll catch you in the

247
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,389
next video
