00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,800
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,570
video we'll be learning about the move

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,480
and also the crop tool so crop is a

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,459
fancy word for cut it's the way that we

5
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,469
would cut out a certain area like this

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,780
and then it selects that we hit enter

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
and now we've cut kind of the outside of

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,099
our image away and then move as you know

9
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:23,279
is just going to move our image or we

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,990
can move parts of the image as well so

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,509
we learn how to do that I do in control

12
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:28,679
Z to get this back to where it was

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,369
originally

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,019
so let's slow down and go over these one

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,820
at a time let's do the crop first

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,130
there's a couple ways to do crop when we

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,050
select the crop tool it's shift to see

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,700
is the shortcut and the icon looks like

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,710
this and again these icons may be in a

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,600
different location for you if you're

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,310
depending on how your dialog is sized

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,350
and also what version of you're

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,820
using the icons may even look different

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,690
but find your crop tool and then to use

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,550
it we just left-click and hold the mouse

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,980
down the left mouse button and when we

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,740
unclick it shades out the area that will

28
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,200
be cut out and it keeps highlighted the

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,170
area that is going to be remaining and

30
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,030
then we hit the enter key on our

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,370
keyboard and it performs that cut if we

32
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,170
don't like it we can go control Z and

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,020
just go back and we can redraw or a

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,600
better way is to just use these handles

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,850
here before we hit Enter we can use

36
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,010
these handles to sort of fine-tune and

37
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,620
really crop into the area that we want

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,110
we can also click on the corners and

39
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,420
resize this is sort of similar to the

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,760
way we drew selections where when we

41
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,430
resize one corner is fixed and a

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,080
shortcut we didn't really go over is if

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,990
we hold down the ctrl key while we're in

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,350
the selection resize mode we can resize

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,630
from based off of the center so I'm

46
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,100
holding down the ctrl key right now

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,010
rather than having a fixed point also

48
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,870
what you might try is holding down the

49
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,909
shift key and that'll let us scale

50
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,850
uniformly so even if I come down here

51
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,820
and try and go just over to the right

52
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,530
any distance I go horizontally will also

53
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,140
go vertically when the shift key is held

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,630
while in this resize mode that make

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,970
sense I'm gonna hit enter to confirm

56
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,508
this crop the move tool we've used in

57
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,729
the past when the move tool selected

58
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,860
it'll move either the layer we

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,450
can also tell it to move the selection

60
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,580
or the path based on these different

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,590
modes over here but make sure you're on

62
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,110
this move by layer and then right now

63
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,580
it's just picking the active layer so

64
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,320
whatever layer I click on will move I

65
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,440
only have one layer right now but to

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,940
illustrate is a little bit better let's

67
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,310
bring in a new image and keep this one

68
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,740
here so I'll go file open and I'll

69
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,140
select this image right here so now I

70
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
have two different projects I can see up

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,190
top here there's this one of me standing

72
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,320
in the snow this is actually my brother

73
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,410
here and so I can copy this image of my

74
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,500
brother by going to right click and edit

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,090
and go to copy or I can press ctrl C on

76
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,160
the keyboard and that's now copied to

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,320
the clipboard this image then I can go

78
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
over to the other image and go control V

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,880
on my keyboard to paste it or I can

80
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,920
right click and go to edit and go to

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,320
paste and that will paste this image

82
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,390
well now I can click on the move tool

83
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,080
and I can move this image around it's

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,300
actually a layer if you notice over here

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,580
it's a floating selection it's a

86
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,100
separate layer from this image so it's

87
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,269
kind of like there's two layers right

88
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,880
now we can do two things we can choose

89
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,940
to merge this as part of this image and

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,790
combine them into one layer to do that

91
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,280
we just right click over here and go to

92
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,299
anchor layer now it's anchored in there

93
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,440
and if we try to move it

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,530
it'll everything will move together any

95
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,880
scaling or anything we apply is going to

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,940
move all these together I can go ctrl Z

97
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,100
and get back to that point before I did

98
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,200
the merge because we can also right

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,950
click and go to new layer and what that

100
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,110
does it puts this floating selection on

101
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,320
its own new layer now we have two layers

102
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,290
we can click and see each one

103
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,480
individually and this lets us be able to

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,290
still move this around we can crop just

105
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,269
this image or just do either one of

106
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,739
these images independently from the

107
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,780
other if we do the crop tool right now

108
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,970
and we want to crop in just a part of

109
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,649
this image but keep everything out here

110
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,750
unaffected we don't do it this way if we

111
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,608
do it'll just crop in like this

112
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,550
but I can go ctrl Z and before I select

113
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,229
the crop notice there's some options

114
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,060
under crop as well there's one called

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,720
current

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,050
lair only if I check that and then draw

117
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,590
my crop selection and then hit enter it

118
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,750
will only crop just the layer that I'm

119
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,500
working on does that make sense and so

120
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,720
if we didn't have that selected then it

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,130
would treat everything as one and crop

122
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,280
all layers together there's also some

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
other options here and we'll play with

124
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,610
more of these in the future we can silk

125
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,890
we can instead of drawing this we could

126
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,690
draw and then we could fine tune it over

127
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,970
here and change the size notice as I

128
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,060
click these it's moving subtly the size

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,280
of it and we can also use our scroll

130
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,470
wheel to change that as well there is

131
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,970
one more way to crop I want to show you

132
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,040
and that is just by using the selection

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
tool so we can select an area and it

134
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,110
looks similar to crop only notice when

135
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,240
the selection tool is used it doesn't

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,290
everything else doesn't get grayed out

137
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,640
and if we hit enter

138
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,710
it doesn't crop or do anything so the

139
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,090
selection tool even though the interface

140
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,400
sort of looks the same and we can resize

141
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,880
it it's not the crop tool so pay

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
attention to that but what this will let

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,940
us do is when we have a selection we can

144
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,370
crop to that selection all we have to do

145
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,480
is click on image and go to crop to

146
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,820
selection and that will crop to whatever

147
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,860
we have selected we talked about that a

148
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,300
little bit in the past like if we were

149
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,580
to do a circle selection and we want to

150
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,040
crop to a circle it'll still do it as a

151
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,550
square we can go image crop to selection

152
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,040
and that'll kind of crop that out so

153
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,810
some ways we'll learn how we could cut

154
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,640
out if we wanted to have transparency in

155
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,919
the corners there but just know you can

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,770
crop that way as well by cropping to

157
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,210
whatever you have selected but it'll

158
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,460
still always crop in a square or

159
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,350
rectangle well hopefully you found this

160
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,600
informative go ahead and play with crop

161
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,820
and play with move and the next videos

162
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,020
we're going to be doing some more of

163
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,810
this where we copy certain images and

164
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,700
paste them we'll be playing with rotate

165
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,620
and shear and learning how to composite

166
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,900
multiple images together appreciate you

167
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,190
watching leave your questions comments

168
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,540
below and I'll catch you in the next

169
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,750
video
