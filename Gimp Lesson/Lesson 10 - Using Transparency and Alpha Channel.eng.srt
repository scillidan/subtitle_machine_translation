00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,240
video we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,429
transparency and the Alpha Channel in

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,820
 so transparency lets us erase and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,369
not see any pixels not white not black

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,060
just a clear transparent pixel so if we

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,230
want to do that now we've learned in the

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,179
past if we clicked on the erase tool and

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,099
we left click and hold it will erase

10
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,439
parts of our image well right now this

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,689
image does not have an alpha Channel

12
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,509
which means it's only going to do solid

13
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:32,250
pixels or solid

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,770
yeah.well solid pixels even white is a

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,020
solid pixel what I mean by that is if

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,910
we're if we were to erase this corner

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,030
right here and then export this image we

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,910
would see it just like we do now so this

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,130
part that we erased wouldn't be clear it

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,660
wouldn't be like glass like showing

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,030
through to what's behind it like it

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,280
would be I downloaded the icon

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,170
right here so the icon has

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,060
transparency we can tell that because it

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,250
has this checker pattern this is sort of

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,290
the the way that you can see if

27
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,420
something is transparent or not so this

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,040
is telling us everywhere where we can

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,180
see a pixel where we can see a color or

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,070
we can see the outline of this we know

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,560
that the actual image is there but

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,390
everywhere where it shows these squares

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,940
this checker pattern that's basically

34
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,360
clear or glass or transparency and

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,890
that's why when we zoom in here to this

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,500
actual icon we are we look at it on the

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,240
desktop and we see as we move it around

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,000
see it we can see it it's green

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
background over here now and over here

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,350
we can if we drag it over top of another

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,470
icon it's transparent so this real image

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,470
is actually a complete square image like

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,799
this but we're only seeing this shape

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,270
and a lot of times people get confused

45
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,560
when they're first starting out with

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,210
 because they want to create a

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,280
circle or something well that's how you

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,979
do it is you have to have transparency

49
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,780
so to get transparency right now we're

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,000
erasing but we're getting white we might

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,159
as well be just draw like painting white

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,650
on top of this it's kind of the same as

53
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,049
erasing through to white it's kind of

54
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,360
hard to tell a difference so I'm gonna

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,549
hit control Z a couple of times to add

56
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,318
an alpha channel we can look over here

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,689
sometimes you can have a separate

58
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,459
background

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,170
but the easiest way to do this is to

60
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,489
just come over here in this area and

61
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,829
right-click and then go down to add

62
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,739
alpha channel and what that's going to

63
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,569
do we don't notice any changes right

64
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,689
away but when we try to erase now we see

65
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,140
it's not white we see we're erasing true

66
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,780
into that true transparency I can erase

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,459
parts of my face I can erase whatever I

68
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,340
want so let's try and do some erasing

69
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,470
here real quick let me make my brush a

70
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,299
little bit larger and I'm just going to

71
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,359
erase kind of quickly some of the

72
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,980
background here looks like I got part of

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,000
myself that's okay

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,970
and I'll go file export because I want

75
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,290
to show you when you're exporting with

76
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,060
transparency it's also important that

77
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,099
you save the file as a PNG and not a

78
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,790
JPEG a jpg file if we did a jpg I'll

79
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,379
just show you what'll happen so we have

80
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,299
test jpg we'll export that to the

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,340
desktop and we'll go and take a look at

82
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,040
it and see what this looks like so it

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,329
did not do it still showed it as white

84
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,889
so this looks different than what we had

85
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,700
we thought we were going to have

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,220
transparency there but really it showed

87
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,479
up as white in our photo viewer and more

88
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,159
importantly on the desktop when we try

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,169
to zoom in and do what we did with the

90
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,479
 icon we can't do it with this one

91
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,319
we just see these white corners so let's

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,609
go back and let's do it the right way

93
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,069
which is to go to file and we go to

94
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,620
export as and then we change these last

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,030
three letters to P n G it's just a

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,769
different file format it processes the

97
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,870
image different and PNG supports

98
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,000
transparent background there are

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,889
versions of there's ways you can have a

100
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,049
transparent background with a JPEG but

101
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,879
the best thing to do is just always get

102
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,979
in the habit of exporting in a PNG file

103
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,930
notice it's taking a little bit longer

104
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,849
to export let's take a look here and see

105
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,169
some of the differences between these

106
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,810
two so now we see this one is looking

107
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,639
kind of weird I can zoom in a little bit

108
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,250
it's gonna be a little bit grainy but we

109
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,349
see this image doesn't have that white

110
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,629
it's sort of strange sort of a strange

111
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,389
image to make but that's the difference

112
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,759
between the two we have a jpg and a PNG

113
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,880
and let's right-click and go to I'll go

114
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
to properties on this one this one is

115
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,930
348

116
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,300
kilobytes this one if we go to

117
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,820
properties this one is 2 megabytes so

118
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,590
the JPEG is gonna be is going to be

119
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,570
smaller because it doesn't have as much

120
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,700
detail it's just white and then this one

121
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,080
has the transparency but it also

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,850
processes it processes the pixels a

123
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,740
little bit differently so this is about

124
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,980
five times larger than this then the

125
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,780
same image and there's ways we can

126
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,850
optimize that as well but just be aware

127
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,950
when you're working in transparency when

128
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,660
you add an alpha channel to an image it

129
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,139
is going to increase the size ok let's

130
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,270
go to let's look at another way that we

131
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,100
could get an image if we erase we've

132
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,229
closed out of this if we want to start

133
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,660
we go to file new we want to create a

134
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,840
document with a transparent background

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,260
to start with well if we go 1920 by 1080

136
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,990
and we go ok it creates oh this one did

137
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,130
it for us but that's because I was

138
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,530
playing with it earlier for you go to

139
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,110
Advanced Options this option here is

140
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,200
usually set to fill with background

141
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
color and when you do that it whatever

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,430
your background color is in this case

143
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,950
it's white for us it's this color right

144
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,740
over here whatever is selected there

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,930
when you create the new document it's

146
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,020
going to create that as your background

147
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,090
color it assumes you're working with a

148
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,830
blank white canvas and you want to

149
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,630
create art on top of that white canvas

150
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,180
or blue or red or whatever color you

151
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,340
have selected there but if you want to

152
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,260
create something like a logo like the

153
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,060
 icon or you want to create

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,740
something for our website it's a very

155
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,060
good idea to have transparency

156
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,889
especially you want to create some

157
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,479
contour and some shape besides a

158
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,110
rectangle or square so to do that we go

159
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,479
file new and then we click here under

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
Advanced Options and then under the fill

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,700
width we just say fill with the

162
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,860
transparency and that'll automatically

163
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,070
give us a transparent background and

164
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,139
automatically add an alpha channel in

165
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,360
there and so now we have a background

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,669
here something people will do is they'll

167
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,950
have a canvas like this they'll set up a

168
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,500
blank background and then they'll

169
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,539
right-click over here and go new layer

170
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,610
and they'll have their second layer and

171
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,770
they'll call this I don't know whatever

172
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,750
whatever they're drawing they'll call it

173
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,700
something over here and then they'll go

174
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,409
and then you can also choose when you're

175
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,670
creating a layer to fill it

176
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,370
with transparency or with white or with

177
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,290
a specific pattern or with the

178
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,910
background color foreground color but

179
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,710
maybe you'll say fill it with white and

180
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,200
then what you have is you still have a

181
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,660
white canvas you can still draw on here

182
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,880
what's big you can still draw and do

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,670
whatever you wanted to but then when you

184
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,740
want to erase you'll still be able to

185
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,140
erase if you wanted to you could erase

186
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,690
some of that white canvas to reveal the

187
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,230
true transparency behind it so again

188
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,090
real quick recap if we were to open up a

189
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,490
just an image from the desktop we

190
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,350
grabbed an image here we want to work

191
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,860
with it

192
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,190
we don't have transparency by default so

193
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,110
when we try to erase you races into

194
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,270
white if we want to have transparency

195
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,060
there you can also convert to if if you

196
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,360
accidentally you started erasing and you

197
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,700
you forgot and realized oh I wanted all

198
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,680
this stuff to be transparent and you

199
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,750
don't want to have to undo an add an add

200
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
transparency because if we add

201
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,880
transparency now it's going to just be

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,200
which now when we click it's going to be

203
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,340
it but the stuff we already did isn't

204
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,770
happening or isn't transparent so one

205
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,180
thing you can do is you can go up to

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,580
colors and then you go down to color to

207
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,870
alpha we wanted we don't want to adjust

208
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,760
yet because we need to select just a

209
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,620
certain color so we could use like the

210
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,420
magic wand selection we could select

211
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,100
this hold down shift it's like both of

212
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,680
these and then we can go to colors and

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,560
go to color to alpha and what that will

214
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,570
do is turn everything within that

215
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,270
selected area and that is this specific

216
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,750
color it turns it to alpha so that adds

217
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,220
it in there that's kind of a way to do

218
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,260
it we could shrink and grow that maybe

219
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,090
that a little bit differently so that's

220
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,920
just a quick look at transparency and

221
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,480
alpha we're going to be using it more in

222
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,460
future tutorials so I wanted to give a

223
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,960
quick introduction let you play with it

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,270
a little bit and mostly learn how you

225
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,970
can get an alpha channel or how you can

226
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,240
start working with transparency in

227
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,130
so hopefully found that informative

228
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,299
leave your questions or comments below

229
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,130
if you have any and I'll catch you in

230
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,790
