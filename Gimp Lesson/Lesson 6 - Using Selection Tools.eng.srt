00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome to another tutorial in this

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,029
video we'll be learning about the

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,650
different selection tools we have

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,349
available in for selecting certain

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,809
areas of our image and creating a custom

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,969
selection that we can then apply changes

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,490
to so this is common if we want to only

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,230
apply changes in here like you race for

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,960
example it'll only erase to wherever we

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,179
have selected any of our brushes will

11
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,849
only be drawn in this selection this is

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,259
also pretty common for doing something

13
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,880
like a color effect where you'll select

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,009
just a certain area and we can go to

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,200
like hue and saturation and change the

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,210
hue of whatever selected in that area

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,620
also what you'll do a lot is you'll do a

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,050
rectangular selection like this and then

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,090
you can go to image crop to selection

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,370
and sort of cut out or you could get a

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,320
really tight shot in here of just these

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,180
strawberries and we can go to crop a

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,070
selection and then you'll just have this

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,840
image we could then export or do

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,720
something to so let me do ctrl Z and

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,670
undo all of this and let's start from

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,290
the very beginning learning how to use

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,630
these selection tools the first tool

29
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,440
we're going to look at is the

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,720
rectangular Select tool R is the

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,910
shortcut key to get into that tool and

32
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,010
that just lets us draw a rectangle or a

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,740
square to draw it we just left we hold

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,840
down the left mouse button and then

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,020
unhold it to create the selection once

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,460
it's created we can change it by

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,440
hovering to the top and changing how

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,420
tall it is either at the top or the

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,370
bottom and I'm just left clicking and

40
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,710
holding to change that again that only

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,630
appears when you get close towards the

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,180
edge sort of those handles will appear

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,190
for doing that you can go to the corner

44
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,830
and change the corners as well and so

45
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,960
the bottom left-hand corner is now fixed

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,540
and the other two are changed here if I

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,710
click on the left one the bottom

48
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,270
right-hand corner is fixed and

49
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,130
everything else has changed so you can

50
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,350
use these methods to sort of select the

51
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,180
part of the image you want with a

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,390
rectangular selection if we want to move

53
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,100
the entire selection around we can use

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,590
the Move tool so we click on the move

55
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,500
tool by default I believe it's set to

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,790
moving the layer you have the entire

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,560
layer so it's going to kind of move our

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,180
image and we see this transparency in

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,098
the background I'm gonna hit control Z

60
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,139
to get it back because what I want to do

61
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,450
to move the selection we see under the

62
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,819
settings for move it have

63
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,739
it has an option for moving just the

64
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,140
selection so I'll left click on that and

65
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,629
now when I move this around it'll move

66
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,750
my selection and not my image so I can

67
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,459
move this down to the part of the image

68
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,810
I want and maybe I'll just go to image

69
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,340
crop to selection to get that nice

70
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,560
selected area so now we can either work

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
on our image just having the whole thing

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,310
selected if you notice the whole part is

73
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,319
still selected right now we can see

74
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,609
these little black and white lines

75
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,640
moving around the outside and that shows

76
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,260
us everything is selected which means

77
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,510
any tools that we use right now we're

78
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,180
going to apply to the entire image but

79
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,590
if we only wanted to select a certain

80
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,900
area like the strawberry we might use

81
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,639
this next tool which is the ellipse

82
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,799
select tool it's going to let us draw an

83
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,560
ellipse or a circle similar to the

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
rectangular tool we just left click and

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,269
hold and whatever selection we draw it

86
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,819
draws a new selection every time so if

87
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,650
we want to apply some smudges to just

88
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,780
this part of the strawberry we select

89
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,000
this we can come over and resize the

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,950
circle similar to we did like how we did

91
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,900
with the rectangle and then we can come

92
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,060
and grab the smudge tool and now only

93
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,980
smudging is going to happen within our

94
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,379
selected area and nothing outside will

95
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,109
be affected I mean it ctrl Z to undo

96
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:29,870
those changes if we want to select

97
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,030
multiple strawberries or multiple parts

98
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,730
of our image we can grab this tool any

99
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,290
of these tools have these options and

100
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,959
under mode just like we changed with the

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,299
Move mode there's also this ellipse

102
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,160
select mode right now it says replace

103
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,199
the current selection but we could also

104
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,299
go add to current selection when we're

105
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,510
in this mode anything we draw will get

106
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,340
added to it and create sort of this

107
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,280
different shape I can create like a

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,049
snowman shape here but then we have this

109
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,879
part selected over here as well so I

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,500
could select every strawberry

111
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,709
individually like this and then we have

112
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,900
a nice sort of selection of just our

113
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,180
strawberries there's also part of the

114
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,849
mode that lets us subtract from the

115
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,440
current selection so if I didn't want if

116
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,030
I wanted to change this I just kind of

117
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,209
draw and subtract this out this isn't

118
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,070
necessarily the best way to do this but

119
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,930
it is a method of doing it and if you're

120
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,360
selecting a kind of a circular object it

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,159
can be kind of nice like this bucket

122
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:27,680
here we can select this and sort of

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
cut out part everything that's not

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,139
within this selection so that's just a

125
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,610
method for doing this election we hit

126
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,440
enter and we can have that be our total

127
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,419
selection and then anything that we

128
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,060
apply within here is going to be only

129
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,600
applied to that selected area the next

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,009
tool we'll look at is the freehand

131
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,440
selection tool this lets us let click

132
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,210
with our mouse to create these points

133
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,280
and we can create any type of custom

134
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,470
shape we want when we get to the end

135
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,180
we'll just click on the very last point

136
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,770
and then we can come in here and adjust

137
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,259
by left clicking and holding and adjust

138
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,820
these to get just the shape that we want

139
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,949
when we think we have it right we'll hit

140
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,380
enter and that becomes our selected area

141
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,780
we can then use any tool that we want to

142
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,699
to apply changes only within the

143
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,710
selected area and nothing outside will

144
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,169
be affected I want to also bring your

145
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,389
attention to the different options on

146
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,009
these tools we have this feathered edge

147
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,080
and what the feathering helps you do is

148
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,449
if you're ever doing something maybe we

149
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,430
draw a circle here just to show this if

150
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,349
we grab a brush and right now we just

151
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,330
fill the whole thing in with black we

152
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,349
see it has a very hard edge but if we

153
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,659
turn on feathering so I'll grab the

154
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,370
ellipse tool again and we'll check this

155
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,570
feather edges

156
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,120
what feather edges does is create a

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,360
softer edge around the selected area so

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,949
now if we grab the brush tool and fill

159
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,530
this in we see the edges are much softer

160
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,659
we don't have a hard edge like we did on

161
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,240
this one so if I go to select I can

162
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,760
right click and go to select all so now

163
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,889
we see without the selection on these we

164
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,780
have a soft edge here a feathered edge

165
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,389
on this selection and no feather on this

166
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,030
one so the feather can kind of help you

167
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,139
merge in and make it look more natural

168
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,380
without a hard edge on it and again

169
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,419
that's feathering and it's a good idea

170
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,620
to go through and play with the

171
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,570
different options anti-aliasing also

172
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,639
helps smooth the edges out around your

173
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,220
selected area when you have something

174
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,259
selected as well we can change the

175
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,570
position of a selection here by just

176
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,210
manually if we know where we want it to

177
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,340
be on the pixels we can change the size

178
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,610
of it this way as well and so there's

179
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,870
some really good options we can play

180
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,759
with under the properties of each

181
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,610
different selection method we control Z

182
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,830
and get back another selection method I

183
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,030
want to show is

184
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,040
this similar to the freehand selection

185
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,410
we're gonna skip a few this is the

186
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,810
scissor selection and it does similar to

187
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,790
freehand only it's more intelligent so

188
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,860
we just left-click and we can come over

189
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,200
here and left-click again and it's gonna

190
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,250
try and estimate where we want what part

191
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,960
of the object we want to follow it

192
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,990
didn't do a great job in this case but

193
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,850
it'll kind of try to follow some of the

194
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,980
lines around and then we can always come

195
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,780
in here and re-click an add one in to

196
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,610
get it exactly where we want and again

197
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,650
we hit the enter key and now we have

198
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,140
this part of the image selected we could

199
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,090
do something like ctrl C on the keyboard

200
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,700
to copy this and then we can get if we

201
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,010
were in a new document we can go control

202
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,350
V and paste just that part of the image

203
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,720
but we see it is kind of jagged because

204
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,940
we didn't have a feather applied so we

205
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,260
might want to apply a feather to that

206
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,080
instead I'm gonna close out of this or

207
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,850
we could make a change to it we can just

208
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,640
do some adjusting in here if we did try

209
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,100
to crop if we went to image crop to

210
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,050
selection just be aware it's gonna

211
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,330
always crop a square it's not going to

212
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,700
cut it out to cut it out we'd want you

213
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,010
to use something under edit so we can

214
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,140
right click and go to edit and we can do

215
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,690
cut we can actually cut this and remove

216
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,300
it and have a blank space in there we

217
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,040
can right click and go to edit we can go

218
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,170
fill with so we can fill with the

219
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,720
foreground color similar to using the

220
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,610
bucket tool there's lots of different

221
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,350
options and we'll play with more of that

222
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,890
in the future these other ones if I'm

223
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,780
going to go to select and go to all

224
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,510
these other ones here we have and your

225
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,980
icons may look different we have the

226
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,400
fuzzy select and the select by color

227
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,780
they're gonna kind of behave similar in

228
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,280
this one select by color does what you

229
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,630
might expect where if you select a

230
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,880
certain color it selects everything

231
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,070
within that color and so we can turn

232
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,990
this threshold down over here to the

233
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,480
left and then it will select much finer

234
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,760
it really helps you have if you have a

235
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,980
good solid color you're trying to select

236
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,470
otherwise it's gonna try to grab more

237
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,630
like it's getting this sort of greens

238
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,710
and tans in the bucket and in the leaves

239
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,390
the fuzzy select is going to help us get

240
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,790
away from that problem turn down the

241
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,790
threshold a little bit it's hard to tell

242
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,350
with this example but it really is only

243
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,860
if we

244
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,779
our threshold right we can then select

245
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,480
just a certain area and just make

246
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,339
changes to just those leaves or just

247
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,350
these parts of the strawberries but

248
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,300
again it's not perfect like we had there

249
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,820
certain pixels are going to select

250
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,740
different shaded areas especially

251
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,860
gradients and shading so it may or may

252
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,899
not work depending on the image you're

253
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,180
using anyway that's some of the

254
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,649
different selection methods you can play

255
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,000
with we'll touch more on these ones

256
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,170
they're a little bit more advanced so

257
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,940
we'll touch more on using the threshold

258
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,079
and playing with some of these in the

259
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,209
future there's also ways we can combine

260
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,680
different ones but just be aware of the

261
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,230
selection mode is really important and

262
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,540
if you do get on the mode one common

263
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,579
mistake is that if you go to cut

264
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:35,990
something out and you cut the whole

265
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,880
thing out and then you forget you were

266
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,680
in that mode and you go to draw a

267
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,630
selection it won't let you it just gives

268
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,660
you this symbol you can always look for

269
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,130
cues down at the bottom if something's

270
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,190
not working it tells us cannot subtract

271
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,769
from an empty selection it's because

272
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,300
we're on the subtraction mode right now

273
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,730
one thing I like to do is just stay in

274
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,550
this mode here the replaced current

275
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,589
selection mode and then use the shortcut

276
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,240
keys we can hover over and learn those

277
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,310
shift and control so if in this mode we

278
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,899
draw and we draw again

279
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,600
it replaces our selection holding shift

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,790
we can add to that without having to go

281
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,010
and change the mode so we can add to our

282
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,320
selection and holding ctrl we can

283
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,660
subtract to that and that works with all

284
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,550
these different ones we can do freehand

285
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,089
hold shift and add in a new part and hit

286
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,000
enter so we can add in different parts

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,339
if we want to if we can freehand draw in

288
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,649
these and then we could freehand draw

289
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,190
out some of the selection as well so it

290
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,050
can be really handy so learn those

291
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,839
shortcut keys shift and control is going

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,899
to avoid some confusion in this mode

293
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,070
we'll go ahead and play with some of

294
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,140
these different selection methods it may

295
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,060
not be clear right now how powerful this

296
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,589
is but as we start using more of the

297
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,060
color tools and some of the different

298
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,490
filters it's going to be really powerful

299
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,250
and understanding a good foundation

300
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,570
understanding how selection works is

301
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,040
going to help you avoid a lot of

302
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,620
confusion and frustration in the future

303
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,000
so go ahead and leave your question in

304
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,740
the comments below if you have any and I

305
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,339
look forward to catching you in the next

306
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,490
you
