00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,430
welcome to another audacity tutorial in

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,690
this video I'm going to show you how to

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,379
generate audio and sounds other than

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,539
from using your microphone or importing

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,070
audio we can just generate right from

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,570
within audacity so maybe you want to

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,609
create a sound for an animation or video

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,039
game or you want to generate something a

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,470
sound to integrate into your existing

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,960
audio this is how you can do that so the

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,550
easiest thing to do to get started is to

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,039
just generate a tone so if we go to tone

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,660
it brings up this box it creates an

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,210
audio track for us and it just says what

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,220
do you want the waveform to be first of

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,920
all so sine is gonna be kind of smooth

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,210
square and sawtooth are gonna be more

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,000
like harsh on your ears then at the

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
frequency so how many times do you want

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,090
that wave to repeat in Hertz and so this

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,460
is like 440 and then the amplitude how

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,590
loud do you want it like how high do you

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,600
want the wave to go and then if we ever

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,100
want to change these defaults if your

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,270
looking different than mine you can go

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,020
to manage factory presets defaults with

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,030
lots of different effects and generate

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,339
lots of the things has this manage tab

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,390
so you can always get back to the

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,700
defaults that way but I'll just hit OK

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,860
oh and the duration mindset - 3 seconds

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,680
yours might be 30 but anyway so this is

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,120
a three-second long tone that sounds

34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,870
like this it's kind of loud kind of

35
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,700
obnoxious we can go to effects and we

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,620
can also apply like effects on top of

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,659
this if we want to so it'd be like this

38
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,040
so that's how you can kind of start to

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,650
get and create a sound by combining

40
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,600
something you generate with some effects

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,820
that we've already learned chirp is

42
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,530
gonna be like a tone that starts from

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,360
one point if we just leave this all

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,250
default it's gonna start at this

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,090
frequency ooh and make a change like

46
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,590
that that one also could get on your

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,049
nurse and then we could like you know we

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,460
can come in to effects and we could

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,690
reverse this if we want it to be

50
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,170
different we do reverse but we guess

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,990
what that first effects reverse and now

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,140
it's gonna go with this right like

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,760
something falling out of the sky in your

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,280
animation or something

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,409
let's close this so what else do we have

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,449
that we can generate we could just

57
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,709
generate noise if we want some like

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,389
white noise this is gonna be quiet

59
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,980
so by default let's go back

60
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,690
I played with this one a little bit by

61
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,040
default it's very very loud white noise

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,819
yeah but we can also we can go to change

63
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,920
this down to the amplitude so amplitudes

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,310
like kind of a different version of the

65
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,980
word amplify right so it's the it's

66
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,680
actually the height of the wave but if

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,239
we put some zeroes in here and make this

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,370
amplitude a much smaller number then it

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,030
makes this volume much much softer too

70
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,060
that makes it much lower what else do we

71
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,450
have here we can do this DT I'm not sure

72
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,459
what these do it's just okay and see so

73
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,900
there's kind of a tone I got pulled in

74
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,620
quickly pulsing pulsating tone so just

75
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,450
play with these play with generate we've

76
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,859
got some plucks and different things

77
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,209
here like a guitar string and then again

78
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,090
we can change this we can select it well

79
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,650
in the generation it's probably the best

80
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,629
way to to change it we can change like

81
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,819
what you know how long is it gonna be

82
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,140
what type of fade-out do you want to

83
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,970
have like what do we want to be like

84
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,329
this but you can also select the whole

85
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,069
thing and go to effects and apply some

86
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,209
of these different effects to it that

87
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,639
we've learned like pitch speed add some

88
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,200
more bass or treble to it just kind of

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,560
yeah change the sound a little bit

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,690
rhythm track so we get a look like a

91
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,880
little drum sound so you can create

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,130
instruments too if for like for using in

93
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,930
like lmms like we've learned about if

94
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,280
you check it out that my other tutorial

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,530
so you can create like an lms sound and

96
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,870
then bring it into lmms and then

97
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,190
obviously you can change a lot of these

98
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,019
wave settings and different settings

99
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,739
there as well so play with these you

100
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,419
know get familiar with generating and I

101
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,379
guess what's this say I haven't done

102
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,910
this so add removed plugins I guess you

103
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,829
can probably add more plugins here if

104
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,019
you're interested in using audacity in

105
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,389
this method you know generating audio

106
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,329
rather than just rather than bringing it

107
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:13,650
in from your microphone or or

108
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,389
downloading something there's probably

109
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,798
some different plugins here that we can

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,000
get to bring in so maybe I'll make a

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
video on that too if I learn more about

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,509
using that

113
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,380
appreciate you watching this video go

114
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,240
ahead and like comment subscribe leave

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,819
your questions comments below and I hope

116
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,380
to see you in another video soon
