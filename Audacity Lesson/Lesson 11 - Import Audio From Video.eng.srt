00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,890
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,960
tutorial in this video I'm gonna show

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,780
you how you can grab the audio portion

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,190
of a movie or video file using audacity

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,130
so I have this video here

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,220
it's just when we grabbed off at pixabay

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,410
it has some rain falling on a window and

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,650
it just sounds like this so let's say I

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,169
want to just make an edit to the audio

10
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,720
portion of this video so we can actually

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,300
just take it left click and drag this

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,540
video on to audacity and it will bring

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,810
in just the audio this is really cool

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,810
so a couple about a month ago actually I

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,630
had a client to send me a video that he

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,880
was having trouble syncing so he had

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,430
recorded it on his iPhone and by the it

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,590
was like an hour long or a 30 minute

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,750
long presentation and by the end of it

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,420
his audio was off by like 2 or 3 seconds

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,460
and so I was able to fix it using

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,210
audacity I just did brought the video in

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,100
just like this and got the audio portion

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,140
of it and then I adjusted it in audacity

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,650
by 2 seconds I just lengthened it out

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,730
and then made sure the pitch and

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,980
everything was the same and then I used

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,540
kdenlive to put the video back together

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,900
and so that's a kind of a practical use

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,240
of this but anyway maybe we want to get

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,260
just this rain sound so we could now

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,710
just go file export as mp3 or WAV and

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,870
then we have the audio of this maybe

34
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,430
it's a music video but we just want to

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,260
listen to the music on our mp3 player so

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,600
we could just do it as simple as that or

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,610
we can take and we only want to use like

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,380
a portion of the audio so we can select

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,590
a certain portion clip everything else

40
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,450
outside of that make sure we set it to

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,060
the our beginning here and then we have

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,770
just a small little sample of rain

43
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,579
this rain and thunder sound so that's

44
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:58,539
really it

45
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,070
I guess since this video is super short

46
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,810
I'll talk a little about exporting since

47
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,350
I kind of you know gone through that

48
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,990
quickly in past videos so one thing

49
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,810
about audacity is if we go to save if we

50
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,730
just save project it's gonna bring up

51
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,549
this warning dialog box and say hey just

52
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,470
so you know if you save it's not going

53
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,599
to save on sound file it's gonna save an

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,239
audacity project file so we came back

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,040
okay that's fine so if we save this on

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,860
our desktop and hit save this file looks

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,190
like this it's a folder with just like

58
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,829
some weird folders and weird things in

59
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:35,410
it so this is not dasa T file and then

60
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,640
when we go to if we close out of

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,079
audacity and then we get back into

62
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,260
audacity well actually this is that this

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,970
is a file but this is associated with it

64
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,739
but so if we go to open it up we go to

65
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,680
open and we go desktop then we can

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,260
actually open this project right here

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,170
called run off so we can open this and

68
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,090
see it but if we want to save just the

69
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,129
audio portion like export the audio to

70
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:00,160
use in a video project or to have an mp3

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,730
to listen to we can go export export as

72
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,069
WAV and then we can export to the

73
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,709
desktop so save and now it's an actual

74
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,250
WAV file as well so I'm gonna delete

75
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,220
this bit of clothes out of it first I'm

76
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,900
gonna delete this and now we have just a

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,650
WAV file we can listen to of just that

78
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,660
portion that we edited one thing I

79
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,700
forgot to say you have to have ffmpeg

80
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,470
installed ffmpeg is like a free

81
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,510
open-source software for video and audio

82
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,730
processing and I don't think it comes by

83
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,709
default with audacity I'm pretty sure

84
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,030
the first time I did it when I tried to

85
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,579
drag and drop a video in it said you

86
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,959
don't have ffmpeg do you want to

87
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,639
automatically download it I just clicked

88
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,370
yes and it did that so if that dialog

89
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,780
box comes up for you when you're trying

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,790
to do this on Windows you can go ahead

91
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,919
and do that you can also download ffmpeg

92
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,810
just do a Google search or maybe I'll

93
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,010
make a video of it but search audacity

94
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,780
install SSM peg if you do a google

95
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,950
search for that you'll find a tutorial

96
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,230
showing you how to do that but you do

97
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,359
have to have ffmpeg and I'm trying to

98
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,859
think here I don't know if I if I can

99
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,109
actually testing I don't know if I can

100
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,810
export mp3s

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,460
maybe I can no see ya so I also don't

102
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,620
have a lame properly installed so let me

103
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,060
make a video on that showing how to get

104
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,310
lanes configured and ffmpeg configured

105
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,279
for you because you can't export oh here

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,300
we go right here just click download

107
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,130
maybe it'll just do it or maybe it'll

108
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,350
take us to the page anyway you can go

109
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,550
you can just walk through these steps

110
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,920
here and it tells you how to do it but

111
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,940
I'll make a video kind of walking

112
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,980
through it as well because you have to

113
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,390
have in order to export your mp3s you'll

114
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,870
have to have that what else when we

115
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,480
export OGG is that can open source audio

116
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,770
format so that's a cool one you can

117
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,040
export in you can export as MIDI but

118
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,570
that's only gonna be if you actually

119
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,710
have a MIDI sequence export audio lets

120
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,600
us just choose oh cool so if you want to

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,850
export in a different version you can

122
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,190
just go export audio then you can choose

123
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,590
from this drop-down so if you want to do

124
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,520
like this FLAC is like a lossless really

125
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
good like audio format there's always

126
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,370
there's like different file different

127
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,380
formats as well but and if it says

128
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,270
ffmpeg after it then you have to have

129
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,460
ffmpeg installed in order to do these

130
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,320
like these are more like video like

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
formats that like this AAC is an audio

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,020
type that gets used in video quite often

133
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,330
so but that's how you would save

134
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,120
something other than these ones that it

135
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,630
just gives you by default these three so

136
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,830
that turned into a kind of more of a

137
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,140
video than just importing audio tracks

138
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,850
from a video but hopefully you found

139
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,520
that informative and I'll catch you on

140
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,940
the next video
