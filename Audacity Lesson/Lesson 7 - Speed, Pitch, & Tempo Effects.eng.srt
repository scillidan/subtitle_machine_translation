00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,460
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,680
tutorial in this video we're going to be

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
playing with some different effects the

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,860
ones we're gonna do are changing the

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,110
speed changing the tempo and changing

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,320
the pitch so to get started let's go

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,650
ahead and just let's record in some

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,119
voice so that we can get a good idea for

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,640
what's happening here this is test audio

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,449
testing one two three

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,759
okay so now we have our audio in here if

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,109
we play it back that sounds just like it

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,750
did when I said it so if we want to

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,010
change the speed of this change it so it

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,930
plays back faster that's kind of one of

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,110
the most common things first of all like

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,430
we learned in our last video we have to

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,380
make a selection so if we go to FX and

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,660
go down to change speed we're gonna get

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,250
this kind of an error message and just

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,110
saying or this dialog that says you need

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,030
to make a selection first we can press

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,750
ctrl a to select all so ctrl a we can

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,420
also just select all by ourselves like

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,320
doing this do or we can just select any

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,820
portion that we want to increase the

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,080
speed but I'm going to do select all

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
this another way to do is go to select

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,820
and then go to all and then we can go to

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,990
effects and speed change speed and then

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,250
this is sort of like we did with the

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,050
amplification we have a slider bar here

33
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,140
and we have some different numbers so if

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,880
we change the speed multiplier down to

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,290
zero again we're going to be Oh actually

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,530
the percent change is zero if we change

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,080
the percent this to zero and the speed

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,659
to one it's going to be same speed

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,880
nothing will change so we do okay so

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,950
that's kind of our baseline so knowing

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,510
that we can change the speed to either

42
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,120
faster or slower to be either less than

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,030
1 on the multiplier or more than 1 so if

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,700
we did 2 here it would be twice as fast

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,210
and it was so it would be 100% increased

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,299
by 100% if we did 0.5 it would be 50% of

47
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,128
normal speed so you can control either

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,919
one of these two boxes are linked so

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,090
let's just do this real quick let's do

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,740
the 50% let's do it

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,750
half as fast as this normally supposed

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,720
to be so we go okay and then we see what

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,610
first of all happened our first audio

54
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,100
recording was four seconds long or four

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,570
and a half I guess and now it's like

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,170
nine seconds long because it's half the

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,180
speed so it takes twice as long to play

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,630
that so let's play and see so it's just

59
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,280
slow-motion like you would imagine

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,560
let's go undo we click this back arrow

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,270
here or we can press ctrl Z on the

62
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,520
keyboard it's still selected so let's go

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,750
to FX change speed and now let's we can

64
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,490
type in if we want to do two but we can

65
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,020
also use the slider to get it kind of a

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,020
more granular so let's go to let's do it

67
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,960
about maybe one point seven six and then

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,540
we go okay so now you see it's almost

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,640
instead of being four and a half seconds

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,770
it's only two and a half seconds so it's

71
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,150
gonna be much quicker because it's

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,260
playing faster so we'll play this and

73
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,910
you notice the pitch of my voice changed

74
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,130
to when it was long it was very low

75
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,260
there's a lot lower because it's slowed

76
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,780
down I guess what I'm saying is not only

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,610
did it slow down the audio it also in

78
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,220
the process lowered and raised the pitch

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,870
of my voice so it's like high pitch now

80
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,460
and so the way we can change that if you

81
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,100
want to speed something up slightly but

82
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,960
you don't want to increase the the pitch

83
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,580
maybe it's music need to throw off the

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,120
key

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,840
let's go back the thing we can do is we

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
can actually go to effects change tempo

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,010
and what that's going to do is change

88
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,220
the speed it's gonna change how quickly

89
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,980
the file the wave is being played but

90
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,280
it's not going to adjust the pitch so we

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,740
can select all of this let's go to

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,660
control a to select all and let's go

93
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,400
affect change tempo so now we can change

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,490
the tempo and have it be played one and

95
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,270
a half times faster than it normally is

96
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,780
wait a percentage maybe this needs to be

97
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,579
so actually let's play it 150 percent

98
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,680
normal then it needs to be or than it

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,500
was regularly and we click OK so now

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,210
look it shrinks it down but now if we

101
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,710
play I don't think my voice will be

102
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,520
high-pitched

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,440
you see so it's my my voice is the same

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,540
pitch as it is now it's just playing

105
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,180
through much faster I'm gonna do control

106
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,590
Z I'm gonna do control C and control V

107
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,270
so we have this twice and we're going to

108
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,890
I'm gonna show them back-to-back so we

109
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,210
see what's happening here let's go to

110
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,800
effect change speed let's make this one

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,240
1.5 or actually so we're doing the same

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,830
thing we'll make it a hundred and fifty

113
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,470
percent and we or let's just make it a

114
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,170
hundred percent go okay and then let's

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,000
select this part I just double click on

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,710
it to select just that area cuz see

117
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,780
there's look separation between them and

118
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,360
we go effects change tempo and it

119
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,570
changed this to one hundred and go okay

120
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,640
so now we can play these two and one is

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
Jett they're both the same they both

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,930
take about two seconds long to play but

123
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,740
one is gonna be a higher pitch you see

124
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,420
what I'm saying so they these both have

125
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,400
the same tempo but they have a different

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,290
pitch I'm gonna come to the end here and

127
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,630
do control V and paste this file again

128
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,610
this is the original again so if I

129
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,200
double click this and select it all we

130
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,060
can go to effects and this third thing

131
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,490
we can change is the pitch so if we

132
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,270
change the pitch of this we can actually

133
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,250
change the pitch and make me talk in a

134
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,840
different key so it's saying right now I

135
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
don't know if this auto-detects I'm not

136
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,560
actually exactly sure but this is saying

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
change it from F so if any note if any

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,770
yeah basically if there's anything that

139
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,380
was an F will get changed to down to AG

140
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,390
sharp or a flat if you're if you

141
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,070
understand music and so what's going

142
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,650
down eight point eight four semitones

143
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,710
and so we can adjust this to or it's

144
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,140
also in so this is why do pitch this is

145
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,030
everyone do frequency so it's changing

146
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,390
from a frequency of 50 500 Hertz down to

147
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,320
a frequency of 3,300 Hertz and that

148
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,810
change represents roughly forty percent

149
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,910
so you could imagine if we double click

150
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,070
and change this to zero this is neutral

151
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,200
this is from the key of F to the key of

152
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,110
F this is from this Hertz to this source

153
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,400
which is the same so if

154
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,960
want to make it a higher pitch we had

155
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,090
above zero we that this percent change

156
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,800
be above zero if I want to make it a

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,870
lower pitch this is below in the

158
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,080
negative so let's let's make it let's

159
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,610
just make my voice a tiny bit lower

160
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,330
let's go down let's go down like just

161
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,280
20% lower maybe like this

162
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,990
21% lower and okay so the speed is the

163
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,550
same you see it didn't change the size

164
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,979
of this it's still lasting about four

165
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,539
and a half seconds but it's going to be

166
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:09,979
lower let's play and see if it sounds

167
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:16,820
different okay so I'm gonna undo that

168
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,400
let's now it's back to normal I can

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,169
double click and we can change the pitch

170
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,639
again and we could this time we can make

171
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,220
it high we can make it be above zero so

172
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,690
we come over here to above zero and

173
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,389
let's make it 20% faster than it

174
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,210
originally was recorded in so we go okay

175
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,520
all right so there we go we've got we've

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,460
changed we can change the speed if we go

177
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,310
to effects change speed that changes how

178
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,800
quickly it's played or slowly it's

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,900
played and it also changes the pitch so

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,570
speed that does both speed is basically

181
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,330
doing pitch and tempo at the same time

182
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,070
pitch obviously just does the pitch that

183
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,590
if it's high or low and tempo just does

184
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,470
the speed and keeps the pitch constant

185
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,940
so play with those three and then I want

186
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,409
to show you one more thing if we just go

187
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,500
file new and we bring in this audio file

188
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,449
I'll go open this jazz guitar

189
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,639
so suppose we know what key this is in

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,830
this this music

191
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,640
let's say it's in the key of G maybe so

192
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,740
if this is in the key of G and we want

193
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,060
to transfer we want to change this

194
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,860
someone sends us some music and they say

195
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,020
hey we're trying to sync this together

196
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
with like another piece of music or I or

197
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,380
they or they want to have someone

198
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,330
accompany and play along with it but

199
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,130
they need it to be in the key of F and

200
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,740
not the key of G we can go okay cool we

201
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,800
go to effects we go to change pitch and

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,810
then we can change it so we can say

203
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,280
change it from the key of G to the key

204
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,440
of F uh-huh and then we go okay and so I

205
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,970
just changed the key on there now if we

206
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,510
play it sounds kind of the same right

207
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,640
but it actually is different we'll play

208
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,980
this and I'll do undoing we'll see do

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,110
see so it's lower the music's down

210
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,460
sounds the same but you just changed the

211
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
key and so that's why it's kind of nice

212
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,900
with this that it lets you

213
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,170
oops effects change pitch it's nice if

214
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,060
it lets you do that if you do know the

215
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,100
key that it's in that's why this is

216
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
that's why this is pretty nice for

217
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,200
changing music and then as far as voice

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,580
goes you might just use the frequencies

219
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,430
or the slider well I hope that made

220
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,870
sense to you go ahead and play with

221
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,570
these different effects and you're

222
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,470
welcome to click on some of these other

223
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,790
ones too you'll notice they all work

224
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,800
kind of similarly sometimes it will

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,540
bring up a dialog box sometimes it won't

226
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,160
but we'll be looking to some more of

227
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,020
these in future tutorials appreciate you

228
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,160
