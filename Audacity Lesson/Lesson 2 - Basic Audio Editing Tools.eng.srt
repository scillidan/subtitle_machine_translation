00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,130
welcome back to another audio editing

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,290
tutorial using audacity in this video

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,820
we're going to learn how to record in

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,619
some audio and we'll be looking at these

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,539
different tools here up in the toolbar

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,239
to make changes to that audio so to

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,439
start I'm just going to record in a

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,980
simple audio file that we can edit

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,689
testing testing 1 2 3 so again to do

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,830
that recording I just hit the record

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,539
button with my left mouse button and

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,039
then when I'm done recording I

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,019
left-click on this square this stop

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,150
button if I want to play it back I can

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,740
just hit this green play button and

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,540
we'll play from the beginning if I want

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,980
to pause at any point I can hit the

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,800
pause button to pause testing so I've

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,570
paused now and now we see there's this

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,070
black line right where I've paused

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,870
that's how I know where I'm at in the

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,360
recording you'll notice there's like a

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,460
this selection tool is currently

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,890
selected or pressed in we can change the

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,200
tool by left clicking what tool we want

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,970
to be on but right now we're on the

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,890
selection tool and that means it lets us

28
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,720
select or different portions of the

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,210
audio so if I left click it'll move that

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,349
black line I'll stay there kind of where

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,420
the playhead is but the black line where

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,310
I have my selection made is where it'll

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,080
start playing from if I hit play again

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,150
so now if I hit playing it'll just play

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,380
this the last thing I said which I

36
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,640
believe was the number 3 3 and it'll

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,159
play and then get to the end and stop if

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,110
I want to play just a certain portion if

39
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,210
I want to start by saying 1 2 3 I can

40
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,250
click over here left click I get that

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,810
black line to appear then I can click

42
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,140
play 1 2 3 it'll play just that portion

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,409
of the audio if I want to play back from

44
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,020
the beginning these toggle moving to the

45
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,840
beginning and end of the audio file so

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,820
if I hit this button the playhead goes

47
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,290
back to the beginning if I hit this

48
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,450
button it goes to the end that's kind of

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,890
nice if you're working with a long video

50
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,229
file or if we're zoomed in very closely

51
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,549
and we want to get to the end or the

52
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,620
beginning a lot of times I'll just click

53
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,390
the beginning and then play to make sure

54
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,950
I play from the beginning because if

55
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,299
I've been editing somewhere and I hit

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,490
play I forget oh I don't want to be

57
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,810
playing from that portion I want to play

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,659
from the beginning so that helps a lot

59
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,409
if we want to get rid of a certain

60
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,020
portion let's say I only want to say

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,939
this isn't audio what did I say at the

62
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,029
first testing testing let's say I want

63
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,439
to get rid of my the first time I say

64
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,099
testing

65
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,640
which is sort of this area here and to

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,109
verify that I can left-click and hold

67
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,219
and select just those portions and now

68
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,959
when I hit play it will only play what's

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,359
in this highlighted area testing and

70
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,719
then it just stops testing while that's

71
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,489
highlighted I can come up here to edit

72
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,870
and I can do some different things to it

73
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,760
I can cut I can copy I can delete if I

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,530
wanted I can duplicate which is like

75
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,689
copy too but so if I just wanna delete

76
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,579
it I just hit the hit delete right there

77
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,769
and now that's gone now I'm not saying

78
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,389
testing there I'm saying only testing

79
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,099
once instead of twice so I can go back

80
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,590
to the beginning and play testing one

81
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,370
two three if I wanted to come back I can

82
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,739
go to edit and go undo delete and now

83
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,680
that's done that's a undone I mean it's

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,269
back now it's saying testing testing one

85
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,290
two three if I want to and a quicker way

86
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,549
to delete if I want to delete just this

87
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,139
portion I can just highlight it and hit

88
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,000
the Delete key on my keyboard and it

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,189
goes away I can highlight everything and

90
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,849
just hit delete and it all goes away if

91
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,859
I had control Z it'll bring those back

92
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:22,379
control Z's just like basically going at

93
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:22,530
it

94
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,930
undo it's just a shortcut key if I want

95
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,189
to select everything at once I can

96
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,189
double click and it selects everything

97
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,449
so let's say I had a really long

98
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,799
recording I wanted the whole thing to be

99
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,449
selected just double click it selects it

100
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,099
all and I can hit delete and now it's

101
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,409
gone I have nothing to get it back

102
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,349
edit undo and it comes back when things

103
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,579
are selected that's when you can apply

104
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,930
effects to them also there's all these

105
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,220
different effects we can do we can

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,739
amplify to increase the volume we can

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,810
add echo we can add some kind of fun

108
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,250
effects or we can just apply some

109
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,859
effects to make it more sound better and

110
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,389
make us you know reduce some of the

111
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,979
noise and things like that we'll be

112
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,439
doing that in future videos I want to

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,459
talk about some of these different tools

114
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,650
here so if I want to zoom in on where I

115
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,109
say 1 2 3 I want to zoom in closer on

116
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,599
one of those sound waves I can actually

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,109
click this zoom tool here so I left

118
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,419
click on it and then if I left click

119
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,608
anywhere that I left click on my WAV

120
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,608
file or my wave view down here it'll

121
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,919
zoom in and I can see what these are

122
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,529
looking like if I right click it'll zoom

123
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,990
out and left click will zoom in

124
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,300
so I can zoom way out so it's just

125
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400
looking like that I can zoom way in and

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,060
now I'm into like incredibly incredibly

127
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,620
granular so I'll come out here and zoom

128
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,449
out and we can see we can see exactly

129
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,449
what this part of the audio is so to

130
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,009
play from a certain point I have to go

131
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,199
back to my selection tool and then click

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,050
in here and click play one so that's me

133
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,970
saying 1 1 2 3 if I want to let's say I

134
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,759
want to move over and see what's

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,979
happening earlier in the audio I can

136
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,270
come down to the bottom and use this

137
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,090
slider to view to move around and see

138
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,080
different points of the audio I can also

139
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,150
hold down that can I do that now maybe

140
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,259
not I thought I could hold down the

141
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,580
mouse middle mouse button but I guess

142
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:23,720
not and I can I can use this slider and

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,520
I can also if I want to move so this

144
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,229
just changes the way that I'm looking at

145
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,539
the audio if I actually want to move it

146
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,550
to a different point I can come and zoom

147
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,979
out here let's say I want to move this

148
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,759
whole portion forward I can click this

149
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,250
tool at a time shift tool and that lets

150
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,430
me actually move the audio so right now

151
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,520
it was starting at 0 seconds and it was

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,320
playing until about 4 seconds I can tell

153
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,520
by looking at the top of the timeline

154
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,680
here but if I want to move it and have

155
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
empty space for the first second of

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,909
audio I can do that by just left

157
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,039
clicking and dragging the audio and now

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,270
if I go back to the beginning and hit

159
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,370
play it'll be silent for a second and

160
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,030
then my audio will start testing testing

161
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,090
and so it's actually it really is

162
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,409
actually complete silence and then you

163
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,699
kind of hear this little tiny bit of

164
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,400
noise as it comes in possibly so this is

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,870
the time shift to when it's how to move

166
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,210
around I wanted to show you one more

167
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,740
thing I actually cleared out that audio

168
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,780
but one more tool I wanted to show you

169
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,719
is that we can bring in some audio so if

170
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,090
we just go we can actually drag and drop

171
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,539
so if we bring in some music like I have

172
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,560
this this is like a WAV file as jazz

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,270
guitar we go properties it's a dot wave

174
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,310
I can just left click and drag and drop

175
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,320
this in here and it imports the audio

176
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,470
just like that

177
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,360
we can also go file and then we go to

178
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
import and we can import an audio and

179
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,870
actually import it in MIDI files as well

180
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,720
and we'll show them in denotation then

181
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,430
something I want to show with this this

182
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,800
last tool is if we hover over and look

183
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
this is the envelope tool and we can

184
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,460
left-click on it and it creates sort of

185
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,920
some gray lines across the top or like a

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,080
lighter gray in the middle what it lets

187
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,540
us do is if we just click one point if

188
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,910
we left click and hold we can move up

189
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,950
and down and control the volume and make

190
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,040
this very soft or much louder so now if

191
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,050
we play this it's what it sounds like we

192
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,730
can actually have it fade in by clicking

193
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,350
over here and choosing a second point so

194
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,450
now if we left click here we can

195
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,940
actually make this much softer and we

196
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,440
can move this and have it kind of fade

197
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,930
in loud we can click another point here

198
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,630
and make it kind of soft so we can have

199
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,190
that be loud and then just drop down to

200
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,880
soft automatically and so that's the

201
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,250
envelope tool to just adjusting volume

202
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,080
it kind of creates this envelope around

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
all the audio and you can adjust very

204
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,450
quickly the audio levels at certain

205
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,840
points in the wave so that's basically

206
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,100
it for the the tools up here that I

207
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,530
wanted to cover for today appreciate you

208
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,880
watching and I'll catch you in the next

209
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,060
