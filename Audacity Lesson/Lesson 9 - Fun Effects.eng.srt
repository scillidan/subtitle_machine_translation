00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,960
tutorial in this video we're going to be

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,669
playing with some more effects and kind

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,559
of just doing some fun effects in this

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,509
one we have some music down here that I

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,690
recorded in from the classic NES video

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,730
game contra let's play that a little bit

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,420
and see what it sounds like

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,510
and this is actually a kind of a looping

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,280
so if we go if we click up here this

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,290
will show us just kind of the extents

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,260
from the start to the finish so it's 25

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,930
seconds long it's meant to be a looping

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,000
piece so right here at changes it has

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,930
like two different kind of phrases it

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,610
goes into this phrase and then at the

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,170
end is supposed to loop back to the

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,480
start here so this is we're supposed to

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,710
loop back so if we select the whole

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,370
thing we can actually go to effect and

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,460
we can go to repeat and then it says how

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,660
many times do you want to repeat we'll

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,720
just say 1 and we go ok and what that

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,570
does is it actually attached it

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,190
basically did a copy and paste it copied

26
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,259
this whole selection then it pasted it

27
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,360
again at the end here so we can now our

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,759
cut our whole song is 50 seconds long

29
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,800
and we can play and see what the the

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,780
overlap part sounds like or where it

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,800
repeats so I'm gonna zoom in there

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,040
because it's just a little bit we have a

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,240
little bit of silence there where it's a

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
little hiccup where it's repeating so

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,190
let's go back where was it at right here

36
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,409
I mean I select that a little bit and

37
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,870
hit delete so we don't have much of a

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,010
drop you know even I'm just to get rid

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,810
of all that little line there and I

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,400
think now I should just go right into it

41
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,270
maybe it's a little bit too much there

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,450
about this

43
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,110
yeah a little bit of a hiccup but it's

44
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,880
okay so we go let's now if we go to the

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,270
full extent we see this we kind of

46
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,939
recognized as it's happening twice

47
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,219
actually born me and ooh I'm gonna go

48
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,739
ctrl Z ctrl Z and I'm gonna undo that

49
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,870
part because we're gonna be applying

50
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,160
some filters to this or some different

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,019
effects to it that's gonna take a little

52
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,580
bit of time to process so the shorter it

53
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,709
is the better okay is we could have

54
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,290
effects let's do so we have just like

55
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,110
Reverse if we reverse it

56
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,700
[Music]

57
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,510
it sounds okay right

58
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,189
doesn't sound that much different

59
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,510
because this is just like electronic

60
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,010
instruments creating this so I'll do

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,799
ctrl Z we can go to effects so we can do

62
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,360
a fade in and fade out the way that

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,519
works if we select whatever part we have

64
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,439
selected will be the fade so if I want

65
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,689
to fade in over the first two seconds I

66
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,150
just select from zero to two seconds I

67
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,989
go to effects fade in and if I want to

68
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,739
fade out I just select the last maybe

69
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,810
let's do the last three seconds and then

70
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,849
go effects fade out source net and now

71
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,470
this will fade in and out so we go to

72
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,160
the beginning

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,150
[Music]

74
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,010
and then when we get to the end it'll

75
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,099
fade out very nice did I ever show you

76
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,599
like with it how the scrubbing works if

77
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,760
we click up here when we have a screen

78
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,890
triangle just click it starts playing

79
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,150
and it will actually go wherever we

80
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,650
supply so we can click and drag a part

81
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,680
up here with some arrows and it'll just

82
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,060
play that selection rather than actually

83
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,379
having to select it like this we can

84
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,690
actually left click up here and draw and

85
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,910
it'll play wherever we can it whatever

86
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,900
wherever we tell it to and if we click

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,760
up in between here so there's a triangle

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,049
if we click up here to get these two

89
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,060
triangles it'll actually follow our

90
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,799
mouse cursor and play kind of like

91
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,709
scrubbing it'll scrub in the direction

92
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,569
of our mouse cursor at the normal

93
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,239
playback speed so if we click here now

94
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,090
it's playing if I go back if I hover

95
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,690
back the playhead follows in Reverse so

96
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,580
it just goes wherever my mouse goes

97
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,990
[Music]

98
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,600
and if I click and hold with my I'm

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
holding that with my left mouse button

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,290
then I can actually scrub fast or slow

101
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,150
and listen to whatever is happening in

102
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,310
that part of the song so anyway I said

103
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,450
what about playback I don't know if I

104
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,770
mentioned that in an earlier video or

105
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,770
not I'm going to select everything by

106
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,360
double clicking let's go to effects

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,480
there's this phaser effect that gives it

108
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,480
sort of this weird sound if we can bring

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,830
up the options for oh so we can adjust

110
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,650
it and apply it or we can just say start

111
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,830
playback it'll play the music so we can

112
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,990
listen to it and apply these settings as

113
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,980
it's playing so I'm gonna do that so

114
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,690
this is like a phaser effect if I go to

115
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,340
feedback and make it all the way full

116
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,560
you'll see what it's doing see that and

117
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,920
then we can change the effects here so

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:14,260
we can change how severe that is anyway

119
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,640
that's just sort of that phaser effect I

120
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,810
didn't apply it but that's the phaser

121
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,910
effect there's this effect called Paul

122
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,430
stretch if we do it we'll just leave

123
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,990
everything how it is there it kind of

124
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,060
just stretches out and makes your audio

125
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,880
really slow it'll it'll make it on much

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
much longer but it also has this

127
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,670
interesting effect to it

128
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,129
[Music]

129
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,860
so kind of interesting there's probably

130
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,129
some interesting things you can do with

131
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,289
that but these are just kind of fun like

132
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,729
effects you can apply an echo we'll do

133
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,259
that in the next video we'll do it some

134
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,439
echo works better with voice and we'll

135
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,169
do Equalization the next video - reverb

136
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,900
kind of gives it a little bit of a echo

137
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,420
too

138
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,190
[Music]

139
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,560
so it's almost like applying an echo and

140
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,690
but we can change you know how it sounds

141
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,300
it almost it's almost like applying an

142
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,070
echo just keeping that reverb bounce

143
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,270
back sound to our audio

144
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,419
another thing similar to that is our I

145
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,039
just thought a bit distortion so we can

146
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,349
apply distortion to this so we can

147
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,610
actually play back this while we're

148
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,210
changing it to

149
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,700
[Music]

150
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,660
oh there it is

151
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,400
so this is actually pretty much a lot

152
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,229
has a lot of distortion anyway just the

153
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:51,419
nature of the instruments being used in

154
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,879
it but what else effects yeah that's all

155
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,930
oh look at this wah

156
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,830
which is kind of cool too

157
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,470
[Music]

158
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,590
just creates kind of like a wah effect

159
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,550
so there's some different kinds of fun

160
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,199
effects that we can play with in there I

161
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,930
think you get the idea so oh and if we

162
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,270
we've got some more down here too by the

163
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,430
way

164
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,020
so we'll play some of these later too

165
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,930
but just know that you can click on

166
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,370
these arrows and you can scroll down and

167
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,120
see other options too that are not

168
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
necessarily visible depending on your

169
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,219
screen resolution so I appreciate you

170
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,210
watching this video hopefully found

171
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,889
informative just kind of a fun one just

172
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,180
playing with the effects and getting

173
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,129
maybe more familiar with them just so

174
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,719
you know what tools are available in

175
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:46,830
case you want to apply them in the

176
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,569
future go ahead and like comment
