00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,450
tutorial in this video I want to quickly

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,879
show you how to add markers to a file

4
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:10,619
you're working with an audacity or you

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,690
can also do this one live recording over

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,249
on the YouTube channel Brody Hansen

7
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,679
asked about this how to add markers

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,150
during an interview so they know how to

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,160
quickly jump to certain questions in

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,630
that interview so I'll show you how to

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,970
do that it's actually just a ctrl M on

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,890
your keyboard so if we play back this

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,079
file we can hit ctrl M on the keyboard

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,910
and every time we do that holding down

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,100
ctrl and pressing the M key will add a

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,700
marker down here on our audio file we

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,770
can then pause and we can zoom in here

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,510
or we can just click on Maya please do

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,100
min so we can zoom and look at these

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,990
markers and we know that during these

21
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,070
points we can call this you know soft

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,560
part of the song you're right and then

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,830
like building or whatever kind of notes

24
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,120
we want to have we can come and add them

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,550
in here I'm gonna show you - if we just

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,470
go ahead and then we can just clear all

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,739
this out we can delete these and we can

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,520
record a new track this is my so

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,170
question number one and we've add the

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,790
marker there how do you feel about this

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,740
a little bit of blah okay question

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,260
number two add marker you know what's

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,450
your favorite food so this is the

34
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,280
interview then we just come down here we

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,170
hit ctrl M on the keyboard to create

36
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,230
these and then we just title it question

37
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,480
number one and then go to the next one

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,770
title it question number two so fairly

39
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,390
simple just need to know the shortcut

40
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,300
key ctrl M and then you can zoom out

41
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,890
really far and be able to jump to your

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,600
questions very quickly not sure if we

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,970
can I think if we click on these we

44
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,500
could we can move them around to once

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,760
they're already placed by left clicking

46
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,920
and dragging

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,140
oh and cool we can highlight a selection

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,760
as well I didn't realize that so if we

49
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,680
go to the end part of it we can move it

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,340
but we can also say this question is

51
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,320
this duration so everything spanning

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,360
here is question number two so we could

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,490
even overlap certain markers can overlap

54
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,650
each other anyway a really useful tool

55
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,630
when using audacity hopefully that helps

56
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,939
and go ahead and leave your questions or

57
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,769
comments below if you have any and look

58
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,250
forward to catching you in the next

59
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,430
