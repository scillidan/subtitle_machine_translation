00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,980
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,930
tutorial in this video I'll show you how

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,360
to remove background noise from your

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,419
audio recording or from a music file and

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,459
so I'm just going to play this I've

6
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,679
created a sample file for you to listen

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,689
to that we can work off of so I'm going

8
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:28,470
to play it and you'll see what I mean so

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,089
you see we get all this noise if I left

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,589
click and select this we can play just

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,330
some here kind of this background noise

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,910
that's just kind of constant so this is

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,090
what we want to get rid of so luckily

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,790
there's an effect in audacity to do this

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,100
so we go to effects and it's called

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,180
noise reduction so if we go to noise

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,830
reduction without having anything

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,510
selected we go to effect and we go to

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,670
noise reduction we see it says you need

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,380
to select some audio so you might think

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,760
at first well let's just select

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,030
everything ctrl a this is not the way to

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,319
do it by the way I'm just showing you

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,970
what you might intuitively try and do

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,160
you go to noise reduction and we see

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,690
there's actually different steps we have

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,080
step 1 and step 2 so step one says

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,500
select a few seconds of just noise so

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,480
I'd acid he knows what to filter out and

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,720
then click get profile noise so we don't

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,070
want to click this right now because

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,650
otherwise it'll select the entire audio

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,370
as it'll think that's the noise so

34
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,900
instead what we want to do is just

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,120
select a part that we know is noise so

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,979
we'll and the longer the better on this

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,090
so we'll just click play so that's some

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,440
good noise there wasn't click in there I

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,580
don't know if that will affect us or not

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,049
or we could try this one at the end

41
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,979
maybe it's better good that's just

42
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,770
constant good noise so then we go back

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,350
to effects and we go to noise reduction

44
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,340
and now since only noise is selected we

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,760
can say get nose noise profile so when

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,130
we click this it'll get a profile adjust

47
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,990
this part to selective so we just we get

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,880
it and it just goes away and doesn't say

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,890
anything but it's got it and it's

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,159
remembered and recorded that now we can

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,810
select everything so we can double click

52
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,650
or we can go

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,980
control a to select everything and we

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,319
can go to effects and we can go to noise

55
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,599
reduction again now we can work off of

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,849
step two because it already has saved in

57
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,180
its memory a nose profile of that noise

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,459
and so now we can come in here and make

59
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,079
some different adjustments so I've

60
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,609
already changed I think by default this

61
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,120
was down at 12 for me so this might be

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,829
your default so go to preview and I'll

63
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,090
just play back and you'll hear what it

64
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,140
sounds like so that's better than it was

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,019
I think this is kind of how it was zero

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,150
is kind of like your baseline but if we

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,700
if we bring this up to maybe 16 and do

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,970
preview that sounds a lot better so we

69
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,389
can keep bringing this up and that noise

70
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,849
gets softer and softer one risk we have

71
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,639
is we want to kind of make sure that

72
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,280
it's not affecting the way our my voice

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,870
sounds let's hit preview here and listen

74
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,950
that's actually pretty good so I'm just

75
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,230
gonna hit OK now and look it gets rid of

76
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,090
that noise so now if we go back to the

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:30,989
beginning and play that's pretty good

78
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,819
it's a lot better than was before so

79
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,040
listen to this this is where our noise

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,220
was if we hit play now it's very quiet

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,949
if I do control Z and play that we'll

82
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,400
see it's loud again so that is

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,010
effectively using noise reduction you

84
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,709
just have to get a noise profile first

85
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,500
we go to noise reduction and then while

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,310
that selected get profile and then we go

87
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,099
to select everything effects and apply

88
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,989
it so kind of two steps there kind of

89
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,940
play with it and you know if you if you

90
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,310
accidentally keep this part selected and

91
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,430
you go to effects and we go to noise

92
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,010
reduction it will only do a noise

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,190
reduction on that part of the selection

94
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,108
and everything else will still we see

95
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,488
this is still noise over here there's

96
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,620
still noise where I'm talking but this

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,320
is like quiet because our selection

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
wasn't made properly so just make sure

99
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,930
when you apply it you have everything

100
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,849
selected and when you get the profile

101
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,570
you only

102
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,110
the noise selected well that's what I

103
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,130
want to share with you just a quick

104
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,430
quick introduction to the noise

105
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,950
reduction tool hopefully you found this

106
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,090
informative go ahead and like comment
