00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,810
tutorial in this video I'm going to show

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,969
you how to record the sound from your

4
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,619
computer so if you're playing music on

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,119
your computer you're watching something

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,789
online on Netflix or on YouTube you can

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,710
actually capture that audio that's

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,330
coming out of your computer playing

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,589
through your speakers or on your

10
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,320
headphones so basically anything on your

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,900
speakers you can record an audacity to

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,429
do that though you'll notice under the

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,740
microphone we have to change so that

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,859
we're listening to our audio card on our

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,420
computer and not listening to the

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,280
microphone so right now if I hit record

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,530
I'm recording from my microphone only

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,060
and if we come here to audio file under

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,350
music I have like this audio file it's a

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,070
MIDI so we can hear it but if we hit

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,420
record it didn't if we hit record now if

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,580
we play this back but if we hit record

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,740
see it didn't catch the audio from the

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,040
speaker's even though you heard it in my

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,990
in this tutorial we didn't capture it on

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,120
audacity so to change that what we need

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,910
to do let's just go file new let's bring

28
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,250
up a whole brand new window we go to

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,220
edit we go to preferences and under this

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,860
host yours might be different and in

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,750
fact this these instructions will

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,310
probably only work on windows now that I

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,350
think about it but we need to change our

34
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,840
host to this wasa API windows so if we

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,390
change that in here then under recording

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,860
we get some different options we still

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,990
have our microphone but we also have

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,750
this speakers we have a loopback I have

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,150
2 X 2 I have one for my rode microphone

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,010
but I just have this regular speaker

41
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,780
slash headphone and it's my real Tech

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,350
audio so real Tech's a common audio

43
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,170
interface so I'm gonna select this and

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,920
now when I say ok now when I record

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,440
first of all if I hit record right now

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,180
testing testing 1 2 3

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,790
nothing's happening if we hit stop it

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,770
doesn't record anything at all because

49
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,470
there's nothing playing there's no input

50
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,449
at all on this these speakers and

51
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,139
headphones but now if I go and actually

52
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,010
play some audio

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,900
so now we actually have this it was

54
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,290
there we go

55
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,240
so now we actually have this audio that

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,590
we've captured and we can play it in

57
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,750
audacity so we can let's see yeah

58
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:42,100
so let's hit play here okay there was a

59
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,840
little bit of a hiccup on capturing that

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,400
so this is actually doing a lot of

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,440
interesting things this is playback this

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,390
is a MIDI file being played back and

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,280
then we're recording it so actually it's

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,510
actually stepping through a whole bunch

65
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,920
of different audio settings on the

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,010
computer the different audio processes

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,030
but there you have it and we can do the

68
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,500
same thing if I come to the end of this

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,980
we want to go we just hit let's play a

70
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,630
YouTube video here like there's one of

71
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:12,850
my youtube videos and hit record so it's

72
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,320
actually recording what's happening on

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,320
the video here and then we can close

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,080
this hit stop here and we see it's

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,360
actually recorded this different audio

76
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,320
so we just we just recorded audio from a

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,020
YouTube video and from a MIDI file being

78
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,630
playback on our computer so that's how

79
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,560
you would do that and so just make sure

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,330
you can change this and if you don't

81
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,560
have an option to record from your

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,390
speakers or headphone or sometimes it's

83
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,580
called the name of your audio interface

84
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,000
then just go to edit preferences and you

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
might need to change your host to

86
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
something different and I'm on Linux and

87
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
Mac I think on Linux you can use do it

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,490
by default at least on depending on your

89
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,840
what distribution you're using on Mac

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm not exactly sure I'm going to change

91
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,240
mine back here but yeah that's how you

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,720
do it

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,240
I guess one more thing I'll say if you

94
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,770
need to if they're still not working you

95
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,300
can always right-click down here where

96
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,830
you adjust your volume you can right

97
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,290
click and then you can go to open sound

98
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,060
settings and you might have some

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,260
different options you can play around

100
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,780
with in here as well to choose like your

101
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,690
your to father if you're if you're still

102
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,010
not able to record you might just need

103
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,240
to go into your sound setting this is

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,950
what I'm saying and you can maybe play

105
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,600
around with changing different things

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,740
there to see if you can get it to work

107
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,510
so I hope you found this video

108
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,020
informative go ahead and like comments

109
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,000
scribe and I hope to see you in the next

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,210
