00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,860
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,720
tutorial in this video I'll show you how

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,929
to increase or decrease the volume of a

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,079
imported music file or sound file or of

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,909
a file that you've recorded as an audio

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,110
that you've captured or recorded

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,029
yourself so to get started I'm just

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,009
going to drag and drop in an actual

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,779
audio file we'll do this one of this

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,880
jazz guitar just left-click and drag it

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,699
in and then we see the audio file here

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,019
if we click we can play and listen to

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,660
what it sounds like and audio add so if

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,280
we want to increase the the volume of

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
this we've learned in the past we can

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,690
just increase the gain over here and

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,070
this will actually affect the final

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,440
output we can also just turn like the

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,450
volume up on our computer which is what

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,610
this knob up here is doing if we change

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,920
it up here it changes just the output

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,810
volume of our computer so that's

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,310
actually not that's gonna help us hear

24
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,500
it better but just know that's not going

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,830
to change the final output of this file

26
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,350
and also when we change over here we see

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,730
the wave doesn't change at all

28
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,620
so if we want to change the way the wave

29
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,970
looks like actually amplify the the wave

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,530
what we need to do is go up to effects

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,370
and go to amplify and when we just do it

32
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,659
just like this it's not gonna let us do

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,800
anything because it says you have no

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,250
selection so by default audacity doesn't

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,470
assume that we want to just amplify the

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,320
entire audio file it wants us to choose

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,150
so we could say just amplify this

38
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,700
portion if we left click and drag and

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,110
highlight we can highlight a certain

40
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,170
part of it or we can press ctrl-a to

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,800
select all another way to select all is

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,470
to go up to select and click all so

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,710
let's select all we can go select none

44
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,900
we can select by track we only have one

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,690
track right now but let's go select all

46
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,270
and now that everything selected we can

47
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,280
go back to effects and go to amplify and

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
now it brings up this window here so

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
audio levels are measured in decibels

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,180
this DB and so this is this is gonna

51
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,799
amplify it by seven decibels right now

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,380
if we had this set to zero there'd be no

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,420
amplification so the zero is kind of the

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,950
neutral point right now if I say okay

55
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,239
nothing happens everything looks the

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,430
same it's not any louder or any softer

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,620
but control a to select everything again

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,470
if we go to effects amplify and if we

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,420
have it above zero it's going to amplify

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,700
it make it louder if we have it below

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,550
zero in the negative it's going to make

62
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,010
it softer quieter

63
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,180
so let's come up to list it was here by

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,190
default like I've said a seven basically

65
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,959
it was I think to almost its height like

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,750
the highest it could possibly amplify it

67
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,030
until it starts clipping the audio

68
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,160
remember clipping is when the wave goes

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,610
above the very top above this 100% so if

70
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,230
we go any high we can click OK now but

71
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,970
if we go any higher than this it's gonna

72
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,459
get grayed out and we can't click OK

73
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,260
unless we check this box here it says

74
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,660
allow clipping but so let's just come

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,829
down we'll come down to about maybe

76
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,560
right here and we'll click OK and then

77
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,620
we see our wave it gets larger and we

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,190
can actually play and it's a louder

79
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,840
volume now we can see up in our activity

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,290
up here that it's louder if we wanted to

81
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,090
undo that and maybe we want to change it

82
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,209
we used to control Z to undo or we can

83
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,049
use these undo and redo buttons up here

84
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,430
let's select everything again and this

85
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,019
time let's try to make it softer so we

86
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,019
go to effects amplify and then we'll

87
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,109
change it let's go down to maybe that

88
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,810
same extreme maybe I can negative 5 or 6

89
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,660
and we'll go okay so now it's kind of

90
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,030
much much more quiet and soft so this is

91
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,040
actually adjusting the way that's

92
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,319
actually modifying the actual sound the

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,840
wave that makes up the sound and either

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,950
making it louder or softer so that's a

95
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,510
quick introduction and this is actually

96
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,310
the direction to using effects in

97
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,470
general so we'll do this the same way if

98
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,700
we want to apply you can read through

99
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,019
some of the some of these other effects

100
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,130
and we'll be jumping through a lot of

101
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,889
them in the next tutorials but just

102
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:11,819
remember you have to have everything

103
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,500
selected and I guess let's just try that

104
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,320
for now if we want to have just this one

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,970
portion of the song

106
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,100
this part right here if we want to make

107
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,080
just this loud we can just have this

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,880
selected like we do and then go to

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,700
effects amplify and then we can make it

110
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,290
loud and that's actually let's bring it

111
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,480
clear up here and let's go allow

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,140
clipping so this is going to Phi this

113
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,820
incredibly loud so loud that it actually

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,170
comes above the total at the top of this

115
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,020
like the of the part that we can see so

116
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,690
we go okay and now look how that's just

117
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,910
crazy that's gonna be loud and ugly I'll

118
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,650
do the anti so it's not too out for us

119
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,870
so you can see it's distorted it's

120
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,940
clipped that's louder than we would want

121
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,190
and something I want to show if we were

122
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,350
to highlight this now and we're like oh

123
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,600
it's the if we want to undo that change

124
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,750
we should click undo but if we want to

125
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,100
do it the wrong way we go back to

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,690
amplify and be like let's take it back

127
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,300
down to try and correct it but now look

128
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,730
what happens if we do that and then

129
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,080
we're like oh that's too small and then

130
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,790
we go to effect amplify again to try and

131
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,070
change it what we're gonna see is if we

132
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,560
look at this wave now look how look at

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,890
it it's like all just flat and ugly so

134
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,590
if we zoom in here here we can just

135
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,120
select it and I click this button here

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,790
so it seems into the total selection so

137
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,320
it's just look it's completely square

138
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,360
now it's a lot different than it was

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,669
before because we've messed around with

140
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,560
it and we amplified it and then put it

141
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
down so if ever you wanted to make

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,780
changes the way to to reverse an

143
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,300
amplification is just to do the undo not

144
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,490
to come back in here and lower the level

145
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,440
or raise the level after the fact does

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,030
that make sense so if I want to get this

147
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,770
back to how it was originally I just

148
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,340
push back and back and back until we get

149
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,010
back to the original hopefully found

150
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,330
this video informative that's using

151
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,530
amplification go ahead and play with

152
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,000
that we can also use it on our own

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,050
recorded audio and yeah that's basically

154
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,270
using the amplification effect go ahead

155
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,740
and LIKE comment subscribe and I'll see

156
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,340
you in the next video
