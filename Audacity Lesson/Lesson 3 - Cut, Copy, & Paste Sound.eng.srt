00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,860
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,779
tutorial in this video I'm just going to

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,579
go to the file open

4
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,650
we're gonna bring in some audio I'll do

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,659
this more jazz guitar it's a wav file

6
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,579
and I'm going to show you how to use cut

7
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,310
copy and paste and move sections of your

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,439
audio around so let's just play this and

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,480
listen to see what we have here so just

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,970
an audio recording of some acoustic

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,539
guitar so let's say I really only want I

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,280
really like this part if I left click

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,990
here in stand play from here I really

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,560
like what it sounds like here but I

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,580
didn't I don't want this intro part so

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,480
we know we've learned in the past

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,820
tutorial we can left-click and keep our

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,230
left-click down and select by moving so

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,550
we can select this part and just hit the

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,930
Delete key if you want to get rid of it

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,570
but maybe we have some timing issues

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,520
it's like part of a video and we want to

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
keep the timing intact

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
I can go edit undo we can actually just

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
create silence for this part we can

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,559
select the whole thing and if we hover

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,350
over here this icon says silence audio

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,840
selection if we hit this it just creates

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,100
silence there but it doesn't actually

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,890
delete it so if we want to remove a

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,540
portion of the audio without actually

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,120
cutting out that section just use this

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,490
silence tool so we can silence any part

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,870
of this audio we want to and it creates

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,850
a silent lion and then when we play that

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,170
portion it'll just be silent until it

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,229
gets there so that's how you can keep

38
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,360
timing intact to get that to come back

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,500
we can go edit undo edit undo edit undo

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,780
you can also have the ctrl Z on the

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,350
keyboard to undo we could let's say we

42
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,580
like this portion we just don't want it

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,409
to be at the beginning we want to be at

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,840
the end we can select it like it was now

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,180
so select all this and then we can go to

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,549
kept here the cut icon is right up here

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,440
to a pair of scissors we can click cut

48
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,750
and now it goes away so it's kind of

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,850
like delete except that it saves that

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,460
section in our clipboard and we can then

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,920
paste it so if we want to paste it at

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,449
the wherever we want to paste it we can

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,219
just click it's a font to paste at the

54
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,079
end we left-click get our playhead there

55
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:13,620
or this

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
black wine and then we just go to paste

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,780
which is this icon of the clipboard so

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,620
click paste

59
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,500
now that section appears here so now if

60
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,280
we play at the beginning it just starts

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,629
like this and then it plays this end

62
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:34,200
part at the end we can also play it if

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,430
we wanted to play at the beginning and

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,310
at the end we can select it and we can

65
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,680
use the copy so this icon here like two

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,690
pages looks like kind of like we click

67
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,760
that and that copies and then we can go

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,859
back to the first and hit paste again

69
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,959
and what paste does you'll notice it

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,849
actually just sort of like makes a cut

71
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,040
and then inserts it in there

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
it's not going to paste overtop of any

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,680
of the audio ahead of it unless we

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,569
wanted it to if we want to replace let's

75
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,159
say we want to replace this section of

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,810
audio with this clip we just select that

77
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,430
portion that we want to replace and then

78
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,329
we well I do so I just want to show that

79
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,349
we still have this in our clipboard

80
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,359
because when we copy we can paste

81
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,919
multiple times let's copy it again and

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,299
let you so we know that we have it in

83
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,680
our clipboard and now we can select this

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,290
and go paste and it will replace this

85
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,340
portion oops I hit copy instead ctrl C

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,139
also does that and then we come over

87
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,000
here we can hit control V or just the

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,090
paste icon and that will change what was

89
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,829
there to this sound here and now it

90
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,310
sounds like this

91
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,480
if we want this to just repeat over and

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,969
over again we can select this we go to

93
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,670
copy or control C on the keyboard and

94
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,030
then we can just click right before it

95
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,269
can go ctrl V to paste click ctrl V

96
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,670
click ctrl V now we're going to play

97
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:08,120
this section four times in a row so go

98
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,049
ahead and play with some of those I

99
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,159
think you're kind of getting the idea I

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,639
hope so we can select and we can cut we

101
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,880
can select something and we can copy it

102
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,470
at any point if we just click we can

103
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,389
paste and if we select anything within

104
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,160
our selection when we go to paste

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,000
we'll get deleted basically and then the

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,130
part that we want to paste will paste

107
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,710
overtop of all this so now that's gone

108
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,650
and this is pasted here instead so play

109
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,460
with that one more thing I want to show

110
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,930
you if we just want to keep a certain

111
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,669
part of the song if we only wanted to

112
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,380
keep like this section right here this

113
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,440
short little piece we just want that

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,720
sound we want everything else to be gone

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,550
there's an icon right here we can click

116
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,830
on i'm just called trim audio outside of

117
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,229
selection if we click this everything

118
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,789
after it goes away everything before

119
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:03,680
goes away and we just have this the only

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,610
issue was doing this is it maintains the

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,050
that portion of the song that it's apps

122
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,150
or the timing so this is being played at

123
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,490
about eleven and a half seconds in so

124
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,840
it'll be a bunch of silence if we go

125
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,280
back to the beginning of the composition

126
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,349
hit play we should have all the silence

127
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,400
forever until it gets to over here so to

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,260
change that we could actually use our

129
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,300
time shift tools like we've learned and

130
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,680
we can come over here while time shift

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,430
is selected

132
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,070
left click on it and move it back to the

133
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,169
beginning where we want it to be and now

134
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,340
when we go to the beginning of the audio

135
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,550
and play go play properly otherwise if

136
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,930
it was over here it'd be fine

137
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,240
but when we go to file and export and

138
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,090
save it the the listener or wherever we

139
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,500
use this it'll have a bunch of empty

140
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,210
space at the beginning which is not

141
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,020
usually ideal for audio I think we're

142
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,400
gonna end this tutorial here go ahead

143
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,590
and play with cut copy and paste just

144
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,520
know that you can also do

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,169
under the Edit section you can always

146
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,479
cut there so if we select I'm sure your

147
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,009
selection tool is selected we can go

148
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,240
edit cut and then we can go edit paste

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,039
so there's three ways to do it really

150
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,919
the icons here using the edit menu then

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,780
also the shortcut keys control X control

152
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,729
V to paste and ctrl C to copy I'm just

153
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,470
hitting ctrl V over and over again to

154
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,900
paste all these different sections I

155
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,590
hope you found this video informative
