00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,630
tutorial in this video I just want to go

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,890
over a couple more effects that's gonna

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,070
help our audio to sound better and also

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,799
to work with silence and noise so I

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,900
recorded here some audio and we see just

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,939
by looking at it it's about 32 seconds

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,310
long and it has a bunch of empty space

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,490
empty silence in the beginning if we

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,099
just hit play it's empty over here

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,599
I'm just like is this thing on

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,710
I'm just kind of like testing and has

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,890
some silence in here okay we're starting

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,950
okay we're starting now okay got it so

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,990
what I can do actually if you ever have

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,460
an audio file like this and sometimes

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,710
it'll be like an hour long there's

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,620
actually a nice effect or a nice tool in

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,680
audacity to remove all this silence what

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,210
we do we just double click anywhere to

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,760
select everything or press ctrl-a or go

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,190
to edit we're going to select all once

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,110
everything is all selected go to effects

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,700
and then we go to truncate silence and

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,750
this brings up we have some different

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,060
options but I just leave it leave it the

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,920
same unless you need to adjust it to try

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
and then we just go to okay and look it

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,860
actually cuts out all that silence so

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,750
instead of being 30 seconds long now

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,940
it's only 11 seconds long so it

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,620
automatically detected any where there

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,470
was a big gap of silence and then cut it

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,600
out cut most of it out it left some gaps

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,780
of silence in here otherwise our audio

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,430
would just like run right in together to

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:29,940
each other

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,590
but now we can play and see what this

39
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,780
sounds like are we on is this thing

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,370
recording is this thing on

41
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,170
okay we're starting okay we're starting

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,440
now okay so I said the same thing over

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,940
and over again but it's didn't sound

44
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,950
quite so strange when I had a bunch of

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,799
gaps in between alright but now what we

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
can do we can take this audio and so

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,979
this part this first part actually I

48
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,240
didn't even play for you yet so maybe I

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,540
want to apply like a nice effect to just

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,299
this a nice echo effect so we go to

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,700
effect so we go down to echo and we can

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,680
actually say we can say delay this 0.1

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,249
seconds we can preview

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,860
so we can do that I'll just say okay so

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,030
that gives us sort of like this an

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,130
interesting effect we did this a little

57
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,720
bit earlier to under effects we can also

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,450
go to reverb

59
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,860
this will make it sound like I'm in like

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,290
a big a big room we'll just leave all

61
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,400
that the rest the same but just know you

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,680
can play with this quite a bit and so

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,110
[Music]

64
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,160
another thing I should show you here

65
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,610
what was it oh yeah okay of course so

66
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,320
this makes it sound like I'm in like a

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,510
big hall kind of if I want to change

68
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,000
some of this here to sound like I can

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,410
select all this part here and let's go

70
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,920
to effects we can go to equalization and

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,360
there's a bunch of different profiles

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,010
here so if you're not familiar with this

73
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,840
it's kind of outside the scope of this

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,130
video and actually I don't do a whole

75
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,590
lot with this but I know like there's

76
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,590
different frequencies of the audio and

77
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,970
we can change different portions of it

78
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,740
so a lot of times you'll see like this

79
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,270
will be like a lot of our base over here

80
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,830
and this will be like a lot of our

81
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,830
treble so we can change this to affect

82
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,140
the way that musics going to sound but

83
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,470
there's also some pre-selected curves

84
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,970
for like AM radio this kind of gives

85
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,890
that effect of an AM radio which is like

86
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,050
not much bass at all not much trouble at

87
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,040
all and it sounds more like this

88
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,680
recording which you might not not notice

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,940
a big difference there this is like

90
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,830
walkie talkie which is even more extreme

91
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,720
so you know that effect of talking into

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,970
a walkie talkie just sounds like very

93
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,990
kind of like hollow and like shallow sea

94
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,060
and we can even get more we can if we

95
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,490
affect this a little bit we can even get

96
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,140
more of that effect by just going like

97
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,050
that C sounds like GI Joe kind of

98
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:04,680
talking into the radio anyway and so we

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,030
can we can go okay we can actually

100
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,489
change that wave to to be that effect so

101
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,709
just know under here Equalization you

102
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,880
can change a lot you can have some

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,180
different presets bass boost will just

104
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,339
sigh boost the bass of course we got

105
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,829
treble boost boost is the treble and so

106
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,690
some different things we can do here

107
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,790
and then also we've got effects

108
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,520
normalize will kind of just normalize

109
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,930
our audio and there's some different

110
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,340
sayings we can leave it we can preview

111
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,790
and see what it sounds like so it

112
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,260
actually makes our audio sound a lot

113
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,120
better it takes our wave and just kind

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,890
of averages and it's called

115
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,140
normalization but even though with that

116
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,000
walkie-talkie it makes our just our

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,790
audio sound a lot better so those are a

118
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,680
few things you can do you normalize your

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,330
audio play with the equalization of

120
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,280
course supply like effects and different

121
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
probably not so much echo but the reverb

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,420
can give it if you do it subtly the

123
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,360
reverb can just give a nice little

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,940
subtle effect if we take it down and you

125
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,860
know have some of this stuff not be just

126
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,450
kind of gives it more of a feel of like

127
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,720
a more of a presence yeah that's why I'm

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,860
going to share with you in this video

129
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,020
just a quick one go and play with those

130
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,640
get familiar with them and I'll catch

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,330
you in the next video
