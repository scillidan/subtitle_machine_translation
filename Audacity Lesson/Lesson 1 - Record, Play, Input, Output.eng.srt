1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
in this tutorial series will be using

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,710
audacity the free audio recording and

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,900
editing software and I'm going to be

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,099
showing you how to use it kind of

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,570
exploring the interface a little bit and

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,039
showing you some different things you

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,719
can do with it so it should be a fun

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,090
tutorial series and I'm glad you found

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,920
it if you don't already have audacity

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,119
installed you can check out my other

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,429
video it is legitimately free

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,080
open-source software you can download

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,089
and use it it's not a free trial version

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,130
or there's no tricks involved this is

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,570
just great free software that you can

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,570
use to create podcasts to record

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,510
instruments interviews I'm using it to

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,310
do my tutorial videos to record the

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,770
audio for some of my tutorials it's just

20
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,850
great free software and it's

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,740
full-featured so go ahead and get that

22
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,060
downloaded installed and then come back

23
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,100
to these tutorials I'm using it on

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,170
Windows 10 it works on Linux and Mac as

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,210
well the first thing you want to do when

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,060
it's first installed is to go ahead and

27
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,680
just try and do a test recording just

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,030
right out the gate hit this record

29
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,560
button and then when you're done hit the

30
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
stop button so I'm just gonna do that

31
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,550
this is a test audio recording and then

32
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,100
we just hit play this is a test audio

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,110
recording so the fact that we can play

34
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,490
that back and listen to it the fact that

35
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,650
we see these blue waveforms appear down

36
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,630
here tells me that my microphone is

37
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,670
working and that my speakers are working

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,530
so if you hit record and you just have a

39
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,510
solid blue line and you don't see any

40
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,760
activity even when you're talking that's

41
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,500
just saying that audacity doesn't know

42
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,650
what input device to use it doesn't it's

43
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,870
not or it doesn't the input device

44
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,280
you've told it to use isn't working

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,050
properly that could mean you might have

46
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,729
a switch on your a lot of times a

47
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,650
headset with a built-in microphone will

48
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,240
have a switch that you can turn on and

49
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,159
off to toggle if your microphones on or

50
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,560
off obviously your microphone has to be

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,630
plugged into your computer if you want

52
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,370
to use the webcam microphone that's

53
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,880
built into like a laptop you specify all

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
that and to do that if we hover over

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,270
here and look we see we have a

56
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,760
microphone symbol and a speaker symbol

57
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,070
and we can actually change what we're

58
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,799
using as our default device so I was

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,020
recording using my rode microphone my

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,080
USB mic but if I were to use this which

61
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,430
is my webcam my HD webcam HD pro webcam

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,380
I can actually come here to the

63
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,960
this recording and hit record again this

64
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,810
is a test audio recording and we see the

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,100
wave looks different and it's gonna

66
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,630
sound a lot different too if we play

67
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,090
back one is using my rode microphone and

68
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,100
one is using my webcam microphone this

69
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,470
is a test audio recording recording so

70
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,240
you can change the input that you're

71
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,430
using on this tab if you use this

72
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,650
Microsoft sound mapper that basically

73
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,360
just means if I right-click down here

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,100
and go to open sound settings that

75
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,360
basically means whatever you're telling

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,370
Windows to use as your default device

77
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,430
use that so my default device is my rode

78
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,590
microphone so using Microsoft sound

79
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,080
mapper and using my rode microphone

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,350
option are gonna have the same result so

81
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,570
over here under speakers it has the same

82
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,910
option we can say use Microsoft sound

83
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,250
mapper so whatever your your control

84
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,950
panel settings are set up for - for your

85
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,440
audio that's just what it'll it'll do so

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,240
that's that might be your best option

87
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,940
try that at first there's a couple

88
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,200
different ways to configure it but I'm

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,510
using my speakers and headphones as my

90
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,270
playback device it's just my real tech

91
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,510
built-in audio interface that's built

92
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,730
into the computer I have an option also

93
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,830
to use my rode microphone as an output

94
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,720
device because my microphone has a

95
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,000
headphone jack on it that I could use

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,470
but I don't have any headphones plugged

97
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,850
in right now and so if I try and play

98
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,450
this it's playing but I'm not hearing

99
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,280
the audio that's because I'm using the

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,020
wrong output device or I'm using an

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,790
output device that doesn't have anything

102
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,980
plugged into it right now so just play

103
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,209
around with those to get your right

104
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,100
configuration to actually record and

105
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,020
hear something another way to get in to

106
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,670
looking at these is to go to edit and go

107
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,980
down to preferences and then the first

108
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,650
tab here is devices and you can change

109
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,930
it here it's the exact same options it's

110
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,250
just a different way to look at it and

111
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,420
it gives you a little bit more options

112
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,550
as far as you can change this host so

113
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,660
you might need to change that but I'm

114
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,160
just leaving mine mine hadn't happened

115
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
to work and this is some of these

116
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,730
options are gonna look different for you

117
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,800
you're not gonna have rode microphone

118
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,150
unless you have a rode microphone

119
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,880
plugged in yours might be you know

120
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,470
whatever manufacturer of microphone

121
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,810
you're using the name of your speakers

122
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,070
and microphones will be different than

123
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,810
mine but just know that sometimes you

124
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,890
have to play with those to get it to

125
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,530
work properly

126
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,270
that's the extent of x-ray this tutorial

127
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,499
I'm just going to show you and in the

128
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,289
next one we'll actually learn how to do

129
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,639
some more with this we'll learn more

130
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,080
about what this interface is and what's

131
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,669
going on but I appreciate you watching

132
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,139
this video I hope it's helped to get

133
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,210
your configure your audio audacity

134
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,789
configured properly and in the next

135
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,710
video we'll start learning how to record

136
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,930
audio and edit audio thanks for watching
