00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,810
tutorial in this video I want to talk

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,389
about monitoring your audio and what to

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,160
look for to know if your audio is too

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,650
low or too high or good quality or bad

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,470
quality so I want if you look up here

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,300
under R we have a microphone and a

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,330
speaker's kind of button it says click

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,990
to start monitoring if we click up here

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,699
we notice we start seeing some levels so

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,349
I'm talking right now and as I talk

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,320
these levels kind of go up and the

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,480
microphone I'm using to monitor here is

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,980
not the same microphone I'm talking into

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,500
for recording this audio the one

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,030
recording the audio on is this road mic

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,770
and the one that we're seeing right now

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,240
up here is our is my webcam microphone

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,490
and I can control the volume of this

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,220
over here by just clicking and dragging

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,960
this down so if I bring this down here

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,580
we see this doesn't go up quite as high

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,170
when I talk I bring it all the way down

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,870
it's pretty low now it's only kind about

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,390
halfway if I bring it all the way up we

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,300
see it goes this these bars go higher so

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,430
this is showing a representation of the

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,510
audio that we're recording also when I

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,370
when it's silent we see the noise floor

30
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,260
so we see how much ambient noise there

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,340
is happening you see that so it's just

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,470
some noise happening in the air in this

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,240
room that the buzzing of the computer or

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,860
buzzing of lights that's just the noise

35
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,810
that it's picking up there's a left and

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,190
a right channel that's why they're kind

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,020
of ones ahead of the other sometimes we

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,010
see left and right and this is too high

39
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,840
right now so I'm not recording but we

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,340
see this is pretty high too the fact

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,720
that that's going into orange and even

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,900
red if I were to clap my hands

43
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,550
it definitely Peaks out we can record

44
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,010
and see what that looks like so this is

45
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,479
recording I'm gonna come really close

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,220
and talk right into this microphone here

47
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,170
and we see it's like clipping

48
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,540
it's just too loud a good level for this

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,060
would be to come down here maybe set it

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,500
to right here so that it goes into the

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,510
yellow occasionally when things get

52
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,360
really loud it might barely start to

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,650
clip a little bit but we want to avoid

54
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,900
clipping I'm gonna hit stop here on this

55
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,390
recording so clipping is when if we come

56
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,619
over here to when I was really close

57
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,669
when the audio file goes up above this

58
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,590
1.0 point so it starts at 0

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,290
and then one is like 100% so if your

60
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,660
audio that you're recording is over 100%

61
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,660
level then you're going to experience

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,030
clipping which the top of this wave

63
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,129
clips a good healthy wave looks like

64
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,230
this you can see the very top of it and

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,879
you can see what the wave looks like if

66
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,260
we want to zoom in and look at like a

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,030
good healthy way we can highlight this

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,480
and then go to this click here it says

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,849
fit selection to width and we can just

70
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,160
see we can see the tops and we can see

71
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,599
the whole wave and there's space above

72
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,700
it if ever we come over and we see a

73
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,380
wave and there's not space above it like

74
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,230
this over here you see it's it's clipped

75
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,920
out part of the audio click here so we

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,930
can see that so these parts of the audio

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,410
are clipped and it sounds pretty bad too

78
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,720
when this happens so if we go back to

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,379
the beginning and play this see that

80
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,370
it's like all distorted and look at our

81
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,599
levels on our playback when we're

82
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,879
playing we can see basically our speaker

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,019
is showing the same thing that our

84
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,519
recording monitor was showing when we

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,230
recorded so we can we can go in and fix

86
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,819
this after the fact using different

87
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,000
effects but the best thing to do is just

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,519
record it right the first time and so

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,290
for example like if we want to just

90
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,750
lower the volume watch what'll happen we

91
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,579
can click here and we can turn down the

92
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,410
gain and that'll actually lower it

93
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,150
doesn't change the wave but it's gonna

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,380
make it much quieter when we playback so

95
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,120
it's like you can almost hardly hear it

96
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,829
but it's still distorted even though we

97
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,840
turned it down that the distortion still

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
there because we captured it with this

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,359
kind of crazy distortion this left and

100
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,620
right I want to show - on the audio

101
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,720
track just lets us control whether we're

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,180
using our left or right

103
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,889
whether that audio is coming out of the

104
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,530
left or the right ear just download it

105
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,470
so it's not so loud for you so this is

106
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,260
the left side this is the right side if

107
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,839
we hit record again oh wait let's go

108
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,279
back and hit record again a second time

109
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,250
Oh am i setting okay so nevermind

110
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,600
in the next video we'll look at adding

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
in a second track I think there's like a

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,289
setting up here we go to edit tracks we

113
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,150
go to add new stereo track and now we

114
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,009
have a new track down here so we can

115
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,620
have two tracks at once it used to be by

116
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,880
default that when you hit record it

117
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,470
would start on a second track and we can

118
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,150
change that setting but I'm not sure how

119
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,490
to do it exactly right now but so now we

120
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,889
can say we can record down in this track

121
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,350
so this is my second track so we can

122
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,330
have two audio playing overtop of audio

123
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,080
and then we can mute just this one or we

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
can solo and just play this one and mute

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,650
all the other tracks size of that mute

126
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,009
and solo is and then we can minimize the

127
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,360
track and kind of bring it down smaller

128
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,590
if we're working with lots of different

129
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,930
audio tracks you can change the size

130
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,919
that you're viewing it too well I hope I

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,120
didn't cover too much I hope I didn't

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,650
get down into crazy with this tutorial

133
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,849
but that's what I wanted to talk about

134
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,750
is just being aware of your levels and

135
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,979
recording good audio and just watching

136
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,930
that you're in that green watching that

137
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,419
you're recording a nice nice level right

138
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,120
here just in the green area not into the

139
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,020
yellow and also not too low here if it's

140
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,419
too low then your audio sounds you know

141
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,729
obviously too low but lower it's better

142
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,440
than higher too soft

143
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,449
we can always amplify and bring out some

144
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,490
of that audio too loud you're gonna get

145
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,710
distortion sounding and that's just no

146
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,320
good well I appreciate you watching this

147
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,479
video I hope that's been informative for

148
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,979
you go ahead and like subscribe comment

149
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,419
below and I'll catch you on the next one
