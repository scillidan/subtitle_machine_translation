00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,810
tutorial in this video I'll show you how

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,209
to work with multiple tracks and record

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,730
audio over top of existing audio and

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,469
play both at the same time maybe you

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,719
want to have a music playing at the

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,580
introduction of your podcast and then

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,259
you want to have your voice come in and

9
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,750
talk overtop of that music this is how

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,640
we can do that so let's say we want to

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,230
bring in music first we have this jazz

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,599
guitar music we looked at in the past we

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,050
can play it here what it sounds like but

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,250
if I want to record if I move my

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,870
playhead to a certain point and hit

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,600
record it starts recording my voice at

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,210
the end it like up ends my audio

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,110
recording to the end of this of this

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,540
track here so I'm gonna hit ctrl Z to

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,580
get rid of that and what we want to do

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,320
is actually add a second track if we hit

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,210
this little arrow here and minimize this

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,230
and we can see there's all kinds of

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,990
space here we could add more tracks so

25
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,280
to do that we kind of touched on it in

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,540
the last video a little bit at the end

27
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,810
we go to tracks add new and we'll go add

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,090
new stereo track so now we have another

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,860
track here we could minimize it as well

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,380
we can go track we can go add new stereo

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,670
track we can just get a bunch of

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,950
different tracks in here and then we can

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,720
expand whichever one we want to look at

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,730
these things have nothing in them and

35
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,590
then this is our music if you want to

36
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,450
get rid of a track we just select it and

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,159
while we have it selected we can go

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,820
tracks remove track if we want to remove

39
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,470
this audio track we can just hit here

40
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,480
close and will actually close and get

41
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,550
rid of remove that track as well and to

42
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,920
get it to come back we go edit undo

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,310
track remove and now it's back if I want

44
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,570
to record over top of this now I just

45
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,340
click down here in this track to where I

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,370
want to start recording and I hit record

47
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,620
it'll play the music and so I can hear

48
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,180
it and then I can talk and record in

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,229
this track hello welcome to the podcast

50
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,840
you can talk here overtop the music and

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,030
it's pretty cool

52
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,200
then hit stop and now we have two

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,650
separate different pieces of audio if we

54
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,270
want so if we play it play back now they

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,040
both play at the same time we can use

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,170
our time shift tool to move this forward

57
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,099
or back if we want it to come in at a

58
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,270
different point in the audio

59
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,780
hello welcome to the podcast we can

60
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,560
apply different effects to this and do

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,670
different things like that so yeah

62
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,500
that's basically it and then if we want

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,970
to adjust these tracks we can click this

64
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,060
here and we say move track up and now

65
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,070
that our audio track is our kind of top

66
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,720
track it doesn't really matter for as

67
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,320
far as how it's being played back if

68
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,050
this like this audio sounds like it's a

69
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,910
little bit loud for maybe me talking

70
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,720
here so we can lower the gain on it we

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,200
can do that while we're playing so it

72
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,360
doesn't change the actual wave form but

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,780
it does lower the volume in here also we

74
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,700
use like the envelope tool before which

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,950
is a good example for this we click the

76
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,620
envelope tool we can lower down so we

77
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,900
can have this audio be kind of loud here

78
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,640
then as soon as I get into the talking

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
point we can really make this audio get

80
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,830
really small and then as soon as I'm

81
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,270
done talking we can kind of bring it

82
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,380
back up loud again if we want to see

83
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,020
that so now if we play this that's one

84
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,300
way to do that in the next video we'll

85
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,850
talk about using the amplification

86
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,900
effect and using different effects

87
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,250
because we can actually use

88
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,750
amplification as well to change the

89
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,240
volume make it louder or softer but I

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,020
think I'm gonna end this video here

91
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,430
that's just using different tracks go

92
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,080
ahead and play with that get familiar

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,540
with adding in multiple tracks and try

94
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,340
and record some mute some audio overtop

95
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,030
of music yeah appreciate you watching

96
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,350
hopefully you found this informative go

97
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,670
ahead and like comment subscribe and

98
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,900
