00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,009
welcome back to another audacity

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,020
tutorial in this video we're going to be

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,389
looking at the vocoder effect within

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,129
audacity to create sort of like a

5
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,709
robotic voice and more or less I just

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,049
want to do this tutorial to show you

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,820
some things that we haven't yet covered

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,849
in audacity we working with tracks and

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,419
mono tracks but if you just want to

10
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:25,980
create the robotic voice audacity

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,929
actually isn't the best tool for that at

12
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,990
least not this vocoder plug-in or effect

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,880
but what you can do I'll include this

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,380
link here to this get covered right

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,580
github address for this vocoder sort of

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,670
tool that this guy wrote up Chris Wilson

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,670
it's really really awesome and so here's

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,380
the license for word it's actually it's

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,930
a some sort of open source I was reading

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,920
through you can read through the license

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,020
and see the uses for it but basically

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,160
it's really cool and we can check it out

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:05,610
here it's like what it sounds like so

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,030
you can you can actually upload your own

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,460
input file or we can talk into it live

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,220
like we can do this hello testing this

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,659
is TJ free so that's cool oops how do we

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,680
stop this goes out of that anyway so

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,510
include the link to that if you're

30
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,040
trying to if you're just wanting to do

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,420
that then cool you don't need to keep

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,070
watching this video but if you keep

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,090
watching this you're gonna learn some

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,350
things about audacity you might not have

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,850
known before so we're gonna try to use

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,820
audacity to create that same effect so

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,170
first of all we need to read in some

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,690
audio so to do that I was record this is

39
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,000
some audio that will make sound like I

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,340
say a robotic voice alright oh and I

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,060
lied first of all let's actually go to

42
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,620
tracks and we'll go add new because we

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,150
want this to be a mono track which means

44
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,740
there's not a left and a right channel

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,290
it's just a single channel this audio

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,530
will be in a robotic voice okay so we

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,790
just have a single channel now if yours

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,920
is to do what I did and hit the X there

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,590
to delete that that track and then go to

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,129
tracks add new mono track okay then in

51
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,230
addition to this we need to have what's

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,280
called a carrier

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,950
so this is like a carrier audio or

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,810
carrier wave that we're gonna kind of

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,040
mix together with this audio recording

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,470
to create the vocoder effect the robot

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,620
robotic voice effect so we're going to

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,730
generate like we've done in the past

59
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,200
tutorials we're just gonna generate a

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,140
tone and we can try some different ones

61
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,470
so the Sawtooths pretty good I'm going

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,959
to take this frequency down to maybe 240

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,720
and we'll take the amplitude amplitudes

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,250
fine let's try this

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,370
oh whoops control Z we need it to be on

66
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,620
its own track so let's add another track

67
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,239
in here for another mono track and then

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,610
we'll do that so we go generate and then

69
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,970
we go tone 240 that should be good and

70
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,970
we'll see how this sounds whoa oh my

71
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,489
goodness that's terrible right so that's

72
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,800
super high-pitched apologize about that

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,930
let's let's take this but we could we

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,070
could generate it differently but let's

75
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,010
just come here and we'll just slow this

76
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,850
speed like super super down okay so that

77
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,260
speeds and slowed down now and now if we

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,209
play it it might not be quite as quite

79
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,360
high-pitched okay perfect this is like

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,070
it's actually very low I'm gonna click

81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,739
over here if we do control I it'll cut

82
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,620
this portion we can just delete that and

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,959
then this can click up here and control

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,850
I kind of just cuts the clip wherever

85
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,160
we're at I'll double click and delete so

86
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,360
now we have two clips that are about the

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,660
same length we want to make one the left

88
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,250
channel so I'm gonna make our voice out

89
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,329
of the left

90
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,489
we'll make it be the left channel and

91
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,900
make this carrier way be out of the

92
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,120
right channel and then when we play each

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,540
one so well this should be playing out

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,700
of the left ear left speaker or left ear

95
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,519
of your headphones and this should be

96
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,720
playing out of the right ear of your

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,290
headphones down here if we go so perfect

98
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,970
and I'm not sure how so good to route

99
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,320
this carrier wave is actually a lot

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,239
slower than I had intended for it to be

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,930
but we'll see how this sounds all right

102
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,370
so we take it off mute now and then we

103
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,140
need to actually combine these together

104
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,599
so that it's one audio instead of two

105
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,240
separate tracks we want to be one stereo

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,050
track

107
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,879
to do that we go up to well first of all

108
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,800
we have to let them both so we go to

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,039
select and then we go to tracks and we

110
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,770
go in all tracks that selects both of

111
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,539
these and then we go to tracks resample

112
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,520
oh I'm sorry okay no we don't if we go

113
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,909
to tracks mix and then we go to a mix

114
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:50,819
and render and now look it just changes

115
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,560
this so now they are just all they're

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
just one track a left channel and the

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,349
right channel and then if we play it we

118
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,960
still have the what do we do listen the

119
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,520
left and this and the right but it's

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,379
just all together now and now what we do

121
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,310
we select the whole thing by

122
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,780
double-clicking it'll select both

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,340
channels since they're all in one track

124
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,650
and then we just go to effects and

125
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,169
vocoders all the way down here's click

126
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,449
if you're unless maybe you can see it if

127
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,770
you have higher resolution than I do in

128
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,169
this video and then click on vocoder and

129
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,030
then here's where we can change the

130
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,250
settings for this so right now I'll just

131
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,159
hit preview and see how it sounds so

132
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,289
that's not too bad by default I had

133
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:35,430
already played with a little bit if you

134
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,960
go back to defaults this is what it

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,060
might sound like for you see so that's

136
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,810
like really you can hardly hear what's

137
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,639
going on there maybe we'll turn we'll

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,500
keep this up so we just want to play

139
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,699
around and see if we can get something

140
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,580
to change here a little bit that carrier

141
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,889
waves really throwing us off so it

142
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,110
sounds like we're super way down in like

143
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,270
a tunnel I think we want to do something

144
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:16,830
like this more try this so what this is

145
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,330
actually really doing just so you know

146
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,360
so it's taking this wave and it's

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,460
applying it oh it did that I wouldn't

148
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,770
apply the effect but we were we were we

149
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,930
were doing it so let's go back to

150
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,919
vocoder

151
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,680
let's select everything go to vocoder so

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,210
I was just preview I didn't I didn't

153
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,979
apply but if we hit OK it'll actually

154
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,050
what it does it'll actually merge those

155
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,580
together so we start seeing patterns

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,700
here see these patterns of these spikes

157
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,170
we're seeing these patterns happen

158
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,360
everywhere work every time our carrier

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,400
wave had a spike and so it's actually

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,470
creating kind of this effect anyway

161
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,030
that's the way the vocoder works and so

162
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,650
you can play around with it but your

163
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,080
carrier wave adjusting that is gonna

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,270
change a lot how it sounds and that's

165
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,620
what that website and that web tools

166
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,930
does a much better than audacity it just

167
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,420
has much more dynamic input so you can

168
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,400
create the same sound in audacity it

169
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,680
just won't be nearly as quickly because

170
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,990
you can't use those sliders and drag and

171
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,030
drop and do it instantly with live audio

172
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,280
so that other none other tool is a much

173
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,620
much better resource but I just want to

174
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,490
teach you how to do it in audacity

175
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,110
anyway so that you can learn how to do

176
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,100
that appreciate you watching and go

177
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,840
ahead and like links share some if you

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,120
create something using that vocoder tool

179
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,440
I'd love to see like what you share with

180
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
what or what you create so go ahead and

181
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,060
