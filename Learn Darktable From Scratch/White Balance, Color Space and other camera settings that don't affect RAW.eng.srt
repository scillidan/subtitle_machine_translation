1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,200
when I bought my first digital camera

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,359
the first thing I did was Google the

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,820
most optimal settings for it many of the

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,099
good looking people on YouTube

5
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,840
recommended very specific settings such

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,120
as changing the color space or reducing

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,580
contrast and sharpness but no

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,260
explanations to why those settings

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,240
needed to be said

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,400
I think understanding the why will clear

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,260
up some of the misconceptions about

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080
camera native files also known as raw

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,500
files just a side note I'll have to keep

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660
saying raw but remember that I mean

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,840
camera native files after all each

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,059
camera model produces a different file

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,420
and it's not some Global open

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,520
interchangeable format I think raw is

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,739
misleading and confusing

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,780
but hey if that helps to get the point

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,579
across I'll continue saying roll

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,219
button tree aside I can pretty much sum

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,379
up the entirety of this video in one

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,320
sentence color space setting sharpness

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,500
contrast saturation settings and the

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,659
white balance setting has no effect on

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,000
the data that is captured by the sensor

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
while capturing raw files

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,100
now if you don't believe me and I hope

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
you don't stick around for a few minutes

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,479
while I climb down the ladder of image

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,759
making I have already dissected the

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,220
camera native raw file in another video

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,320
where I talked about the cause of ping

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,600
highlights the first part might be

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,060
beneficial to watch as well but a lot of

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,640
it will be repeated here and there

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,320
repetition is the illusion of knowledge

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,140
after all let's start from the beginning

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,000
the camera

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,100
when you turn on the raw mode in your

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
camera you usually have a choice raw

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,360
only raw plus jpeg or jpeg only this is

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,220
the important bit

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,920
even though we select raw only the

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,079
camera will embed a JPEG preview image

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,579
into the file so you can well preview it

48
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,880
otherwise as raw data file is data you

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,460
could not preview it in good phase so

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,200
the camera takes the settings that it

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
would apply to a JPEG and applies those

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,180
settings to the raw preview image that

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,120
preview is a formed image but a raw data

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,640
file is just captured data it is very

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,379
important to disconnect these two things

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,599
as it is where most of the confusion

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,220
stems from

58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,099
so the settings namely white balance

59
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,280
color profile picture settings will be

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,260
applied to the preview of the raw file

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,720
but not its data some of the settings

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,060
you set in camera will be written as a

63
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,220
note for the photo editing software but

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
in no way will it affect the actual

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,000
captured data

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,760
okay let's put that to the test

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,040
first let's take a baseline shot of this

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Polaroid I have set the iso to 6500k

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,060
color space to srgb

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,940
and creative style to standard with the

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,480
default settings

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,379
now let's randomize these settings

73
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,540
I'll completely break the white balance

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,819
setting by going it's custom and doing

75
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,440
whatever it takes to make it look as

76
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,340
weird as possible

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,540
same with the creative style let's

78
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,580
increase the contrast increase the

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,360
saturation and increase the sharpness

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,239
lastly let's swap to Adobe RGB

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,920
now you can see that these two files are

82
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,260
both raw and they differ incredibly

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,599
let's take these files into dark table

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,120
and let's start digging first thing

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,220
you'll notice that these two files still

86
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,739
look incredibly different everywhere in

87
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,140
dark table and that is because dark

88
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,780
table uses the embedded previews that

89
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,819
are embedded in the camera native raw

90
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,200
file

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
why because it's faster

92
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,080
let's keep it that way okay let's load

93
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,140
up the two photos into darkroom

94
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,599
what I will do first is I will get rid

95
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,120
of as many modules as possible these

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,880
modules help us get from data to an

97
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,579
image but we want to be as close to the

98
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,280
data part as possible some modules are

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,320
mandatory so we won't be able to disable

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,020
them we will be looking at nonsense for

101
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,320
a bit but bear with me let's take a

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
snapshot

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
and let's move to the other photo

104
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,320
disable all the modules once

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,580
you can see where this is going

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,520
I can enable the snapshot and we can do

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,780
a one-to-one comparison

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,460
besides the moving curtain

109
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,860
these two photos are identical

110
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,759
even zoom in

111
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,800
on the colorful part

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,220
take another snapshot and compare it to

113
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,120
the other one

114
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,259
see no difference

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,900
even enable the white balance modules

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,820
and make sure they are set to d65

117
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,620
still the same

118
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,259
we can also enable the color calibration

119
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,400
module

120
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,759
just make sure the values are identical

121
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,300
four six three seven

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,900
that's daylight

123
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,320
four six three seven

124
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,600
and that's how you arrive at an

125
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,220
identical result

126
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,020
and there it is

127
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,960
we have two identical photos that were

128
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
captured with completely different

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,440
settings

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,340
and they're both look exactly the same

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,620
just a reminder all these settings will

132
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,860
affect your videos and JPEG files and

133
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
you have to absolutely nail them in

134
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,880
order to preserve as much information as

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,900
possible

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,240
for raw capturing instead of a

137
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,500
conclusion I'll give you a

138
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,880
recommendation

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
adjust these settings to your own taste

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,560
to get previews that closely match your

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,419
raw developing Style

142
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,300
if you like contrast give it a boost if

143
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,280
you like the saturated colors increase

144
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,100
the saturation most importantly feel

145
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,780
free to keep the white balance on your

146
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,300
camera to Auto unless you're one of

147
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,220
those people who carry a gray card in

148
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,759
their wallets
