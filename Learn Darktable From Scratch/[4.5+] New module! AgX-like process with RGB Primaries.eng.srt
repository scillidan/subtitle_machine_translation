1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:05,440
good news doct table has introduced a

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,160
module called RGB primaries now this is

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,080
a big deal to nerds like myself who have

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,559
been waiting for agx like developing in

5
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,880
dark table for quite a long time so RGB

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,160
primaries is a very useful tool that

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,359
allows you to control the individual

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,039
primaries without breaking the overall

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,960
balance of the image it's sort of

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,679
self-explanatory the Hue sliders Slide

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,640
the primary towards the adjacent

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,079
primaries the Purity sliders allow you

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,520
to inser or move the primary towards the

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,719
acromatic point here's an example we

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,879
have a cie chromaticity plot of some

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,120
image and if we reduce the purity of the

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,680
red primary the primary will move

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,760
towards the acromatic point just don't

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,719
forget that this plot is a 2d slice of a

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,559
3D shape and does not paint the whole

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,159
picture of what insetting or reducing

22
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
the Purity actually does to the whole

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,600
range when paired with something like

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
filmic RGB or sigmoid RGB primaries is a

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,200
very powerful tool that will greatly

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
change how I develop my images in dark

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,680
table however this is a tool that can

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,439
very easily break your images so it has

29
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
to be used with care in my opinion RGB

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,119
primaries should only be used to inser

31
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,399
or reduce the purity of the primary if

32
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,000
it's used before sigmoid or filmic RGB

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,880
so before the image is formed now if you

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,560
increase the purity of the primaries

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,719
before the image is formed certain areas

36
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,880
of the image will fail to attenuate

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,640
correctly which will lead to a sort of

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
mangled image let's take this beautiful

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,320
amazing photo of a wall that is

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,399
illuminated by this strong light as you

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,079
can see there's a bit of a yellow Hue

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,080
shift in that bright area we can fix

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,560
that by reducing the

44
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,519
Purity however if we increase the Purity

45
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,760
you'll see that this area will begin to

46
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,319
break this does not increase the overall

47
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,879
oress of this color it only breaks this

48
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,720
area which is illuminated by light so if

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
we push it further this area will fail

50
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,920
to attenuate and simply break and this

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,760
looks absolutely awful and this may very

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
well happen to your Sunset photos for

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
example or uh skin in harsh

54
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,800
light so after we inser that orange what

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,560
can we do to get some of that orange

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,800
back that we've just lost simple

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,080
duplicate the RGB primaries module and

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,200
drag and drop it above our point of

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,480
image formation in this case it's

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,280
sigmoid so now if we expand the rgp

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,519
primaries that's above our formation

62
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,720
point we can increase the purity of that

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,319
orange without breaking this area this

64
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,319
whole process can be demonstrated by

65
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,239
using my favorite color chart we expand

66
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,840
the RG primaries and start pushing the

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,200
sliders towards the right you'll see

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,879
that colors break rather

69
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,400
quickly I don't even have to push it

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,040
that far to completely mangle that blue

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,360
so if I go and tweak these uh

72
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
values the way I like it and then

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
duplicate that

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,400
module and push it above our point of

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,319
image

76
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,519
formation you'll see see that I can

77
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,799
increase the Purity without introducing

78
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,360
too many

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
issues and lastly let's use a more

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
practical example the blue

81
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
bar that everyone is so familiar with if

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
we just enable a couple of modules

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
you'll see that there's a bunch of

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,840
issues in the top right corner it's got

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,199
that uh sort of spilled paint effect

86
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,919
which I strongly dislike let's quickly

87
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,240
jump to RGB primaries module and let's

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,800
insert that blue until we are

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,520
happy um about there and if you think

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,720
this looks a bit purplish you can always

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,199
tweak the

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,320
Hue like that maybe I'll push that back

93
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,440
a

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
bit like so now this looks much better

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,639
already already but as you can see we've

96
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,240
lost a bit of that blue feeling that we

97
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,520
had before again let's duplicate this

98
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,199
module push it above filmic RGB by

99
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,520
holding control shift and just drag and

100
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
dropping now we can increase the purity

101
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,600
of the blue primary until we are

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,440
happy like so of course you can tweak

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
this further but as a quick

104
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,440
demonstration I think this is pretty

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,520
good let's take a quick snapshot of our

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,960
results and let's compare that to the

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,919
original and if you've reached the uh

108
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,039
the limit of the slider you can always

109
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,080
right click and just enter custom value

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,919
like that that's it a short video but I

111
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,240
think we've touched a couple of very

112
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,199
very important concepts of developing a

113
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,800
photo with RGB primaries a big thanks to

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,759
flannel head for making this module um

115
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,080
this is going to be one of the main

116
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,880
Tools in my dark tables toolbox for sure

117
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,599
that's it for today but I'll see you

118
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,039
very very soon with some hopefully

119
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,039
exciting news I'll see you then

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
bye
