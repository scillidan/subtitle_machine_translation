00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,280
hi

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,880
this is going to be a quick video that

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
will eventually drag on for 15 minutes

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,400
on how to batch convert files using dark

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,679
table

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,440
i've been experimenting with developing

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,679
photos in blender and quite a few people

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,240
asked how i get my camera files into

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,439
blender

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
simple i open dark table select the file

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,920
and click export

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
job's done now i have a folder full of

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
exrs that's all there is to it if you

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
spend the time setting all the presets

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,238
up

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,160
two to be precise

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,559
one for the style the other one for the

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
export options

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,520
let's have a look at how to batch

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,320
process or batch convert camera native

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,879
data files also known as raw files

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
to get the most of our captures i'm

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,680
going to try and lose as little data as

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,440
possible while still maintaining a

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
sensible file size

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
open extra as the name suggests is an

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
open source file format developed by

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,920
industrial light and magic yes the same

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,880
people who took part in all these films

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
we all like

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
all of them let's not get too hung up on

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
the file format for now let me just show

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
you how to create presets for batch jobs

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
in dark table and by the way if you

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,960
don't care about making your own presets

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,640
i will include mine in the video

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
description

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
to import a style simply expand apply

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
styles and hit import

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
to import a preset go to settings

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,520
presets and click import

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
before we do anything if this is the

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,159
first time you're running dive table

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
make sure you go to settings

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,399
processing

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
and set the auto apply chromatic

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
adaptation defaults to modern

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
then simply close the window

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
okay let's import some captures

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
simply select your camera files and drag

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
and drop them into the light table

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,479
section

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,840
now select any of them and move to

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,160
darkroom we will create a style that we

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
will be able to reuse later

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
we have some of the modules active

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,879
already but we don't need all of them

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,080
right now

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
in my case for exporting linear rec709

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
exrs i want only the basics with a

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,599
couple of extras

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
the basics include the white balance

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
module which is required for the mosaic

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
module

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
we'll keep orientation

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
i don't really care about exposure at

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
this point

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
for color calibration module i want to

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
bypass it

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
but keep the clip negative rgb from

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
gamut box date

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,400
i don't want to sharpen

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
i don't want filmic rgb

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
and i want to set the output color

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
profile to linear rec 709

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
that's it let's jump back to light table

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
time to save and bake those modules and

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,560
their settings into a style

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
expand the apply styles module and

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
click create

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
now we need to pay attention here a

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
little bit notice how not all of the

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
modules are enabled for example we

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,720
turned off the exposure module and we

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,840
want to include that in our style so we

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
need to include the module that is off

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,239
similarly we disabled filmic rgb that is

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,440
disabled the rest is pretty

89
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,879
self-explanatory include all the modules

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,920
we want to apply to our imported files

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
give it the name

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
i'll call it exr out

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
and click save

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
okay we've got our style done which

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
means that we can apply it to newly

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
imported images

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
like that

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
but we don't want to do this manually

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,959
that's what we have dark table for let's

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,720
jump to export settings

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
yours might be on the right side

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
depending on whose dark table you're on

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
in the export settings we have a line

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
called style

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
and in the drop down we can select our

106
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,599
style that we just created

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
this means that dark table will export a

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
selected image and apply a chosen style

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,238
automatically

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
other settings that we might need to

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
change for exr

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
e x r

113
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
is bit depth

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
and compression

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
let's keep it on

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
biz

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
the target storage has a couple of neat

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
tricks up its sleeve you can sort of

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
program it to do interesting things

120
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
type in the dollar sign and an open

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
bracket

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
to see all the possible operands

123
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
the default one is file folder

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,040
then your export folder i'll call it my

125
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
export

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
exr

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
and

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,080
dollar sign open bracket file name

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
this will create an export exr folder in

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
the original folder where these files

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,199
are located

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
and then create an exr

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
based on its file name

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
and lastly for profile

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
select linear rec709

136
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
i know we set this in the color profile

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,240
in the style

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
but i just want to be sure that we are

139
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
definitely exporting linear rec709 exrs

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
after all these settings are set i'm

141
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
going to save another preset

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
but this time is going to affect the

143
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
export module i'm going to call it

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
export

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
underscore exr

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
okay

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
now just because we can i'm going to

148
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
reset the module

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
and i'm going to make a preset for a

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
simple jpeg export so i can switch

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
between the two at will for the target

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
storage i'm going to call it simply

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
jpeg

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,280
i'm going to change the file format to

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
jpeg

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
90

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
and i want the images to fit into 3000

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
by 3000 size

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
set profile to srgb web save

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
and let's keep the style at none

161
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
i'm going to save this preset as well

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,960
call it export jpeg

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
now we can switch between these two at

164
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,039
will

165
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,919
and we can export either exrs

166
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,280
or jpegs with a squeeze of a mouse

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,520
let's give it a go

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,520
export

169
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
and if we go back to the original folder

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
you will notice that there's a new jpeg

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,160
folder

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
with our crappy undeveloped jpegs

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
okay

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,000
that goes straight to the bin

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that's pretty much for this video

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,599
let me know if you're interested in my

177
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
experiments with photos in blender don't

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
hesitate to drop a comment

179
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
i hope you learned something new today

180
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,919
and i'll see you soon bye
