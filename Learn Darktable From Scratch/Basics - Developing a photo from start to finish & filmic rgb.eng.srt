00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
hello welcome welcome

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,160
this is going to be my first video on

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,760
dark table

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,000
i wanted to make a shortish introduction

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,599
video that i could reference in the

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,639
future

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
so what we are going to do today is

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,439
touch on the very important core basics

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,680
of dark table and we are going to

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,400
process a photo from start to finish

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,680
using scene repaired workflow

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
so you've installed dark table and

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
launched it for the first time

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
of course the first thing we are going

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,800
to do

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
is change some settings

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,879
let's go to preferences

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,079
processing

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
and make sure auto apply pixel workflow

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
defaults are set to scene referred and

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
auto apply chromatic adaptation defaults

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,000
are set to modern

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
that's that we can close this window

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
now this interface might be familiar to

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,680
some of you especially to people coming

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
from adobe lightroom

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
i will try my best to avoid the direct

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,159
comparison in this video

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,799
but as a former lightroom user myself i

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,720
might mislabel a thing or two here and

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
there doc table consists of a couple of

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,759
main sections light table and dark room

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
there are others but they're not going

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,280
to touch these today

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
currently we're in the light table

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
section where we can manage our photos

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,759
and collections the darkroom section is

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,520
purely for developing photos

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
let's start at the beginning

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
let's say i've already copied a couple

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,280
of photos from my sd card in a dedicated

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
folder somewhere on my computer what i

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,240
need to do is import them into dark

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,200
table expand the import section and

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,360
click add to library

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
simply navigate to the folder where you

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,920
copied your photos or click the plus

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,320
sign if it's not in the list of places

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
already

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,200
awesome these are my photos i will tick

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
the ignore jpeg images box as i have no

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,439
use for them

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
i will click the select new button which

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
will only add photos that are not

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
currently in the album

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
this way we can quickly and easily top

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
up any existing album also known as

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
collection with new photos

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,959
you can also preview the photos by

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
clicking on the eye icon

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,959
finally let's hit the add library button

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,959
let's select an image we want to work on

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
and let's go to the dark room

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
we'll quickly gloss over the workflow of

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,360
developing a photo as it's slightly

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,879
different than in other photography

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
software packages just because in dark

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
table you have the complete control of

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,560
developing process and image pipeline

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
on the right you will notice a list of

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,319
familiar terms

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,879
these are called modules there are a few

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,519
mandatory modules most of them you can

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
enable and disable

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
duplicate

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
reset

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
or store a preset off and most

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
importantly move but let's not make a

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,959
mess just yet and leave it in the

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
default order

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
the order is important as the modules

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
are processed from the bottom up it

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
means that it will adjust the raw black

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
white point first then move to white

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
balance then highlight reconstruction so

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
on and so forth since we're using

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
scenery fed workflow let's switch to a

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
predefined scene referred modules and

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,720
module ordering

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
this will get rid of all the deprecated

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
and display referred modules that we

92
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
can't really use in our pipeline

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
at the top here you can currently see

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
six tabs

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
we can modify these in preferences but

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,599
let's work with what we have for now

97
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
the first one is quick settings which

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
i'm not a big fan of so let's go

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
straight to tab 2

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
which contains either active modules or

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
all available modules

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
we can switch between these two modes by

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
using the tab button like a toggle

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
active all

105
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,480
active

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
all

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
the third tab is responsible for the

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
core of the image and it's called base

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
we can tweak the rotation adjust the

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
exposure

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
and most importantly use the filmic rgb

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
to transform our scene into something

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
that can be viewed on a screen

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
next up is color which is

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,680
self-explanatory

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
then image corrections and lastly

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
effects

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,199
i always find myself using the active

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,600
modules tab the most in tandem with the

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
search bar i think it's easier quicker

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,919
and more intuitive

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
but it takes a bit of time to remember

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
all the module names

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,720
luckily they're pretty self-explanatory

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
right let's get to it

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
first things first let's fix the glaring

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
problems

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
see this flat pancake of the sun with a

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
bit of red this yellow drizzled around

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
it now i made this shot the way i made

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
it on purpose

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
it was really hot really sunny spring

133
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,000
day and i really wanted to portray that

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
in the photo so including the entire

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
sign in the picture and overexposing was

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
an excellent decision

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
let's see if we can fix it we'll start

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
by disabling the highlight

139
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
reconstruction module as we will take

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,199
care of the highlights later on

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
firstly i will adjust the exposure

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,320
slightly

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
some parts of the image are still a bit

144
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
dark

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
let's open the module

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
and we can make the adjustments simply

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
by clicking and dragging on the slider

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
hovering over and using a mouse wheel

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
right clicking and making fine

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
adjustments

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
or simply typing a number

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
that looks about right we can now close

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,479
the module next up color calibration

154
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
color calibration deals with the core

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
colors of the image mainly we will use

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
the color calibration to correctly set

157
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
the scene illuminant and adjust the

158
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,680
temperature

159
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
you might notice that there is another

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
module called white balance

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
don't touch that it's currently required

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
for the color calibration module to work

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
correctly

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
right so my eyes say that the image was

165
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,759
shot outside in a nice and sunny day we

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,720
can set the illuminant to d daylight

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
and adjust the temperature to our taste

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,880
that's that

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,680
let's move to my favorite module

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
filmic rgb filmic rgb will help us take

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,720
all the scene information we captured

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
with our camera and compress it into

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
something that our displays can

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
display

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
otherwise everything outside the

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
display's range which is typically zero

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
to one

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
would get clipped out and every flat

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
pancake sun would stay a flat pancake

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
sun

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,759
now this might look scary but i promise

182
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,560
it's only somewhat scary in short this

183
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,479
is showing how our scene will be mapped

184
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,919
to our display

185
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,400
if we turn the axis labels on it will be

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,479
a bit easier to understand

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,160
so the darkest part of the scene we

188
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
captured will be mapped to zero on our

189
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
displays

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
and the brightest part to the maximum

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,479
luminance of our displays

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
the ev0 the middle gray of the scene

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,919
will be mapped to 18

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
of our display's output

195
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
this is because our perception of

196
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
lightness is not linear i wouldn't like

197
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
to get any deeper into this topic in

198
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
this specific video but there are really

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
good in-depth videos by aurelion pierre

200
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,479
the maker of filmic rgb module where he

201
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
goes in depth about how our vision and

202
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,960
the module itself works

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,160
i will link his channel in the

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
description and you might find one or

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
two video cards appearing in my videos

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
in the top right corner so the quickest

207
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
way of getting these settings dialed in

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
right is by entering the values of your

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
light meter that you surely had at the

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,639
time the photo was taken right all right

211
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
the second quickest and good enough

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,680
method

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
is to use the autotune helpers so i'll

214
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
start with a white relative exposure

215
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
okay that looks good to me

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
and then black relative exposure which

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
is slightly off for my taste so i will

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
just increase the dynamic range by

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
adjusting the black relative exposure

220
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
a few stops

221
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
like so

222
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
next we need to get rid of the awful

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
mess that is the sun and a bit of

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
overexposed c here in the corner

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,039
for that let's move to reconstruct tab

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
of filmic the reconstruct tab is aptly

227
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
cold as we have no data what's in the

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
flat pancake as the clipping happened at

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
the sensor so we will try to do our best

230
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
to artistically get out of this sticky

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
situation

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
let's enable the threshold mask by

233
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
clicking on the mask button let's walk

234
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
back the threshold until we see the

235
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,600
clipped parts of the image

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
okay that looks about right

237
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
next up transition

238
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,880
i prefer to adjust this slider until i

239
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
faintly begin to see objects that are

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
not overexposed i find that gives me an

241
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
overall smoother image

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
with only a slight impact on realism

243
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,080
we can now disable the mask

244
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
now for the reconstruction itself

245
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
we can choose how much texture we want

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,680
to attempt to recover

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
i want

248
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,279
none in this photo i don't care about

249
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,399
texture here

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,800
bloom or reconstruct

251
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,160
i like to keep that at zero for a mix of

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
both

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
and lastly whether to fill the clipped

254
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
areas with color or to desaturate them

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
i usually go for almost full

256
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,920
desaturation and as that is the behavior

257
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
of film and in my opinion that is the

258
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,240
best way to convey brightness

259
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
like so

260
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
i think that looks much much better and

261
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
much more natural

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,920
no more hard edge around the sun no more

263
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
ugly cyan and no more rat piss yellow

264
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,320
time coined by troy sobotka and frankly

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
i can't stop using it

266
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
right all we have to do now is

267
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
straighten the horizon and bring back

268
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
some of the color into the image we can

269
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
do that very quickly just type in

270
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
rotation in the search bar expand the

271
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,360
rotate and perspective module and simply

272
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
right click and drag on something that

273
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
should be perfectly straight

274
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,320
click the horizon

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
done and done

276
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
next up color

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
for color always use color

278
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
balance

279
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
rgb

280
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,760
it's also made by aurelie and pierre so

281
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
we are absolutely sure it plays nice

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
with filmic rgb

283
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
again i will not get into detail in this

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,519
video i'm just going to increase the

285
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
global vibrance which will increase the

286
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,160
colorfulness of the subdued colors

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
okay i'm pretty happy with 43

288
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,079
oh and a pro tip

289
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,680
always check your photo against the

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
white background from time to time you

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
can always do that by clicking on the

292
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
little light bulb icon at the bottom

293
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
it looks like the photo is a bit too

294
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
warm for my taste

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
so i can always go back to color

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
calibration

297
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,640
and reduce the temperature a tiny bit

298
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
like so

299
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
yeah i'm pretty happy with the results i

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
think we managed to salvage the clipped

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,560
areas and portray the brightness and the

302
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
overall niceness of the weather of that

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,760
day

304
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
awesome let's check that the output

305
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,800
color profile is set to srgb and let's

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
move back to light table

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
in here i would like to introduce you to

308
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
another feature

309
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
styles also known as presets

310
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
select an image you've already developed

311
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
and click create name your style

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
i'll call it trip 1

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
sunny

314
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
and enable all the modules and their

315
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
settings you want transfer to other

316
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
photos

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,600
modules like highlight reconstruction

318
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
which i have disabled

319
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
exposure filmic rgb and color balance

320
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
rgb and hit save now let's develop

321
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
another photo that i took on the same

322
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,560
day pretty much at the same spot but

323
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
this time let's use the style that i've

324
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
just created to give us a nice baseline

325
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
i'll move back to darkroom

326
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,839
i'll click on the styles icon and choose

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,160
the style i've just created

328
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,560
that looks great already i would just

329
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,279
adjust the exposure a tiny bit

330
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,800
and disable the reconstruction that

331
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
we've done to the other photo

332
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,200
simply by increasing the threshold

333
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
up to about four

334
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
you can always double click on the

335
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
slider to reset it to the default value

336
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
like so

337
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
perfect

338
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
back to light table we go

339
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,079
grab the two images we've just developed

340
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,680
and let's expand export section

341
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
select the output folder

342
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
select the format

343
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
and resize if necessary i want the image

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
to fit into 3000 by 3000 pixels

345
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
and hit export

346
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
it will take a second or two

347
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
and your images are going to be ready if

348
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
you're running windows 11 you can

349
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,199
preview the files for the latest photos

350
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,720
app it works well and it's color managed

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,079
finally

352
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
keep in mind that dark table will create

353
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
these sidecar xmp files

354
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
i recommend keeping them together with

355
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
your camera native raw files

356
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,800
as they store all the settings and

357
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
tweaks we've done to the photo when we

358
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
developed it

359
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
that's that we developed a few photos

360
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
using dark table

361
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,720
in this touristy tour bus manner

362
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,639
i'd like to say a personal thank you to

363
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
aurelien pierre and his work on both

364
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,000
dark table and youtube tutorials big

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
thank you to troy sobotka as well and

366
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,199
his work educating their color curies i

367
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,480
will link his scriptures in the

368
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
description as well i hope i wasn't too

369
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,240
boring and hope you learned something

370
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,920
new today see you soon bye
