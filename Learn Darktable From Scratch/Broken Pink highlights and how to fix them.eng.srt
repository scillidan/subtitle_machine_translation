1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,040
so you've heard pretty cool things about

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,279
dark table and you've decided to try it

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,120
out you load your first capture and wait

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,080
what the sky is pink the c is pink dark

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,639
table is rubbish the sun is clearly

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
yellow as displayed in this 2d graph

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,960
so why is dark table turning the sun

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,680
pink and what can we do to fix it the

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
most common culprit of pink areas in

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,039
your capture is

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
highlight clipping at the sensor

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
this is what happens when you have too

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
much fun in the sun

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
part of the data you captured hit the

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
ceiling of the sensor's upper limit and

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
the sensor said yep i'm full write

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
maximum values in all these areas

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079
when we load a camera native data file

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,800
also known as raw into dark table

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,199
we apply certain processes

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,920
so we can visualize the data captured

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
i'm going to try and investigate why the

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,399
highlights turn pink so bear with me or

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
skip to the chapter in the video where i

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,160
attempt to fix the pink highlights

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
let's say that this is our capture with

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,320
a bit of overexposure i will disable all

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,479
modules that i can disable

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
so we can see what's happening step by

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,159
step

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
i'm also going to skip the mosaic as

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
this throws us off a little bit

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,799
and

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
i'm going to set the raw black and white

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,119
point to pass through

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
now we can work this process from the

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
bottom up

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
at this point we're pretty much

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
visualizing the data values in our raw

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
file

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,799
if we zoom in to a stupid percentage we

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
can see the photosite pattern

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,759
each photosite contains a single numeric

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,200
value

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
right now if we look at the raw black

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
white point module we can see that the

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
largest photosite value

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,759
three 65535 gets a white square and the

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
lowest value zero

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
gets a black square

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,240
our squares at this point are a certain

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
shade of gray because we are not using

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
the whole range between zero and six

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
five five 65535

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800
the camera that i shot with can only

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
write 14 bit data files

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,160
which means the maximum value is

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
16 383

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
if i drag the slider back to the

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,599
manufacturer recommended value of 16 300

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
you will notice that we are simply

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,000
marking where our useful data ends and

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
where it begins

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
if i reset this module the values will

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,480
change depending on the camera they came

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
from

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
now we're going to take a step that is

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,319
going to be a bit confusing

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
because we know the bare filter pattern

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
of our sensor we can give these values

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
an arbitrary color i would give them

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
different colors other than green red

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
and blue but i don't have a choice at

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
this point so here it is

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
remember

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,080
we cannot deduce color information from

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
a single value this is just a

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,000
visualization a colorful chart if you

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
will you will notice that every second

80
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,480
square is green this is the bayer

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
pattern of the sensor it is called the

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
cfa color filtration array the most

83
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,000
common one is red green green blue why

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
there are more green squares than red

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
and blue bryce bear's patented pattern

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
included an additional green filter per

87
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
every red green and blue filter to mimic

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
the physiology of the human eye which

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
uses m and l cones to perceive luminance

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
they are most sensitive to green light

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
so how do we get something useful out of

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
these squares well first we need to

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
debayer

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,840
which is synonymous to the mosaic we

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
have quite a few algorithms to choose

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,480
from

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,360
that in a nutshell take information from

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
adjacent squares and approximate a value

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
so instead of one value per square we

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,159
want to have three values per square

101
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
three is the magic number here as

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
coincidentally we will end up with three

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
channels that make an image red green

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,560
and blue

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
also known as rgb

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
but right now we're still in large

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
number land

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
now let's do mosaic we will use a

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
debayering algorithm but will not

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
account for the fact that we have more

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
green squares than red and blue squares

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
we just want to get three values per

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
square instead of one value each i'll

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
select rcd for the mosaic king because

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
it's the default

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
and here it is it's as if we averaged

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
all the squares in a fancy way to get a

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
smooth visualization of the data in the

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
raw file the only thing that is missing

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
now is to take into account that we have

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
more green squares than red and blue

122
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
squares we need to scale the three

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
values accordingly

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
i'm going to do this manually for

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
maximum effects and that's aha moment

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
but it's best to keep this module at d65

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
notice how everything appears to be

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
green

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
except for the sun and the clouds

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
they look white

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
keep that in mind

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
now watch what happens when i move the

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
tint slider and make the preview less

134
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
green and more pink

135
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
as i move the tint slider towards pink

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
the visually green areas move towards

137
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,240
white

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
the visually white areas move towards

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
pink

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
since this operation is still simply

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
mathematical and is not performed in the

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
color space or constraint by a display

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
we are able to get values above 1 or 255

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
because we perform these operations

145
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,919
non-destructively

146
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,479
later on in the pipeline we take these

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,280
values and usher them into a gamut

148
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,000
finally giving them try stimulus meaning

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
in simpler terms we are finally in rgb

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
land and our values begin to hold

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
meaning

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,639
technically it happened a bit earlier

153
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
since i'm not able to turn the module

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,120
off you can imagine that up to the input

155
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
color profile module everything is black

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,000
and white values that we haven't applied

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
any meaning to

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
nice we manually produced the ping

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
highlights and now we know that it's not

160
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,319
a result of something being broken but a

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
result of being non-destructive

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,479
that's it

163
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
let me reset the unfortunately called

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,759
white balance module in its default and

165
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
let me enable the color calibration

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
module as well

167
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
right it's time to do something about

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,240
that pink sky

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,039
let's first assume our default filmic

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
rgb workflow

171
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
i will move to reconstruction tab as i

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
will need to reconstruct the areas that

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
were clipped at the sensor

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
i will enable the mask preview

175
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,599
as it is important to select the area

176
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
we're working on

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,599
right now it's black

178
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,639
because nothing is selected

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,400
i'll walk the threshold slider back

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
until i see the over exposed areas turn

181
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,360
white

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,680
i will adjust the transition so i can

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
almost see the rest of the objects in

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
the picture

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
now for the reconstruction bit

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
i've already went over these sliders and

187
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
what they do in other two videos that i

188
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
will link in the description

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
right now i will gloss over their

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
function

191
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
as i search for the best result

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
we can turn the mask off

193
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
for the first slider let's keep the

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
reconstruction technique in the middle

195
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
between structure and texture the second

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,479
slider

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,800
i will attempt to reconstruct instead of

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
bloom first because i feel there is

199
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
enough detail for some reconstruction

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,520
there in the highlights and as always i

201
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
will go full gray on the last slider

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
our color information is mangled due to

203
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
clipping and i'm not going to bother

204
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
preserving something i don't care about

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
full grain

206
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,000
okay we still have the pink sky and pink

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,879
c

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
that means that our threshold is too

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,639
high

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
i will walk that back slightly

211
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
until it's completely gone

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
okay it looks better but i can feel it

213
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,919
looks a bit harsh still let's try to

214
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
favor more bloom instead of

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,599
reconstructing

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
there we go

217
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,360
nice and smooth we can even increase the

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
white relative exposure a little bit

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
which will likely bring back a bit of

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,560
pink highlights

221
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
but we can fix that once again by

222
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
adjusting the threshold

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,279
there we go

224
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
problem fixed

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
often there are times where we don't

226
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
want to use filmic rgb for example

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
exporting exhaust to use with other

228
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
software

229
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
if we turn off filmic color balance rgb

230
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
color calibration

231
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
we end up with ping highlights again

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
but worry not because we have a

233
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
highlight

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,040
the construction module

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
let's turn that on

236
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
and i will clear the search term

237
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
now we have the most basic of methods

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
enabled which is called clip highlights

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
after we have scaled our photoside

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,519
values and if any value exceeded our

241
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
threshold it will be clipped simple as

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
that this will result in a flat pancake

243
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
with hue shifts everywhere

244
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
it also pretty much matches the areas

245
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
that were clipped at the center we can

246
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
preview that with this little sensor

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,600
clipping preview button

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
if we reduce the exposure later on in

249
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,720
the pipeline

250
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
we will see that it has no effect on the

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
clipped area

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
it just gets darker

253
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
the next a more intelligent option is to

254
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
reconstruct an lch

255
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
it will attempt to recover some

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
information from the remaining unclipped

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
channels it is a much better option in

258
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
my opinion even though the reconstructed

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,000
highlight contains no color information

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
we can recover data that we can work

261
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
with if i reduce the exposure now

262
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
you will see that we managed to recover

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
some detail i prefer this setting for my

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,360
exr exports when i need them

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
the penultimate one is reconstruct color

266
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
which gives a similar result to

267
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
reconstruct in lch

268
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
but gains the values based on

269
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
surrounding areas you get some notion of

270
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
color back but the results aren't always

271
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,079
stable

272
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
and the last one is guided laplacians it

273
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
is the most resource intensive

274
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
but in theory it should produce the best

275
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,640
results however it should be reserved to

276
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
cases where you don't have large areas

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
that were clipped at the sensor

278
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,240
otherwise it's not very effective

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
okay that's all the material i've

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,079
prepared for you today i hope you found

281
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,920
this useful and hopefully you've learned

282
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,720
something new today so see you soon

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
bye

284
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
you
