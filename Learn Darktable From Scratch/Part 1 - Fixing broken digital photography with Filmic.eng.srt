1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
hey welcome back

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,319
it's been a while i know

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,240
before we start i want to present you

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
with a little experiment

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
let's split this canvas in two

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
i'll paint one side with

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
80 blue

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
and i'll paint the other side

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000
with 80 blue and 1 green

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
and we can merge these two

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,880
and i'll delete the bottom two layers

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
okay hide the line

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
now these two colors

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
are almost indistinguishable to the

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
naked eye i'll apply an exposure filter

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
and what do you think is going to happen

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
when i push this slider all the way to

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,399
the right

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
this is going to be a the image will

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
become very blue and stop changing b the

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
image will become white and stop

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,160
changing

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,239
or c the image will turn to

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,040
correct

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
the image turned to

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
it makes no sense whatsoever for these

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
two formerly indistinguishable colors to

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,479
become so different after we increase

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,240
the exposure

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
i can 100 guarantee that you've already

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
seen this kind of scion in digital

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
photography

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
especially in your usual day-to-day

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
smartphone photos

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
the gradient of the sky goes from nice

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
dark blue to lighter blue then breaks

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
into cyan and eventually turns white

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
this is called a hue shift and it's

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,600
prominent everywhere the sky the sun

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
even yourself is in room lighting you

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
can even notice it in some 3d animation

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,960
renders

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
here's an exaggerated example with a 3d

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,719
render

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
watch the background sky blue turn into

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
cyan and the orangey brown scare turn

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,959
into yellow hue shifts are all over the

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
place so what would be the expected

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
result the image should turn to white as

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,160
i increase the exposure just like it

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
does for example in dark table using the

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,280
filmic rgb module

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
it makes sense that the minute

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
differences between the two colors is

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,239
kept

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
and it only makes sense that substantial

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
overexposure leads to completely wide

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
image the people who engineered film

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
photography knew it even the painters of

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,560
renaissance knew it but somehow digital

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,879
color came and we forgot

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
thankfully this bad image formation has

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
awoken a bunch of smart angry people who

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
had enough knowledge and skill to try

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
and fix that awful imagery we're

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
bombarded with daily now it's up to us

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
to use the tools and recognize

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
and point out the terrible things that

69
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
are done to imagery

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
remember the ugly 3d render

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
well now let's watch the filmic render

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
side by side with our earlier render

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
same scene but the outcome looks much

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
nicer and much more natural almost like

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
a painting almost film-like even popular

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
software like adobe lightroom does this

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,480
to an extent

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
of course i have no control over it but

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
it's there somewhere

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
hold on you might say irish to you just

81
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,640
talking about display referred and scene

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,599
referred workflows yes and no

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
but i don't want to get into that in

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
this video as this will need a video

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
rant of its own

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
the terminology is really fuzzy right

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
now while it settles it's best that we

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
focus on the image and the result it's

89
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
the image that is of utmost importance

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
to us and the viewer

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,599
just keep in mind that photography is

92
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
art and don't limit yourself by trying

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
to replicate the real world in your

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
photos it's not possible and probably

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
never will be

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
great images that are excellent

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
beautiful interesting as an object on

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
its own

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
not some sort of 2d bargain bin

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
representation of the real world

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
you know what's not an image data

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
data you capture with your digital

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
camera that data is not an image until

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,960
we develop it and turn it into an image

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
until we touch it it's just a bunch of

106
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
sensor readouts

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
people call them raw images but i'm not

108
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
the fan of that name either

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
camera native data capture file is a

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
mouthful but it represents that raw

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
files are different from camera to

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
camera

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
and most importantly it recognizes that

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
the data capture is not an image

115
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
i'm just going to call it scene this

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
just kidding we'll figure something out

117
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
as we go

118
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,720
so how do we turn not an image into an

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,919
image

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
we use tools good modern tools that help

121
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,440
us form the image in the way that it's

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,639
intuitive and most importantly makes

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,440
sense dark tables filmic rgb is one of

124
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
those tools

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
the filmic rgb module in dark table was

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
created by aurelion pierre who was

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
inspired by troy stobotka the person who

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
made filmic for blender the idea of the

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
whole filmic thing is that it mimics

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,000
film in both highlight and shadow

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
desaturation as well as beautiful

132
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
highlight and shadow roll-offs

133
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
avoiding hue shifts as much as possible

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
basically it is a view transform it

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
takes the data captured by a camera and

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
forms an image that your monitor is able

137
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
to display with the help of a few

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
modules

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
and your input

140
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
that way we avoid the issue that was

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
shown at the beginning of the video we

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
can avoid hue shifts both sterilization

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,080
and other unpredicted distortions that

144
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
ruin our picture

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
let's have a better look at what is

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
going on

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
i have dark table opened where i have a

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
bunch of test images that help us limit

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,600
test and better visualize the changes to

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
our photos

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
you can already see that we're

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
encountering the same issue we've

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,400
encountered at the beginning of the

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
video

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
the ugly broken blue

156
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
has turned into cyan and is ruining our

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
landscape

158
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
let's fix that by simply enabling the

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
filmic rgb module

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
notice how the blue

161
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
just transitions to white

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
without any hue shift whatsoever there's

163
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
no scion there's no posterization

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
there's no

165
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
clipped highlights below the sun

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
everything's nice and smooth

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,600
similarly the same issue can be seen in

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
sunsets

169
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,479
the red orange sunset can turn into ugly

170
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
yellow really quickly

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
this is also a hue shift and it's

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,440
something filmic can fix

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
there we go much better

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,240
we can compare these two side by side

175
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,360
look at the difference

176
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
this looks harsh

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
overcooked and almost deep fried

178
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,440
whereas this feels natural and smooth

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
first of all let's get familiar with

180
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
filmic rgb

181
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
there are a few buttons that will help

182
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
us better understand how it all works

183
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,360
the a button turns the axis labels on

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
that helps us immensely

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,599
and the rotate button switches between

186
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
different modes of graphs that show us

187
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,720
what filmic rgb is doing

188
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
let's settle on the first one that's

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
called look only that's what we care

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
about the most right now

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
the orange dot somewhere in the middle

192
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,400
indicates the middle gray point notice

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,199
that the middle gray of your capture

194
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,479
is mapped to

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,599
18

196
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
of the display's luminance

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,520
why not 50

198
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
you might ask

199
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
because humans perceive lightness in a

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
non-linear way this is where we mix some

201
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
biology into physics

202
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
we humans are quite a bit more sensitive

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
to changes in dark tones compared to the

204
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,000
same incremental changes in bright tones

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
here's a very awful example

206
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,639
at home your room is illuminated by what

207
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
one or two lights but at the office you

208
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,240
have a raisin array of lights when they

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
don't feel that much brighter than the

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
feeling in the room while the change

211
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,039
between one two and three lights feel

212
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,958
massive a change between 20 21 or 22

213
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
lights feel minuscule even though we're

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
adding the same amount of light

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,720
the 18 of luminance of the leads in your

216
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
display become an on-screen color picker

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
value of 0.5

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
in perfect conditions of course the

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
middle gray point is set and adjusted

220
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
when you adjust the exposure in the

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
exposure module

222
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
if you have a lot of dark tones in your

223
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
image

224
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
that you want to be visible the balance

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
might look off

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
but it's perfectly normal as the grade

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
point of zero ev of the capture is

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
always pinned to the eighteen percent of

229
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
luminance of the display

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,720
the middle gray or neutral gray has that

231
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
name for a reason

232
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
in ideal conditions it stays neutral

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
it does not obtain chroma or saturation

234
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
and it does not get brighter dimmer when

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
you adjust the contrast

236
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
until a certain point in your image

237
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,279
making pipeline of course

238
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
what else can we see in this graph

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
well the main subject is this white

240
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
s-curve

241
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
values from the camera file are mapped

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
to the display according to the curve

243
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
lowest brightness values in the capture

244
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
will get pinned to the lowest luminance

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
of your display

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
the highest values of your captcha will

247
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
be mapped to maximum luminance of your

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,800
display

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
it's in your control where you set these

250
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
points using black and white relative

251
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,760
exposure

252
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,640
see these numbers change

253
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
these s bands

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
provide smooth transitions between

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
shadows and mid-tones

256
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,959
then mid-tones and highlights that way

257
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
we avoid clipping in post and the

258
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
dreaded u shifts

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
lastly there's this gray line which

260
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
indicates saturation

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
this is also mimicking how film behaves

262
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,680
the more you expose the film

263
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,640
the brighter and less saturated it gets

264
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
same in the dark areas

265
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
the darker it gets the less saturated it

266
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
becomes

267
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
this alone is an incredible feature of

268
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
the tool as it saves all those pretty

269
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,360
sunsets of ours

270
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
not only sunsets but the bright objects

271
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,279
that usually get the gaudy digital look

272
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
as it fails to lose saturation with

273
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
intensity

274
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
this curve will not be present in later

275
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
darkroom iterations

276
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
but i think it's important and it's good

277
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
to know what it does and how it

278
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
interacts with the image

279
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
desaturation feels very natural as it's

280
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
the best way to convey brightness in my

281
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
opinion if you look at this extreme

282
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,279
example you will notice that the light

283
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,160
sword illuminates the character

284
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,880
but the character looks completely flat

285
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
especially in this area

286
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
now if we desaturate that area using

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
filmic rgb

288
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
we will actually get some information

289
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
back that we can understand

290
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
it's still perfectly clear that the

291
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
light sword is red and it emits red

292
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,320
light that is very strong even if some

293
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,120
parts of this figurine are less red and

294
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
more white

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
and this exactly is the secret sauce of

296
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,079
filmic and filmic rgb the red sword is

297
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,959
an excellent extreme example but these

298
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,240
things happen to us every day everywhere

299
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
sunsets skies lamps christmas lights

300
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
incoming light through a window from

301
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
outside

302
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
fire foreheads reflections the list

303
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,639
never ends

304
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
it's time for this grotesque mockery of

305
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
photography to end let's move forward

306
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
somewhere where everything doesn't look

307
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,880
like a deep-fried nuclear apocalypse

308
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
that's a lot of information to process

309
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
for one time we'll finish examining the

310
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
filmic rgb module in part two of the

311
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,560
series where i shake my fist at the sky

312
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
some more don't forget to check out the

313
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
more information on this topic

315
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
thanks for watching i hope you learned

316
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,399
something new today

317
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,519
see you soon

318
