1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,360
hey

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,120
welcome to part two of getting to know

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,560
filmic

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
i hope you've watched the part 1 of this

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,840
series where we pondered about

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,160
photography and the whole concept of

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
filmic what it's for and what it does

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
otherwise this might feel like a baptism

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,279
by fire

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,359
let's not waste any time and let's jump

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
right in so today i'm going to be mainly

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
working on this inside and outside

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,599
capture

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,880
next time

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,439
this ultimate test of my abilities in

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
using filmic rgb module

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
two photos that would normally be

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
discarded if it wasn't for awesome tools

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,600
we have today

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
we've dealt with a blown out sky in

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
another video you can find it in the

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,879
cards at the top right corner or in the

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
video description

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,719
hence today we'll be looking at a few

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
different examples

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
we'll start with the easier one

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
first let's move to darkroom and let's

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
evaluate the level of brokenness

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
let's check what's clipped at the sensor

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
and how much painting we'll have to do

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,320
and how much salvaging we should attempt

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,439
looks pretty bad

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
but nothing we can't fake fix

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
okay let's start with a quick

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
perspective adjustment

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
type in perspective turn that on

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
and click on all the automatic buttons

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,159
this one scans the image for straight

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,360
lines

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
and that one corrects it vertically

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
i'll close that and that looks much

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
nicer we're no longer feeling like ants

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
next up i'll adjust the temperature a

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
little bit

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
as i can feel the photo is slightly

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
bluish

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
especially at the bottom here

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
i'll just increase this

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
until we're happy

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
okay that looks about right

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
let's use the color assessment mode

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,878
okay i'm pretty happy with that it's a

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
bit on the warmer side but it was a

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
really warm day

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
so i might want to convey that with my

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
image

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
next up i'll adjust the exposure

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,120
just a tiny bit

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
i feel like the image is a bit too

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,319
bright

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,280
knowing that this is a shadow area

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
away from the sun

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
i might want to make it

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,440
a little bit darker

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
remember that by setting the exposure

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
we're also picking where our neutral

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,519
gray is going to be

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,720
now we can open filmic

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
something that will actually fix some of

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
the issues with the photo

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
i'm going to be using filmic v6 which is

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
going to reach the mainstream dark table

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
pretty soon

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,879
just so the video doesn't become

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,200
obsolete a weekend

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
i will set the preserved chrominance to

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
know for this video this might ruin our

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
rgb ratios

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
but it's usually less noticeable than

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
the artifacts that the other

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
preservation methods create that's my

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
experience at least right onto filmic

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
i'm going to use that auto-tune levels

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,239
which did a pretty good job

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,480
i would like to adjust the contrast just

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
a little bit

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
notice how this straight line rotates

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
around this orange dot which is our

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
neutral gray point

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
that we sort of set in the exposure

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,799
module i'll move the slider to the right

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
and watch the straight line rotate

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
okay that's a bit too much i'll dial it

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
back a bit

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
that looks about right

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
reduce the latitude a bit

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,519
so we get some nicer transitions

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
okay i'm pretty happy with that

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
now we can switch to reconstruct tab

100
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
first we need to select the areas

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,159
that we want to reconstruct we can do

102
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,599
that by enabling the mask preview

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
right now nothing is selected so the

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,839
reconstruct tab is basically disabled

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
i will start walking back the threshold

106
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
slider

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
until we get white where there was

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
significant overexposure

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
okay

110
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
i think it's

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
right about here then using the

112
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
transition slider i can sort of feather

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
my selection usually adjusting the

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
transition until i can vaguely see the

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
rest of the image works best from my

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
experience

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
like that

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
okay we can disable the mask

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
that got rid of

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
a little bit of pink we had before which

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
means we're doing something right

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
now we have these three sliders that

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
will help me hide my mistake of

124
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
overexposure

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,759
i'll zoom in just a little bit so we can

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,720
see better

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
the first slider is structure versus

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,280
texture

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
structure and texture are reconstruction

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
strategies if we move this slider over

131
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
to the structure side

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
we're basically saying we don't care

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
what's in the middle of the patch we are

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
reconstructing

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
we just want a smooth in painting a

136
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
smooth gradient

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
that works great with things like

138
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,240
overblown skies

139
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,320
whereas the texture strategy attempts to

140
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
recover and creates detail

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
this might be useful for things like

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
skin or textured surfaces

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
i'll be honest i've never had a case

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
where going full texture was better than

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,039
structure

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
understand the texture mode attempts to

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
recover detail from unclipped channels

148
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
but that has never yielded me any

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
results that i was satisfied with

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
therefore i either keep this at 0

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
or lean a little bit to the left

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
i think zero is fine in this case

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
now for bloom versus reconstruct

154
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
i've noticed that blooming works very

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,639
well when it comes to skies and the sun

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,240
for example

157
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
however with objects that are

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
illuminated by a bright light

159
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
i find that keeping to the right yells

160
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
better results

161
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
i'm going to keep that at 100

162
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
reconstruct

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
lastly

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
gray or colorful details this one is

165
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
easy

166
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
i almost always keep the left of the

167
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
slider

168
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
a portion of the capture we are trying

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
to reconstruct almost never holds any

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
meaningful color

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
as at least one channel was clipped at

172
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
the sensor at the time of the capture

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
that means that the color information is

174
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560
gone and there is no point in trying to

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
recover it i'll go 100 gray this time as

176
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,840
well

177
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
done the pink is gone

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,160
we have this

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
flatish white area

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
but i think we can fix that

181
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
first i'll enable the color balance rgb

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
i'll do the quickdom thing again and

183
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
just boost the global vibrance

184
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,639
let's not get into the depths of color

185
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
balance rgb module just yet

186
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
okay looks much more vibrant

187
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,720
right now we have this lovely warm sunny

188
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
view

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
but the incoming light is very white it

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
is slightly uncanny and ruins the

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
imagine

192
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,360
what we can do as artists

193
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
we can do some close domain

194
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
modifications

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,960
in short i'm taking out the brush the

196
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,360
scarf and the beret and i'm going to

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
paint something on my photo

198
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
i'm going to duplicate the color balance

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,360
rgb module

200
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
and i'm going to create a new instance

201
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,520
i'll reset it just in case

202
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
and i'm going to ctrl and shift and

203
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
click it and drag it above filmic rgb

204
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
this means that we're not influencing

205
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
filmic rgb module with this artistic

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
adjustment and we're working with closed

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
domain data also known as display

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
repaired

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,360
first of all let's do a quick parametric

210
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
mask

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
i'll enable the mask preview and i will

212
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,958
invert the mask

213
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,000
grab the slider and walk it back

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
until we've selected the over exposed

215
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
areas

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
i'll do a bit of feathering

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,160
a bit of blurring

218
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,519
maybe a tiny bit more

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
this back a little bit

220
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
yeah i think that is okay

221
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,399
that will do the job

222
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,120
i can disable the mask preview

223
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
and i'm going to go straight to the four

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
ways and

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
i'm going to change the hue

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
of the highlights gain

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
i'm going to change it to something

228
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
warm

229
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
ish

230
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,600
now what i need to do is increase the

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
chroma

232
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,720
just a tiny tiny little bit

233
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
let's not overdo it and turn it into

234
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
sepia

235
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
just a little bit so it feels

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
warmer

237
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,640
okay

238
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
again enable color assessment mode to

239
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,839
help us judge

240
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,800
okay that's a bit too orangey

241
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
okay i'm pretty happy with that i think

242
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
that did it

243
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
i think we managed to salvage it

244
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,720
from an image that was about to be

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
discarded to something that we can

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
actually use

247
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
i'm happy with the result

248
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
even though we only mainly touched a few

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
modules

250
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
so color balance rgb filmic rgb

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
exposure

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
color calibration

253
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,920
oh and perspective

254
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
and that's about it

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
in reality i would keep working on this

256
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
image until i'm fully happy but for the

257
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
purposes of this video i think it's more

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
than acceptable

259
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
next time

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
we'll be looking at an even more complex

261
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
problem

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
saturated colors in broken highlights

263
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
but that's going to be it for the part 2

264
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
of the deep dive into filmic rgb

265
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
hope you learned something new today

266
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,519
i'll see you soon

267
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,519
bye

268
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,160
you
