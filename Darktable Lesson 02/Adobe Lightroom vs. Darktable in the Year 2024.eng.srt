1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,540
I think the time has come for me to

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,700
address the lightroom-shaped elephant in

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,839
the room

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,720
after a recent review of dark table by a

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,120
very popular photography website I've

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,340
decided I'll give my two cents about the

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,079
whole Lightroom versus dark room

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,840
comparison I've been using Lightroom

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,420
since its Inception and have been a

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,539
Lightroom user until late 2020s

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,220
with all the different versions of

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,320
Lightroom I will focus on Lightroom

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,699
classic for desktop

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,500
I'd like to begin with a conclusion dark

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,200
table is an application that gives you

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
more control of your image formation and

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,899
image formation pipeline dark table is

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,640
better if you like spending time

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
crafting each image and require finer

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,480
control

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,300
dark table also includes better capture

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,760
repair tools especially for highlight

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,079
recovery

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,420
Lightroom on the other hand provides

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,120
quick consistent results that are

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,239
satisfactory the entry barrier is very

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,280
low as it requires virtually no

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,380
knowledge on technical details of color

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,920
image formation and image pipeline all

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,900
the technical work is done by Adobe

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Engineers behind the scenes since I'm a

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,119
big fan of bad analogies here's one

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,720
doctable is a rally car it will produce

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,479
results that are unparalleled given the

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,700
right driver the driver needs to be

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,360
experienced knowledgeable and patient if

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,040
everything goes well the driver will

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,259
enjoy the drive and will be satisfied

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,939
with the result

40
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,939
however the rally car is awful if all

41
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,860
you need to do is drive to work pick up

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,540
your kids from school and get some

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,040
groceries

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,920
and this is where a Lightroom comes in

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
Lightroom is a minivan practical easy to

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,000
drive

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,460
it can get 7 people from point A to

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,040
point B with ease and comfort you don't

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,020
need special knowledge of the limits of

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,939
your engine nor do you need an ear

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,060
protection or a helmet it looks nice it

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,219
drives smooth and it gets the job done

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,179
day in Day Out so which is better a

54
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,220
rally car or a minivan

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,560
is a rally car a good replacement for a

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,020
minivan which one gives you more driving

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,440
pleasure and this exactly is the point

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,959
it even is highlighted in dark table's

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,500
GitHub dark table is not a free Adobe

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,959
Lightroom replacement it is a digital

61
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,360
image developing software and it can

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,459
produce a result that is identical to

63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,440
what Lightroom can produce

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,140
also includes a form of digital image

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,599
management but that is about where the

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,360
similarities with Lightroom end I see

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,360
dark table more of a laboratory where

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
you're free to experiment and really

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,379
develop your photos

70
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,959
I see Lightroom as a more of a photo

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,239
retouching software where you start with

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,700
a good Baseline provided by Adobe

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,040
engineers and then you make adjustments

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,260
according to your taste or preference

75
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,560
if I was forced to point out the most

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,780
impactful difference between the two

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,120
software I'd probably say it's dark

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
tables filmic RGB I suppose many people

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
would like me to say that dark table is

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
scene referred and litum is display

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,819
referred but I'm not going to say that

82
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,099
filmic RGB and its highlight

83
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,500
reconstruction tool are incredibly

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,080
strong and provide incredible control

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,379
that being said Lightroom does something

86
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,900
similar to filming however it's all

87
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,060
buried somewhere deep and it's not at

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,099
all exposed to the user

89
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm pretty sure it's hitting under

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,260
profiles but it could be somewhere under

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,860
calibration the second is powerful tool

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,920
as the first one is their ability to

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,280
reorder the modules the ability to turn

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,840
them off and on the ability to duplicate

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,239
and masked each one of them

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,120
this gives incredible control of image

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,940
processing pipeline control the

98
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,819
Lightroom simply does not give you

99
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,000
lastly without going too much in depth I

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
have to mention that dark table is open

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,100
source software that is free of adobe's

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,560
whims and ever-changing licenses

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,259
Remember You Don't Own Lightroom you

104
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,780
just lease it it's Adobe software that's

105
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,900
on loan to you all those collections you

106
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,900
made are proprietary to Adobe software

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
you're fully locked in if you break the

108
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,360
Euler and Adobe terminates your license

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
all you end up having is a brick catalog

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,280
file that can only be opened with

111
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,300
Lightroom

112
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,900
sure you can export xmps but those XMP

113
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,419
is loaded or converted will not yield

114
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,280
the exact same results on a different

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,699
software

116
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,660
Lightroom is incredibly fast every

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,300
change you make is instantaneous

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,180
importing comparing exporting is

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,940
lightning fast something that dark table

120
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,100
sucks so much at

121
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
there we go every tweak requires

122
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,560
recomputation

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,020
whereas Lightroom processes everything

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,180
much faster

125
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,940
Lightroom also has a benefit of being an

126
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,620
adobe software

127
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,259
which includes support Cloud features

128
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,600
and interoperability

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,699
there's like what mobile Lightroom for

130
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,580
iPad than others you can take your

131
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,620
presets on the go and use them to

132
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,720
develop your roll captures you shot on

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
your phone and lastly Lightroom is

134
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,360
incredibly intuitive all the complexity

135
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,000
is hidden and automated for you so you

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,860
don't need to become a color scientist

137
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,380
to be able to develop a photo I think

138
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,479
that is an incredible selling point

139
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,280
especially for hobbyists

140
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,280
now I'm going to get attacked by fans of

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,620
both software just because I didn't

142
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,340
mention this obscure use case or that

143
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,280
obscure feature the fact is you can get

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,460
excellent results with both applications

145
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,620
one group of users will prefer Lightroom

146
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,380
due to its sheer quality of life and

147
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,139
speed other group of users will prefer

148
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,020
dark table due to its Advanced refined

149
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,900
control of the image forming process and

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,919
pixel pipeline

151
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,240
and now it's time to say something

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,180
rather controversial I think dark table

153
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,419
is a better piece of software for both

154
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,539
professionals and hobbyists

155
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,520
professionals will find it incredibly

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,800
liberating having the amount of control

157
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,259
of every step of their development

158
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,660
pipeline thanks to the work of color

159
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,600
conscious developers dark tables tools

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,060
are incredibly aware of what they do to

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,400
color preventing Hue shifts drifts

162
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
clipping and other mathematical nonsense

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,580
everything can break if you push it too

164
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,100
far however going back to my silly rally

165
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,280
car analogy dark table is much easier to

166
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,039
drive into a wall hobbyists such as

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,280
myself might find dark table

168
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,099
inspirational I know I did it reignited

169
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,099
my curiosity and I wanted to learn more

170
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,919
I wanted to build and develop my photos

171
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,500
not just tweak them I wanted to feel

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
that I'm creating each and every

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,099
Captured Moment

174
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,780
table filled this desire at 110 percent

175
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,720
it's an excellent tool for education and

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,240
tinkering and will very likely reignite

177
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,660
a smoldering love for photography lastly

178
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,780
dark table is yours the developers

179
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,180
kindly provide the software with a gpl3

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,319
license

181
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,300
which means you can download it

182
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,139
and once you do it's yours no update is

183
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,720
no license service no compatibility

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,419
issues the fact that dark table is open

185
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,940
source is difficult to believe as the

186
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,220
software is incredibly stable and

187
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,380
Incredibly powerful it is absolutely

188
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,900
ready for professional use and it gets

189
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,180
better by the month I really do think

190
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,520
it's an underrated piece of software and

191
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,620
I really think that every person who has

192
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,379
true nerdy passion for photography

193
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,840
should give it a try and not just run

194
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
the software and move a couple of

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,640
Sliders but give it a real go use it for

196
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,979
a week watch some tutorials read some

197
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,140
documentation promise you're going to

198
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,820
have a difficult time going back to

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,839
Lightroom

200
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,620
or not

201
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,279
so that's the rundown of the two very

202
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,500
different software packages I've avoided

203
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,839
comparing them side to side as there's

204
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,360
no point in doing so as I mentioned

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,600
before both can perform very well and it

206
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,640
would be impossible to say which photo

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,459
was made with Lightroom and which one

208
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,740
was made with dark table comparing them

209
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,980
side by side is absolutely useless oh

210
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,080
yeah and if you made it this far don't

211
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
forget to subscribe maybe show this

212
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,399
video to your nerdy friend that might be

213
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
interested in pushing their photography

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,899
skills to the next level I'll see you

215
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,910
soon bye

216
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,200
