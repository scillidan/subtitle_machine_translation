00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,359
hello welcome back for the part 3 of the

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,000
deepish dive into filmic rgb in this

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
video i'm going to be attempting to

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,759
develop a tricky capture

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,080
a capture where we have the sun shining

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
through the very colorful petals

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,720
as well as this huge area that's in the

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
shadow the goal or intention of the

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,640
final image is going to be one

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
make the photo feel warm as the sky is

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
clear and we have a lovely sunshine two

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
make the tree look colorful

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
try to convey the feeling that it was

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,079
incredibly colorful without making it

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
look deep fried

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,559
and three maintain the contrast as much

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
as possible since it was a bright and

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
sunny day i want to convey the strong

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
shadows that were present that day

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
i don't want the final image to look

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,960
flat or hdr like

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
and this might take some time

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
okay the image is loaded i'll make a

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
duplicate

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,959
and i'll also take a snapshot so we can

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
compare it later

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,960
let's go straight to filmic rgb

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,159
options

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,000
let's get rid of the prominence

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
preservation

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,520
this will immediately get rid of some of

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
the artifacts

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
that we can see around this pole

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
if i turn back to max rgb

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,439
you will see there are a couple of weird

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
straight lines

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
and of course the the great big glaring

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
magenta sun

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
if we turn that off

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
you'll see that the issue is no longer

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,040
there

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
again we're sacrificing the preservation

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
of the rgb ratios but we are preserving

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
the feeling of brightness smooth

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
gradients and overall a more natural

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
feeling let's not forget we're doing

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
creative photography here if i had to do

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
brand work that include brand colors in

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,560
photography or cg renders i would

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
possibly consider using the max rgb

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
preservation method however what we're

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,479
doing here is far from it and trying to

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
scan the real world is not my priority

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
my priority is a good image a good

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
picture a good photo

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
if one wants to get the best experience

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,680
of

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
being there i suggest google street view

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
while we're at it i'm not a big fan of

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
mark's rgb preservation method being the

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
default so let's change that really

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
quickly

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
click on the burger menu store new

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
preset call it

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,720
no

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
preservation

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
and auto apply this preset to matching

68
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
images and leave the settings at the

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
default

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
this will apply this preset to every

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
image that's entering darkroom

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,640
okay

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
now that we got that out of the way

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,640
let's get back to developing

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
we'll jump to exposure

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
and increase it quite a bit

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
so about here

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
now that we can see what we're working

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,879
on i can go to color calibration

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
and adjust the temperature first let's

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
turn on the color assessment mode

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
set the illuminant to d

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
daylight

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,239
and adjust the temperature

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
my goal here is to get as neutral colors

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
as possible

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,799
we'll worry about warmth

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,120
a bit later

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
okay that looks about right now we can

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
jump back to filmic rgb

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
we've lost a bit of visual contrast when

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
we increase the exposure

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
so i would like to bring some of that

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
back let's move to the look tab

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
first i would like to reduce the

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,519
latitude to a minimum

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
that will give us a bit more flexibility

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
with the contrast as well as give us

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
smoother transitions between shadows

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
tones and highlights

101
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,159
now increase the contrast

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,959
until i am happy

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,880
okay 1.5 seems to be the magic number

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
let's do a couple of slight adjustments

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
to the white and black relative exposure

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,840
i need less details and highlights

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,479
and more details in shadows

108
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
let's decrease the white relative

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
exposure

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,919
i'll zoom in a little bit

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
that's too much

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
okay that looks about right and in the

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
shadows

114
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,040
i will increase

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
or decrease depending on how you look at

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,040
it i will push this slider to the left

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
it's about here

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,199
now we might have set the contrast

119
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,440
correctly but our project still looks

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
dull and uninteresting

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
we're going to need to do some color

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
work

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
for that let's jump to color balance rgb

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
module

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
we have three elements in this photo the

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
plant

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
the house and the sky

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
i would like to control the color of the

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
plant and the sky separately so let's

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
separate them in a quick and dirty way

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
i will select the plant based on its

132
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
color as we have nothing else in our

133
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,320
frame that's of this violet hue

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
let's jump to the parametric mask

135
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,639
section

136
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
i'll use the picker to draw a window

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
where we have a lot of this hue

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,280
we can enable the mask preview

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
okay so we selected a lot of this plant

140
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
and a bit of the roof

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
but that's just because it is reflecting

142
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,160
this aggressive violet color

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
i'll add a bit of feathering

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
and a bit of blurring

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
i did say it was quick and dirty

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
okay that will do

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
unfortunately most of the plant is in

148
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
the shadow but i want to be able to

149
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
control the color with higher

150
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
granularity which means i'm going to set

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,919
the shadows the mid-tones and the

152
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,000
highlights a bit further down in the

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
shadows

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,400
for that let's go to the masks tab

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
first i know i want the strongest

156
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
separation between the highlights and

157
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,479
the shadows therefore i will make the

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,560
shadow and the highlight fall of curves

159
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,560
steeper

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
like that

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
like that

162
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
we can enable each mask and see what we

163
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,160
get

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
masks shows us that there's still too

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
much of the plant in the shadow because

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
almost all of it is selected and

167
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,639
non-transparent

168
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,960
the mid-tone mask reveals that there's

169
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
almost nothing in the mid tones except a

170
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
bit of the plant around the edges

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,720
lastly the highlights mass reveals that

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
the highlights are just around the edge

173
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
of the plant

174
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
so we want to adjust the middle gray

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,840
fulcrum

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
and see more of the plant gets included

177
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,319
in the highlights

178
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
and

179
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,639
less of the plant gets included in the

180
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
shadows

181
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,639
and you can also see our mid-tones slide

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,080
around the image

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
in a wave

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,039
this is an excellent tool i love it

185
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,000
okay we have our mask set we have our

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
shadows here

187
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
highlights here and everything in

188
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,520
between is the midtones

189
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
now we can go back to the master tab

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
now i can increase the chroma to make

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,120
the plant feel a bit more colorful

192
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,879
and that will make our plant feel

193
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
brighter as well that's due to something

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
called

195
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,639
the

196
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
schoolhouse effect i'll link that in the

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
description now i have to be really

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,960
careful here

199
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,759
i want to make the plant feel colorful

200
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
without making it look uncanny or

201
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
overcooked this is exactly why i

202
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
separated the sky and the house from the

203
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
plant the context of a color is very

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
important

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
if we have too many saturated colors in

206
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
the image it will become a sensory

207
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
overload and it will look flat

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
the feeling of colorfulness is not

209
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
created by pumping the saturation value

210
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
to the max it just has to be more

211
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
colorful compared to its surroundings

212
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
that's why i'm going to

213
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,800
increase the global chroma i'm going to

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,320
decrease the chroma in the highlights

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
quite drastically

216
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,839
and i'm going to pump the chroma in the

217
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,320
shadows

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,320
and i might want to adjust the

219
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,360
perceptual brilliance just a little bit

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
so our plant

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
is a little bit lighter

222
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
now let's make a new instance of the

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
color rgb module and let's take care of

224
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
the sky

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
again let's enable the parametric mask

226
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,920
let's go to the

227
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
hue channel

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and let's select a large area of the sky

229
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,240
i'll enable the mask preview

230
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
okay again feathering radius

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120
blurring radius

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
and that will do for us

233
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
the accuracy doesn't matter too much

234
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
here we're not doing anything radical

235
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,440
just slight adjustments first i will

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
shift the hue slightly so it contrasts

237
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,519
with the plant

238
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,880
right now i feel that the sky

239
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
is a bit too purple

240
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
the hue slide is really sensitive so

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
it's best to

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,120
take small steps

243
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,360
okay

244
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
that looks

245
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,000
that looks good

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
we'll give it a bit more chroma

247
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
so we have a nice gradient between the

248
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
edge of the image

249
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,399
and the center of the sun

250
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
remember the gradient is how we convey

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
brightness

252
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
okay i think we nailed the contrast and

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,279
the colorfulness

254
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,240
but our overall image still feels a bit

255
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,480
cold you know what to do

256
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
create another color balance rgb

257
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
instance

258
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
this time let's go to the four ways tab

259
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
adjust the hue in the highlights gain to

260
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
something warm

261
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
and increase the chroma ever so slightly

262
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
we can zoom in

263
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,480
into our sun and check before

264
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
and after

265
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,440
zoom out

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
before and after

267
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
i think after looks much nicer

268
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
now

269
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,079
did we manage to achieve our intentions

270
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
so number one

271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
did we make the photo feel warm with

272
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
bright sun and clear blue sky

273
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
i'm pretty sure we did

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,800
two did we make the tree look colorful

275
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,920
let's say 50 50 on this one

276
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
we could push more global brilliance

277
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
but we're risking breaking the balance

278
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,639
of the image

279
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
i think it's best to keep it this way

280
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,760
and three did we maintain the contrast

281
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
as much as possible

282
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
i'd say yes i tried to resist pushing

283
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,079
the exposure more and the difference

284
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
between the bright and the dark is

285
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,600
enough to make the image not look

286
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,680
flat we can compare our image to what

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
we've started with

288
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
i think the image is saved and will

289
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
serve its purpose as an example for this

290
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,880
tutorial

291
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,040
and a reminder of the lovely time i had

292
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,399
that day taking photos that's it i think

293
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
i've touched everything i wanted to

294
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
touch regarding the filmic rgb module

295
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
and a bit more

296
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
fun was had discussions were started

297
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
people were informed i thank you for

298
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
your time watching this hope you learned

299
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,959
something new and hope to see you next

300
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,680
time bye
