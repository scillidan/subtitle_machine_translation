1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be using path

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,639
effects and inkscape to show you how you

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:05,279
can add these decorative elements to

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,280
your text known as swashes and to follow

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,400
along with what I'm doing here you'll

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,280
need to download and install this font

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,480
which I will have Linked In the

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
description below so let's get started

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,039
uh I'm going to grab my text tool and

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to write on the canvas swashes

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,039
just for this demonstration and I'm

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,960
going to open up my text editor so let

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,240
me grab my text menu and I'm going to

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,119
look for that font that I already have

15
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,960
installed click apply

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,879
and I'm going to scale this up a little

17
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,200
bit I'm going to hold control while I'm

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,680
doing that so that it locks the

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,760
proportions and preserves the aspect

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,120
ratio and what I will do now is I will

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,760
convert this to a path so I'll go I will

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,640
go to path object to path and I'll split

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,760
the letters apart so I will go to path

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
and choose split

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,719
path and now it is individual letters so

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,719
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

27
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,239
the pencil tool to manually draw lines

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,640
coming off of these letters here to show

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,079
you what I mean uh I was able to draw a

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,600
line that comes off the top of this

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,040
letter H and swoops underneath like that

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
uh we can do that with the pencil tool

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
by just drawing a regular plain line and

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,080
then we're going to use path effects to

35
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,640
make the line look like it's consistent

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
with the style of the text so I'm going

37
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,840
to grab the P the pencil tool over here

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,360
you can access it by pressing the letter

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
P on the keyboard I'm going to use the

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
regular mode the standard uh regular

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
mode for this what I'm doing here and

42
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,560
then over here where it says smoothing

43
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm going to set that to 50 for now you

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,079
may have to adjust this based on the

45
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,040
size of your text on your screen so I'm

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,520
going to start with those settings and

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm just going to click and drag to draw

48
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,320
a line like this that swoops around and

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
goes under the text like that and what

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
you can do now is you can grab your

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,399
nodes tool and adjust to these nodes so

52
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,759
that it looks a little more smooth you

53
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,520
may have to delete nodes if you have too

54
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,960
many of them if you drew like a very

55
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,719
shaky line uh like the fewer nodes you

56
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,159
have the smoother of a line you get so

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,439
I'm going to try deleting some of these

58
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,520
nodes and seeing if that gives me a

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,560
better result so I'm just going to

60
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,280
adjust this a little bit

61
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,000
and the idea here is that you want this

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
line going consistent with the direction

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,160
of this part of the letter H so you want

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,878
this to be nice and consistent so let me

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,680
adjust this a little

66
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,200
more and I'm happy with how that looks

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,360
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,920
adjust this a little bit so I'll grab my

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
selection tool I'm going to move this up

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,640
a little bit and I may even rotate this

71
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,599
around a tiny bit as well just so it has

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,640
more of a uh consistent Direction there

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,760
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

74
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,840
going to grab the power stroke path

75
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
effects let me open up my path effects

76
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,200
menu by going to path and selecting path

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,480
effects and I'm going to look for Power

78
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,440
Stroke so I'll just type in pwe and

79
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,519
there it is right there power stroke and

80
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,319
with power stroke applied I can grab my

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,239
nodes tool and you'll see these pink

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,000
handles now on the path once you apply

83
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,879
the power stroke and you can use these

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
pink handles to change the width of the

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
line at that particular point so I'm

86
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,599
going to make this line a little more

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,400
consistent with this part of the letter

88
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
H if you notice here there's a little

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,680
bit of a like a little bit of a corner a

90
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,319
little bit of a dip don't worry about

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,519
that we're going to go correct that

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,159
later we're just looking to get a

93
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,000
general consistency here I'm going to

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,640
take this node and change this as well

95
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,720
you may notice that when you're doing

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
this you end up with like this sort of

97
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,959
effect right here if you're doing that

98
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,879
then just move the node or move the

99
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,480
handle back to the other side of the

100
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,760
line and you should have a better result

101
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,959
and I'm going to take this one and bring

102
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,680
this one out like that or I may have to

103
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,640
bring this one

104
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,920
up and I'll adjust this a little bit

105
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,040
and the good thing about this is that

106
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,319
you can change the direction of your uh

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,239
nodes still while you're doing this so

108
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
nothing is finalized just yet so let me

109
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,280
zoom out and see how this looks in

110
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,760
comparison um you want to make the the

111
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,200
uh weight of the swashes consistent with

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,040
the weight of the letters so I noticed

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
this is a little too little too heavy so

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
I'll bring that down a little

115
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,159
bit there we go I like how that looks

116
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,640
right

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,920
there and I'm going to grab my selection

118
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,280
tool now and I'm just going to to change

119
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
the position of this a little more I may

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
want to rotate this around just a little

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
more just to match the direction of that

122
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
letter and I'll bring this down some a

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
little

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,239
bit and that looks pretty good I think

125
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm going to leave that just as it is

126
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,879
and I'm going to come over here and draw

127
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,200
another one now so let me come over here

128
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
to my pencil tool and again I'm going to

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
follow the the direction of the letter

130
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,639
and just draw my line you may have to

131
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,360
try a couple of times cuz I just messed

132
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,919
that one up right there I'm going to

133
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,880
press command Z or control Z to undo

134
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,440
that and try again

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
okay that one's a little better I'm

136
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
going to grab my nodes tool now and I'm

137
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,160
going to delete some of these extra

138
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,280
nodes in here like I don't need this one

139
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,120
oops let me try that again I don't need

140
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
that

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,240
one and I'm going to adjust these ones a

142
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,440
little

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,440
bit okay so I think that's looking a lot

144
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,960
better now like I mentioned earlier the

145
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,320
fewer nodes you have the smoother the

146
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
line is so you want to have as few nodes

147
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,520
in there as possible so now that that's

148
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
done let me go to back to my uh path

149
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,080
effects and I'm going to apply another

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,560
power

151
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,479
stroke and now I can grab my nodes tool

152
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,080
and adjust the size of the uh or adjust

153
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,800
the weight of the

154
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,280
line okay so let me grab my selection

155
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,000
tool now and position this I'll put this

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,440
up a little

157
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,360
more there we go that looks a lot better

158
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,919
and one final touch I'll add here is

159
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,479
I'll add another swash to the letter W

160
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,120
so let me repeat that same process I'm

161
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,479
going to grab my pencil tool I'll just

162
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,680
press the letter P on the keyboard draw

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
my

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
line and now I will just reposition this

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
one as well okay so let's address the um

166
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,919
these little Corners that show up these

167
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,800
little inconsistencies where the swashes

168
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
connect with the letters to fix that

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,199
select the swash and then I'm going to

171
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,680
hold shift and select the letter and I'm

172
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
just going to unify them together before

173
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,880
I do that though I do have to warn you

174
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,400
that once you do this this effect will

175
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
be finalized and this will become a

176
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,720
regular path you won't be able to change

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,080
the consistency or the the weight of the

178
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
line or the direction of it anymore

179
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,000
without editing the nodes uh so just to

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,240
warn you there make sure everything

181
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,919
looks good before you do this next step

182
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,520
and then go to path

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,479
Union and now what I'm going to do to

184
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,680
smooth this out I'm just going to grab

185
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,599
my nodes tool and I'll just go in there

186
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,280
and delete those nodes and when you

187
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,680
delete those nodes you can take these

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
handles and straighten them out and you

189
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,479
have a nice a nice smooth line there so

190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,840
let me do the same thing over here I'll

191
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,599
delete these nodes and now we have a

192
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,199
nice smooth line and I'll do the same

193
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,280
thing over here I'm going to grab my

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,560
selection tool I'm going to select all

195
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,039
of these by holding shift and clicking

196
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,560
on them all three objects go to path

197
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Union and I will do the same thing over

198
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,759
here I'm going to delete these nodes out

199
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,960
of here

200
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,520
now one final thing I wanted to address

201
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,919
with this design is that if you notice

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,039
the tips of these swashes they end in

203
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,280
sharp points and that's not consistent

204
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,479
with the rest of these letters these

205
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,639
letters for the most part have rounded

206
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,319
caps on them so what I'm going to do is

207
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm going to grab my Eraser and erase

208
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,759
the ends of these uh the the ends of

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,800
these points so there's actually a few

210
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,199
ways to do this for this I'm just using

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,599
the Eraser I'm going to grab the Eraser

212
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,960
tool I'm going to set the width to 20

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,160
okay let me try that again eraser tool

214
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,919
set the width to

215
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,560
20 and I'm just going to erase off part

216
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,599
of this letter right here like

217
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,800
that and now I'm going to grab my nodes

218
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,080
tool I'm going to select these nodes get

219
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,280
rid of them select all these nodes in

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
the middle here not the ones on the ends

221
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,039
just the ones in the middle get rid of

222
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,599
them and then we can take this line or

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,159
take these nodes and pull this out like

224
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,639
that and now we have a rounded cap on

225
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,639
there like I said there's various ways

226
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,960
to do this you can draw a bezier path

227
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,720
and do a path difference and then

228
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,759
reshape it this way but this is just the

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,039
way I'm doing it for this tutorial I'm

230
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,840
just using the Eraser I'll do the same

231
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,520
thing over here you have to select the

232
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
object first then grab the Eraser and

233
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,080
then you can draw right through there

234
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,039
and erase that off so I'll just go

235
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,720
through and erase this

236
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,159
and there we go that looks a lot more

237
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
consistent with the rest of the letters

238
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,958
so I think that should do it for this

239
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,640
tutorial that's how you can take text

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
and add some decorative elements known

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,958
as swashes to it using path effects in

242
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,399
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

243
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,160
then consider checking out my inkscape

244
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,440
master class it's a collection of over

245
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,240
60 videos where I go over all of the

246
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
tools and features in inkscape and I

247
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,800
explain what they are and demonstrate

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
how they work kind of like how I did in

249
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
this video we even have a private

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320

membership fees you just pay $17 one

254
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,399
time and you're in for Life I'll have

255
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,760
some information about that down below

256
