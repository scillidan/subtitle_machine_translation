00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
this is nick with logos by nick.com and

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
in this tutorial i'll be demonstrating

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
how you can add some simple shading to

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
your vector illustrations

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,039
using inkscape this is a nice little

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,560
touch you can add to your designs to

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
make them pop a little more

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
and if you don't have an example design

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
to try this out with then i'll have a

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
download link in the description of the

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,439
video

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,359
if you want to practice on this example

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,880
design that i'm using here

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,399
but before we get started if you'd like

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,920
to learn more about inkscape be sure to

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
check out my inkscape master class

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
it's a collection of over 60 videos

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
where i go over all of the tools and

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,239
features in inkscape

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,680
and i explain what they are and

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
demonstrate how they work i'll have a

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
link in the description

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
of the video if you want to check that

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
out so getting started here on escape as

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
you can see i have the software open the

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
first thing we want to do is just make

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
sure we have our snapping enabled

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
up here the top icon in the very top

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
left that says

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
enable snapping make sure that's turned

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
on we want to come over here to where it

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,359
says

33
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,879
snap to custom nodes make sure that's

34
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
enabled and then snap to

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
smooth nodes as well and what i'm going

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
to do now is i'm going to import this

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
example design i have it downloaded here

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
in this folder

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,960
i'm just going to click and drag this

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
onto the canvas like that i'm going to

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
click ok to leave the default settings

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,119
as they are

43
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
and there's this example shark design

44
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
that i'm going to be working with

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
now let me come up here to where it says

46
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
view make sure you have custom selected

47
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
go to zoom zoom in at one to one

48
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,000
and now i'm just going to hold ctrl and

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
shift with the select tool here hold

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
ctrl and shift and grab one of these

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,000
arrows

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,880
and scale this down now for this

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
tutorial you don't have to necessarily

54
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,360
follow this step

55
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,240
what i'm going to do is i'm just going

56
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
to right click this and go to duplicate

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,119
and i'm going to apply this to a

58
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,479
duplicate copy over here

59
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,840
i'm going to leave this one over here

60
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
the original so that i can show you the

61
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,079
difference

62
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,159
between the finished design and how it

63
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,000
was previously just to show you how well

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
it makes the design look

65
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
so i have this design over here what i

66
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,119
want to do now is just

67
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,320
ungroup this i'm going to come up here

68
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
to where it says ungroup ungroup

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
selected objects click on that

70
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
you may want to click on that just a few

71
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,719
times just to make sure that there's not

72
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
several layers of groupings there and

73
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
now we can click off and deselect

74
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,038
everything what i'm looking at here

75
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,800
is i'm just going to imagine a light

76
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
source being over here on the canvas

77
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,040
right here

78
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
shining light going this way so like on

79
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
this side of the design

80
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,120
the right side will be like a glow or

81
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
like a highlight effect

82
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
and over here will be a shading or a

83
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,760
shadow effect

84
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
so let me zoom in on this by holding

85
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
ctrl and rolling up the mouse wheel

86
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,319
and if you want to move the page around

87
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,599
at any point you can just press down the

88
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
mouse wheel and move the mouse

89
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,080
what i'm going to do is i'm just going

90
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
to manually draw a shaded a shaded area

91
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
right here i'm going to grab the bezier

92
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
pen which is right here with the

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
snapping enabled as it is there i'm just

94
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
going to snap to this cusp node right

95
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,920
there

96
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
click and then come down here and click

97
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
down here into this blue area

98
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
and then i'm going to bring the line

99
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
going through this blue area here

100
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,800
back to the starting point oops

101
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
back to the starting point like that

102
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
make sure you're going through the dark

103
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
blue area the whole time

104
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
and now i want to open up the fill and

105
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
stroke menu which is over here fill in

106
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,319
stroke

107
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,159
or you can press ctrl shift and f on the

108
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
keyboard and for the fill color

109
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
i want to make this the same shade of

110
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
blue that this light shade of blue is

111
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,040
here only

112
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
slightly darker so to do this i'm

113
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,560
actually going to use the dropper tool

114
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
first i'm going to come over here to

115
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,519
where it says pick colors from an image

116
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,239
or you could press d

117
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
on the keyboard and just go ahead and

118
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
grab a sample selection

119
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
from that there and where it says fill

120
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,720
in the fill tab

121
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
i'm looking for hsl and in the l

122
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
row i'm going to take this and bring

123
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
this to the left a little bit just to

124
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,480
make that a little darker

125
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
and i'm actually going to change the

126
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,799
shade of that blue a little bit i'm

127
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,840
going to take this

128
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
i'm going to take this atro and just

129
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
slide this though right a little bit

130
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,959
just to make that pop out a little more

131
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,239
and i want to get rid of that black

132
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
outline so i'm going to hold shift and

133
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
click this red x in the bottom left

134
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
corner

135
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,760
and now what i want to do is grab the

136
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
select tool and i want to lower this

137
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
beneath these blue objects so i'm going

138
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
to come up here to where it says

139
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,040
lower selection one step click that once

140
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,159
again

141
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
again and again until it goes beneath

142
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,599
these objects over here

143
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,040
now instead of using this button what i

144
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
like to do is use the keyboard shortcut

145
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,200
which is

146
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
page down so i'm just going to press

147
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
page down until it goes beneath

148
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
everything like that

149
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
or maybe not that far okay perfect right

150
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
there once you've done that

151
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
just take your your edit pads by nodes

152
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
tool and take this line and just

153
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,160
manually click and drag it in

154
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
so that it follows a similar contour to

155
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
this blue this dark blue line right here

156
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,639
and if you go to the select one you zoom

157
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,160
back out you'll notice you've we've

158
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
added a little bit of shading right

159
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,479
there

160
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,160
now i'm going to take this and make this

161
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
a little lighter i don't want it quite

162
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
that dark that looks a little better

163
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
and i'm going to go through and do the

164
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
same thing right here i'm going to add

165
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,199
another shape

166
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
by the fin right here let me grab the

167
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
bezier pen

168
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
i'm going to start right here bring the

169
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
line right here

170
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,759
then over here and then through the blue

171
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
areas the dark blue out

172
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
the dark blue areas until it's back to

173
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
the starting point like that

174
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
fill it in with this shade right here so

175
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
i'm going to grab the dropper fill that

176
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
in

177
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
get rid of the black outline by shift

178
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,479
clicking the x

179
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,000
back to the select tool and again i'm

180
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,320
using page down until it goes beneath

181
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
those dark blue areas and now i'm going

182
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
to grab the edit paths by

183
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,320
nose tool and then just adjust this so

184
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
that these lines follow the contour of

185
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
these lines over here

186
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,479
and that right there is what i'm looking

187
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
for let me zoom out a little bit that's

188
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
looking pretty good

189
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
so now i'm going to draw another one

190
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
right here i'm going to be i'm going to

191
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
use the keyboard shortcuts now and work

192
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
a little bit faster so i'm going to grab

193
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,840
the bezier pen

194
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
again over here b on the keyboard to

195
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
grab that i'm going to start right here

196
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
at this corner

197
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
bring the line up here like that and

198
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
then through

199
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
the dark blue area

200
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
back to the starting point press d on

201
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
the keyboard to grab the dropper

202
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
make that the same color get rid of the

203
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
outline by shift-clicking the red x

204
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
and now i'm going to grab the edit paths

205
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
by nodes tool by pressing

206
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,039
n on the keyboard and i'll just take

207
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
this and drag this in

208
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
you know what let me go back to the

209
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
select tool and lower this down i'm

210
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
going to press page down on the keyboard

211
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
a few times there we go

212
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
and now i can go back to the nodes tool

213
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
and i can click on this node right here

214
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,600
the corner node

215
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,880
and then i can get these little handles

216
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
that'll make it easier for me to adjust

217
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,319
so i want to adjust these handles so

218
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
that this shadow is following the

219
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
contour

220
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
of the shoulder here or the dark blue

221
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
border

222
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
that's looking pretty good right there

223
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
as you can see

224
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
i'm gonna do the same thing down here

225
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
only i'm gonna make this shadow

226
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
follow this this side right here so let

227
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
me grab the bezier pen again

228
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
same steps as before i'm going to end

229
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
this one right about here i'm not going

230
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
to take this all the way to the end

231
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
right here i'll put it right about here

232
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
back through the starting point through

233
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
the dark blue areas

234
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
there we go make it the same color get

235
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
rid of the outline lower it down

236
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
with page down and then back to the

237
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
nodes tool

238
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
and we can adjust this further and make

239
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,160
it fit

240
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
make it a little more fluid now you may

241
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
want to temporarily

242
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
disable snapping while you're doing this

243
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,319
to do that you can just come up here

244
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,440
and click on that because there's

245
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,639
sometimes you're going to want to adjust

246
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,440
these handles

247
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,960
and the snapping gets in the way so you

248
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
can temporarily turn that off if you

249
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
want to adjust these handles

250
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
like i'm doing here and then if you want

251
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,759
to turn it back on you could just press

252
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,199
you can just click this button or what i

253
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,880
like to do is use the keyboard shortcut

254
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,360
which is

255
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
shift and five and there we go now it's

256
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
enabled again

257
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
so looking at this illustration here

258
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,479
we're going to want to apply

259
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,440
this shadow effect maybe

260
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
maybe over here where the thumb is and

261
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
then after that

262
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
we'll have the shadows applied to the

263
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
left side of the design

264
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
and then we're going to work on adding

265
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,840
highlights to the right side of the

266
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
design so let me just go through and

267
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,960
finish up the shadows really quick

268
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,840
okay so i've gone through and i've added

269
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
some shadows to the left side of the

270
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
design now i'm going to add some

271
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,319
highlights to the right side of the

272
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
design and i'm going to start up here

273
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,919
with the shark's head up here because as

274
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,360
we're imagining this light source is

275
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
coming over here from the right and

276
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
shining this way so

277
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
let me grab the bezier pen again let me

278
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
turn snapping back on and i want to snap

279
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
to this corner

280
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
i'm going to create the shot the

281
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
highlight right here going along the top

282
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,199
of the head here

283
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
snap it back to the starting point over

284
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
here

285
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
bring it through the border the dark

286
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
blue border

287
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
whoops didn't mean to do that

288
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,520
and back to the starting point

289
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,039
and for this one i'm going to use a

290
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,640
lighter shade instead of a darker shade

291
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
so let me grab the dropper

292
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
make this the same shade of blue only

293
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,519
i'm going to make this one a little

294
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,479
lighter

295
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
like that let's get rid of the outline

296
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
or the stroke go back to the select tool

297
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
page down a few times to lower it

298
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
beneath the eye

299
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
and beneath the dark blue area now we

300
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
can grab the edit pads by nodes tool

301
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,959
i'm going to turn off snapping for this

302
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,480
part because i know for a fact that it's

303
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
going to get in the way

304
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
take this node down here adjust this

305
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
that's looking pretty good i just want

306
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
to get this out of the way of the eye

307
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
right here so i'm going to double click

308
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
i'm actually going to double click right

309
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
here to add a new node

310
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
and then just bring that up like that

311
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,839
that didn't come out

312
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,680
quite as well as i'd like so let me undo

313
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
that to undo i'm just going to hit ctrl

314
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,519
z a couple of times

315
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
and let me raise this back to the top i

316
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
want to add this node right here

317
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
there we go and now i can go ahead and

318
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
lower this down

319
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,839
that's what i'm looking for right there

320
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,279
that's looking pretty good so i'm going

321
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,720
to add another highlight going right

322
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,760
here

323
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
now since this area is white i'm just

324
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
going to use a more vibrant shade of

325
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
light blue for this highlight although

326
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
it's technically

327
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
technically if this were like gray you

328
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
would use white right here but since

329
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,240
this is already white i'm just going to

330
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
use a different

331
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
like a more vibrant blue like this so

332
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,000
let me grab the bezier pen again

333
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
i'm going to start over here i'm

334
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
actually going to start up here let me

335
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,200
turn snapping back i'm going to start at

336
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,240
this corner

337
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
and i'll come through here like this

338
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
let me turn off snapping after i've

339
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
connected to that point

340
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,920
there we go back through this area right

341
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
here

342
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
and i want to make this probably the

343
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
same shade of this maybe a little

344
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
lighter so let me grab the dropper

345
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,200
there we go get rid of the outline let's

346
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
lower this down

347
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
there we go grab the nodes tool and then

348
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
just make this follow the contour of

349
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,480
that

350
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
i actually got to lower that down some

351
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
more that's still sticking out

352
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
there we go and i want to make that a

353
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,399
little lighter that's a little too dark

354
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
for a little too dark for it to be a

355
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,839
highlight like that that looks pretty

356
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,640
good right there

357
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,760
so now i'm going to create another one

358
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
going through the teeth right here let

359
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,839
me grab the bezier pen

360
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
right through there and then right

361
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
through here like this

362
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
back to the starting point make this the

363
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
same color with the dropper tool

364
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
get rid of the stroke and then lower it

365
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
down

366
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,959
like that and as you can see it's it's

367
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
really coming to life here so what i'm

368
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
going to do is i'm going to add a few

369
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
more highlights through here

370
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,320
maybe right here on the right side of

371
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
the shoulder and then over here at the

372
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,560
top of the knuckles over here and maybe

373
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
right there as well i'll have to see how

374
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
it looks so let me go through and do

375
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,519
that real quick

376
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,399
okay so as you can see i finished up

377
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,760
adding my highlights

378
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
to the right side and the top side of

379
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
the areas of the design here and whether

380
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,959
or not this is actually correct like

381
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,440
this is

382
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
how the light would actually interact

383
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,880
with the subject like this

384
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
i don't know probably not but it still

385
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
looks good enough for it to be effective

386
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
and to make the design pop a little more

387
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
let me zoom back out here

388
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
to show you what i mean i'm going to

389
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,399
take this original design and i'm going

390
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,760
to put it right next to it

391
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
and as you can see there is a clear

392
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
difference there this design just seems

393
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
more alive it seems to pop a little more

394
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
it just looks like a

395
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
like a higher quality illustration just

396
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
with some simple

397
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
shading and highlights drawn with the

398
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
bezier pen like that

399
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
so that is how you can go about adding

400
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
some highlights and shadows and

401
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
shading features to your simple

402
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,839
illustrations using inkscape

403
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
