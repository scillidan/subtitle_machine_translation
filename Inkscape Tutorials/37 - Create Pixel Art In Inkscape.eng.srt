1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,319
you can trace pixel art from images

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,799
using inkscape now there is a built-in

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
feature for auto tracing your pixel art

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
but it doesn't always produce the

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,960
desired results in these instances it

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,799
would be good to know how to trace pixel

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,800
art manually which we'll be going over

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,680
in today's tutorial

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,309
[Music]

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,359
so getting us started here in inkscape

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,560
the first thing you'll want to do is

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
import the graphic that you'd like to

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
trace over into inkscape as you can see

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
that i've done here now for this

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,520
demonstration i will be using this

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
vector illustration of a fox that i

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
downloaded from 123rf.com

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
so once you have your graphic imported

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,079
let's turn on the grid let's come up

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,920
here to where it says view

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
and where it says page grid go ahead and

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
select that

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,520
now by default your grid should be one

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,840
pixel by one pixel in size but we can

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
ensure that by going to document

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
properties so let's come up here to file

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
and go to document properties

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
and then come over here to the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
grids tab

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
and then down here where it says spacing

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,520
x and spacing y it should be one and one

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
by default if yours isn't one and one go

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
ahead and change that so that your grid

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
is spaced out one pixel by one pixel and

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
the end result of that if you zoom in

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,759
i'm going to hold ctrl and roll up my

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
mouse wheel if you zoom in you can see

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,159
all of the individual pixels represented

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,600
by these grid lines here we're going to

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
use these grid lines as a reference for

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
tracing over our image so let me zoom

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
back out here

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,479
what i want to do now is take my graphic

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
and scale it down really small i want to

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
scale it down so small that one pixel

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
squares that will will seem large in

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
comparison to it so i'm going to grab

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,759
the transformation handle here i'm going

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
to hold control on my keyboard to lock

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
the proportions and i'm going to scale

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,439
this down pretty small maybe down to

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
like um

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
i don't know 150 pixels wide and you

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
could see what the width is while you're

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
scaling by referencing the toolbar the

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
tool settings menu towards the top of

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,759
the screen so i'm going to set mine

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
right at about 150 and that that right

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
there looks good now let me zoom in on

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,119
this

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
as you can see these individual squares

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
here we're going to create boxes that

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,640
fill these squares

65
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
in the color of the graphic beneath it

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
and then it's going to create like a

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
pixel effect beneath it so let me just

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,599
reposition this a little bit i want this

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,599
i want the tip of the fox's nose here up

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
against this square grid line

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,440
there we go so now let's go ahead and

72
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
create our initial box what we want to

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
do first is enable snapping which is up

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,080
here this little magnet icon turn that

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
on and then from this drop down menu

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
where it says uh bounding boxes and

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
nodes we want those two enabled but we

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
don't want alignment enabled that's the

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
settings we want right now

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
so i'm going to grab my rectangle tool

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
and i'm just going to click and drag

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
like this to create a box it should snap

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
to the grid lines nice and evenly as you

84
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,599
saw here and once you've done that you

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
can disable the node setting in the uh

86
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
snapping options we're going to leave

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
we're going to leave bounding boxes

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
enabled but for the rest of this

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
tutorial we're going to leave these two

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
disabled and now i'm going to take this

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,239
i'm going to grab my dropper i'm going

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
to make this the same color as the fox's

93
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
nose like that and now i'll grab my

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,680
selection tool and i'll just snap that

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
in there like that

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
let me zoom in a little bit now to

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
duplicate that i'm going to press ctrl d

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,760
on the keyboard and i'm going to move

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
this copy over here

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
and if you want to stamp copies while

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
you're doing this you could just hold

102
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
the click and then press the space bar

103
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
and it'll stamp a copy like that and

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
i'll put another one down here for the

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,879
fox's nose like that and i'll just leave

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
that one there

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,920
okay so now i'm going to duplicate this

108
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
again i'm going to press ctrl d to

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
duplicate this i want to make this one

110
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
the same color as this shade right here

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,680
so i'm going to grab my dropper again

112
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
and go like that and there we go now we

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
have that box and i'm just going to

114
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
stamp that in there and try to follow

115
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,519
along the lines of the subject here

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,120
although it's not going to be exactly

117
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,480
precise

118
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
what you're going for is a close

119
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,519
representation it's not going to be

120
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
exact but if you just follow along um in

121
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
a rudimentary way it should look good

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
once you're finished and zoomed out

123
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,879
okay so let me put these over here

124
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
and again to stamp these copies i'm just

125
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
pressing the spacebar

126
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
on my keyboard to do that

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,239
now if you notice here it's hard to see

128
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,599
what's actually going on so what i would

129
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,519
recommend doing is clicking on the image

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
and reducing the opacity of it i'm going

131
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
to open up the fill and stroke menu

132
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,918
which is located over here

133
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
and over here where it says opacity i'm

134
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,960
going to bring that down

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,720
and i would even recommend making the

136
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
page darker than white so that you can

137
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,080
see the white boxes when we start

138
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
creating them so i'm going to come back

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
to the document properties tab and come

140
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,479
over here to the display tab and where

141
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
it says page i'm going to click on that

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
and i'm going to make that a darker

143
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
shade i'm going to make that maybe

144
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
something like gray so we can see a

145
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
little better

146
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
okay so let me zoom back in here

147
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
let me uh create some more boxes

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
to fill in my subject here

149
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,919
i'm going to create the ear right here

150
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
and use this color so let me bring the

151
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
opacity of this image back up so i can

152
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
sample a better so i can sample that

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,639
color properly properly back to the fill

154
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
and stroke menu with the image selected

155
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,240
bring the opacity all the way up there

156
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
we go

157
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,880
and let me create a duplicate of this

158
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
box right here to move the page around

159
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
i'm just pressing down the mouse wheel

160
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
and moving the mouse let me take this

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
one duplicate that by pressing ctrl d

162
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
and i'll make this a darker shade let me

163
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
grab my dropper tool right here

164
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
make that a darker shade like that and i

165
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
may even change these boxes right here

166
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
to be the same color

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
just for consistency

168
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
okay that's a nice contrasting shade

169
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
compared to the other orange so i'm

170
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
going to leave that as it is

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
let me make copies in here again just

172
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,000
pressing the space bar to stamp copies

173
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
there we go

174
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,960
i'll put some copies up here

175
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
for this part of the ear

176
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
there we go

177
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
now i'm not what i'm doing right here is

178
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,320
i'm not filling in the entire subject

179
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
i'm just creating like an outline around

180
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
the main areas let me turn the opacity

181
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
of that image back down so i can see a

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
little better there we go we want to try

183
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
not to make duplicate copies of squares

184
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
in those grid lines if possible

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
there we go

186
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
let me just make an outline here going

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,120
around the outline of the shading

188
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,120
okay looking good

189
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,440
do this one as well

190
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
and don't worry about it being exactly

191
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
flush with the uh boundaries of the

192
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
subject it's not gonna be perfect but

193
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,919
that's okay it doesn't have to be

194
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
perfect so let me fill this in a little

195
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
more

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
okay now i'm gonna fill in the ear up

197
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
here using these colors again ctrl d to

198
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
duplicate and then just click and drag

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
and press down the space bar to stamp

200
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,680
copies of it as you see me doing here

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
okay so now i'm going to start filling

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
in the white area here and this is where

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,160
you'll see why it is that i change the

204
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,039
page border or the page color rather

205
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
because it makes it easier to see the

206
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
white i'm going to make that box white

207
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
and now you can see it much easier up

208
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,280
against that backdrop there you can see

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
exactly where the white boxes or pixels

210
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
as they're supposed to be are being

211
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639
placed

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
and a little shortcut for filling in

213
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
these large areas you don't have to

214
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
create individual boxes for each of

215
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
these areas you can just take one of

216
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
these transformation handles and bring

217
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
it down like that and as you can see it

218
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,520
just fills in the whole area nice and

219
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
easily without having to create too many

220
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
other copies in fact you could take

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
these existing copies right there and

222
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
just fill them in like that as you can

223
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
see there okay so if i if i zoom out a

224
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,479
little bit you can see this thing is

225
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,919
starting to come together you could

226
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,280
actually take the original image and

227
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
press delete to get rid of it just to

228
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
give you a temporary look at how it's

229
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,160
coming along now if you want to get your

230
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
image back just just do an undo which is

231
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
ctrl z

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ctrl z on the keyboard undoes your last

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,919
action so it puts it back there and now

234
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,160
i'm just gonna go and fill in this part

235
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,919
of the shading of the subject here using

236
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
these darker

237
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,360
boxes okay so now that that's filled in

238
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,680
i'm going to fill in this area over here

239
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
this part of the darker shading as well

240
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
okay so as you can see here it's

241
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
starting to come along nicely if i

242
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,240
delete this you can see it's starting to

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
come together a little bit still got a a

244
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
ways to go here i think what i'll do

245
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
next is i'll fill in this lighter area i

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
guess this reflection of light on the

247
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,640
fox's back right here

248
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
okay so next up i will fill in the tail

249
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
here these three different areas of the

250
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,880
tail and then i will fill in the larger

251
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
part of the body and then we will be

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,470
finished

253
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,669
[Music]

254
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
okay so i'm pretty much finished here i

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
just have to fill in this large area

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
right here which i could fill in by

257
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
creating individual boxes but it would

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,399
be pretty tedious so what i'm going to

259
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
do is i'm going to take a little bit of

260
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
a shortcut here and use the bezier pen

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
to just manually draw a shape and fill

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
it in with the color that would

263
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
otherwise be filled here so let me turn

264
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
off my snapping to do that i'm going to

265
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
grab the bezier pen and this is a trick

266
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
you may want to employ yourself

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
depending on the image you're working

268
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,519
with if it has large areas of a single

269
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,880
color like this

270
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
you may want to do something like this

271
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
yourself so let me grab the bezier pen

272
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,399
over here keyboard shortcut is b let me

273
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,680
zoom in on this

274
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
and i'm just going to draw a shape going

275
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
through the edges here that i'm going to

276
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,959
use to fill in the rest of this object

277
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
and then we will be finished

278
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,560
so let me just uh

279
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
come around the edges here like this

280
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
there we go

281
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
back to the starting point

282
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
and i will make this the same color

283
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
as the object that i'd like to the boxes

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
i would have filled in there otherwise

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
and i can get rid of that outline by

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
holding shift

287
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
and clicking on this little x down here

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,839
now i'm going to take this grab this

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
selection tool i'm going to send that to

290
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
the bottom using this button right here

291
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,040
lower selection to the bottom

292
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
and then i'm going to raise it one step

293
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,160
by uh clicking this button next to it

294
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,120
that says

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
or two buttons over to the left that

296
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
says raise selection one step and now it

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
should be over the original image now

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
let me zoom out a little bit

299
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
let me take the original image and move

300
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,079
it out of the way

301
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,600
as you can see here we're pretty much

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
finished we have our vector

303
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
pixel art that we created from the

304
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
vector fox here

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
now if i zoom out one more thing i

306
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,519
wanted to point out let's turn off the

307
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,720
page grid i'm going to come up here to

308
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
where it says view

309
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,839
where it says page grid i'm going to

310
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
deselect that

311
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,959
now if you notice

312
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,600
there's space showing through

313
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
these boxes in here

314
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
because of the way vector graphics work

315
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
in general this isn't just an

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
inkscape problem this happens in every

317
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
vector application you're going to

318
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
notice these little these little gaps

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
between the boxes here maybe it's not so

320
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
apparent on my screen if i were to make

321
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
this page background a little darker

322
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
you'd probably see it you can see more

323
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
of those

324
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
um lines showing through between the

325
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
boxes the way that we remedy this is

326
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
just by selecting everything and

327
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
duplicating it so let me select

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,839
everything here

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
i actually want to select everything

330
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
except for this large image in here or

331
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
this large object that i drew with the

332
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
bezier pen so to deselect just that part

333
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
i'm going to hold shift and click on

334
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
that to deselect it and now i should

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
just have the boxes selected and with

336
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
the boxes selected you can duplicate

337
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
them by pressing ctrl d on the keyboard

338
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
and there you go if you zoom out those

339
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,240
uh gaps should be gone if they're not

340
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
you could just duplicate it one more

341
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
time and that should do the trick

342
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
and there you go that is how

343
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
you can fix that problem

344
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
and i think that should do it for this

345
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
tutorial that is how you can go about

346
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
creating uh simple pixel art tracings

347
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,000
over vector graphics using inkscape if

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,519
you found this lesson useful then

349
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,600
consider checking out my inkscape master

350
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,839
class it's a collection of over 60

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
videos where i go over all of the tools

352
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
and features in inkscape and i explain

353
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
what they are and demonstrate how they

354
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
work kind of like how i did in this

355
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,120
video we even have a private community

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,959
where you can ask questions and get help

357
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,600
from me anytime you want and best of all

358
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
there's no monthly membership fees you

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,959
just pay 17

360
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
one time and you're in for life i'll

361
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
have some information about that down

362
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
below if you want to check that out as

363
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,040
