1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
in previous tutorials i've gone over a

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,000
method of duplicating objects around a

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
circle where an object is rotated and

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,080
stamped in multiple places

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,920
this is a really useful technique for

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,840
any inkscape user to know and i've had a

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
lot of people ask me how to do something

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,799
like this in the past

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,720
so i feel like this deserves a video of

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,250
its own

11
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,149
[Music]

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,840
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,880
you can stamp an

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
object around a circle using inkscape

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
but before we get started if you'd like

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
to learn more about inkscape be sure to

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
check out the inkscape master class it's

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
a collection of over 60 videos where i

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,040
go over

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,320
all of the tools and features in

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
inkscape and i explain what they are and

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
demonstrate how they work

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
i'll have a link in the description of

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,719
the video if you want to check that out

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
so to get us started here on inkscape

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,520
the first thing we want to do is just

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,039
set up the document so that we are all

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,320
working with a similar

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,879
layout up here where it says view make

31
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,120
sure you have custom selected

32
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,320
and then come up here to where it says

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
zoom and zoom in at one to one

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,600
and to get us started here as you can

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
see i have this example object

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
just for demonstrative purposes you

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
don't have to use this object you can

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,720
use whatever object you'd like if you

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
want to follow along you can use a

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
circle or a star or a letter or whatever

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,200
you'd like

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
so if you zoom in on this object over

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
here i'm just going to hold ctrl and

44
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
roll up the mouse wheel to zoom in

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,080
i have this object selected with the

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
select tool and by default it gives us

47
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,680
the scaling handles over here that

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
allows us to scale the image

49
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
but if you click on the object again

50
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
you'll get the rotation handles which

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
allows us to rotate the

52
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
image or the object around a center

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
point

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
and the center point is located right

55
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
here it may be difficult for you to see

56
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,479
on my screen but it's this little

57
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,759
crosshair right here

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,079
this represents the axis on which the

59
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,159
object rotates and you can actually move

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,520
that around if you take this and move

61
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
this over here to the side

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
you'll notice that now the object

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,079
rotates around

64
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
that that point right there now let me

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
undo that by pressing ctrl z

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,159
and you can take this center point and

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,680
move this anywhere you can move this all

68
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
the way out here if you want to

69
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
and now it'll rotate around that axis

70
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,479
okay so and if at any point if you want

71
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
to put the rotation center

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
back in the middle of the object all you

73
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
have to do is hold shift and click on it

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,640
and it'll place it right back in the

75
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
middle

76
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
so if you wanted to take this object and

77
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,360
duplicate it around a circle

78
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
we can take advantage of this feature

79
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
right here so let me zoom out a little

80
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
bit i'm going to hold ctrl and roll down

81
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,599
the mouse wheel

82
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
i'm going to take this little crosshair

83
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,239
and i'm going to bring this down here

84
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
but i'm going to hold ctrl so it locks

85
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
it onto the vertical axis

86
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
we want to come straight down like this

87
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
all the way down here

88
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
now what you can do is you can take this

89
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,519
rotation

90
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,519
handle on the corner here and rotate

91
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
this around in a circle

92
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,160
and to create duplicate copies of this

93
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,959
what you can do

94
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
is as you're rotating it you can press

95
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
the space bar

96
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
and every time you press the space bar

97
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,959
it'll stamp a copy of it

98
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
as you see happening on my screen now

99
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,720
let me go ahead and undo that

100
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
if you want to take this object and

101
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
rotate it in such a way that you create

102
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
a symmetrical shape

103
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,800
with each with each individual object

104
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,159
being equally spaced apart

105
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
what you can do is while you're rotating

106
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
hold the ctrl key and it will lock the

107
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
rotation onto 15 degree increments

108
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
so you can start here go there

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,480
there and as you see i am creating a

110
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
symmetrical shape

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
where this object is being stamped

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
around a circle

113
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
okay so let's say you want to take this

114
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,159
shape and wrap it around

115
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,480
a circle that has a predetermined size

116
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
so let me move this out of the way

117
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
let's create a circle here the circles

118
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,519
and ellipses tool i'm going to click and

119
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
drag hold ctrl to create a perfectly

120
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,159
round circle

121
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
let's say you have a circle like this

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,519
and let's say

123
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,120
it's sized at let me just change the

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
size to 200 pixels let's say you want to

125
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
wrap this around a 200 pixel circle

126
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
what you can do is you can take this

127
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
object here let me get rid of these

128
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
objects

129
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
you can take this object here select it

130
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
hold shift click on this object here the

131
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,239
circle

132
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,239
and let's open up the alignment menu

133
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,280
over here where it says align and

134
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
distribute objects

135
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,040
and i want to make sure i have last

136
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
selected chosen from this drop down

137
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
and where i want to align it is right

138
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
here where it says

139
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
align bottom edges of objects to the top

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
edge of the anchor so it's going to

141
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
stack it right on top of the circle

142
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
and then i want to center it up on the

143
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
vertical axis so it's going to put it in

144
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
the center

145
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,639
of this object and it's going to put it

146
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,720
on the top of this object like this

147
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
now let me click off of it to deselect

148
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
everything let me zoom in a little bit

149
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
so what i want to do is i want to take

150
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
this object and wrap it around this

151
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,960
circle

152
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
so what i want to do is take the center

153
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
point or that cross hair for this object

154
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
and place it in the center

155
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
of the circle and the way to do that to

156
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,600
make sure that it's exactly in the

157
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
center of the circle what you could do

158
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
is you could turn on snapping up here

159
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
where it says enable snapping turn that

160
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
on if it's not on already

161
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
and over here what we're looking for

162
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
snap centers of objects click on that

163
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
snap and items rotation center we want

164
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
to click on that we want to make sure

165
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,919
this is the important one right here

166
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
snap and items rotation center

167
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
this will make it so that when you grab

168
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
that little crosshair it will snap it

169
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
into the center of the object you place

170
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,960
it over

171
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
so let me click on this again to get

172
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
back to the rotation handles and there's

173
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
the center point

174
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
as it already is let me just shift-click

175
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
that to put that back in the center

176
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
as if we were starting fresh now i'm

177
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,680
going to take this crosshair and i'm

178
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
going to snap it into the center of the

179
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,680
circle

180
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
and if you notice it automatically snaps

181
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
it right into the center there

182
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
and what you can do now is you can

183
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
rotate this around you can hold ctrl

184
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
and go through and stamp this

185
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,280
and again at each position you just

186
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
press the spacebar and it's stamping it

187
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
