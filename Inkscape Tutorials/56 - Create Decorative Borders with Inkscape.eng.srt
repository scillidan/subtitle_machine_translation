00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,320
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
you can create this decorative border

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,040
design

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,359
using inkscape before we get started

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,480
though if you'd like to learn

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
everything that there is to know about

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,359
inkscape be sure to check out my

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,960
inkscape master class

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
it's a collection of over 60 videos

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,560
where i go over every tool and feature

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,359
in inkscape

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
and i explain what it is and demonstrate

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,119
how it works i'll have a link to that in

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
the description of the video if you want

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
to check that out

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
so to get us started here in inkscape

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
the first thing we have to do is set up

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
our documents let's come over here to

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,440
file

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,239
and click on document properties and for

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,440
this tutorial i want to make sure the

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,239
display units is set to pixels or px

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,120
and i just want to turn off the

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
visibility of the page border right here

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
where it says show page border and then

28
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
close out of that

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
and then we want to come up here to

30
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
where it says view make sure you have

31
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
custom selected

32
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
and then go to zoom and we'll zoom in at

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
one to one

34
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,280
and then we'll open up the fill and

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
stroke menu which is located right here

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,000
or you could press

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
ctrl shift and f on the keyboard to open

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
that and then we'll open up the align

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
and distribute menu which is right here

40
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,479
or you can press ctrl

41
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
shift and a to open that and they should

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
be open right here

43
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
and if you notice they opened in these

44
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
separate menus over here so what i'm

45
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
going to do is i'm going to take this

46
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
top menu and just click and drag this

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,479
like this until we get the blue

48
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,840
activation box

49
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
so i can dock that up top and i have

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,520
this one open so we have them both open

51
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,000
at the same

52
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
time like that and then finally we want

53
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
to come up here to where it says enable

54
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
snapping make sure you have that turned

55
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,320
on

56
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
and the settings we want turned on for

57
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
this tutorial are this one right here

58
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
that says snap nodes pads and handles

59
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,240
the next one that says snap to paths

60
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
we're going to want to snap

61
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
to cusp nodes and then snap to smooth

62
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,119
nodes as well

63
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,479
okay so the first thing we're going to

64
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
do is uh we're going to create a square

65
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,759
because the way we're going to approach

66
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
this border design is that we're going

67
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,479
to design the corners of it first

68
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
because the corners are pretty

69
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,719
complicated as well

70
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
as as soon as we create one corner we

71
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
should be able to duplicate it and

72
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
mirror it and use it as a border that

73
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,320
way so

74
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
let's grab the squares and rectangles

75
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
tool over here

76
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
and i'm just going to click and drag on

77
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,878
the canvas i'm going to hold ctrl and

78
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
shift to create a perfectly symmetrical

79
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
square like that

80
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,760
i want to make sure that is black i want

81
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
to make sure it has sharp corners come

82
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
up here

83
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
to where it says this this icon right

84
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
here that says make karn make

85
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
corner sharp if it's grayed out and you

86
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
can't click on it that means you already

87
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
have sharp corners like i have here if

88
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
you use if yours has rounded corners

89
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
just go ahead and click on that to

90
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
make those make those corners sharp now

91
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
what i'm going to do is grab the select

92
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,360
tool

93
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
and i want to change the size of this to

94
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
50 pixels by 50 pixels so

95
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
i'm going to come up here between the w

96
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
and the h which is the width and the

97
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,120
height

98
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
i'm going to turn on this lock icon

99
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
right here that says when locked change

100
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
both the width and the height by the

101
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
same proportions

102
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
and i want to change the width of this

103
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
to 50. so i'll hit 5.0 and press enter

104
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
and i want to take the opacity of this

105
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
and bring this down roughly in half

106
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
now what i want to do is duplicate this

107
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,080
so let's right click that and go to

108
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,120
duplicate

109
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
let's make this duplicate copy red and

110
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,480
let's add

111
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
50 pixels to each dimension of this one

112
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
so 50 plus 50 would be 100 so let's

113
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
remove that 1 0 0 and press enter

114
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
and now i want to lower that beneath the

115
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,519
original square so i'm going to come up

116
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,640
here to where it says

117
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
lower selection one step or what i like

118
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
to do is just press page down

119
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
on the keyboard and it'll lower it

120
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
beneath the black square

121
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
and then i want to click and drag over

122
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
both of those and just center them up

123
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
on the vertical and horizontal axis like

124
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,760
that

125
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,120
and as i mentioned previously you got to

126
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
make sure you have last selected chosen

127
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,400
from this drop down otherwise

128
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
you may end up with a different result

129
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
here okay so once we've done that

130
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
let's click off of that to deselect

131
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,920
everything let's create another copy of

132
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
this square here so let's click on the

133
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,239
red square

134
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
let's duplicate that instead of right

135
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
clicking it and going to duplicate

136
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
we'll just press ctrl d on the keyboard

137
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
and i'll make that copy black and i will

138
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
add another 50 pixels to this one so

139
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
this one would be

140
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
150 like that and then i will lower that

141
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
to the bottom

142
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
with this button up here that says lower

143
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
selection to the bottom or we could

144
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,040
press the end

145
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
key on your keyboard let's press end

146
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
there we go

147
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,159
and then i'll center this up as well

148
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,439
click and drag over all of that to

149
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,159
select it

150
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,760
center it up vertically and horizontally

151
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
like that

152
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
click off of it to deselect everything

153
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
and now what i want to do is create a

154
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
rectangle coming down here like an arm

155
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
coming extending down from the square so

156
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
i'm going to zoom in on this a little

157
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
bit so i can see it better to zoom in

158
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
i'm just going to hold ctrl and roll up

159
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
the mouse wheel a few times to move the

160
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
page around like this just press down

161
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,960
the mouse wheel and move the mouse

162
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
and let's grab the rectangles and

163
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
squares tool let's snap to this top left

164
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
corner

165
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
click and drag and then snap to this

166
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,639
bottom corner over here like that

167
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
and then we'll convert that to a path by

168
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
going to path object to path

169
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
and then let's take the select tool

170
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
let's take this bottom arrow right here

171
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,960
and just bring this down

172
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
like that we want to bring that down let

173
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
me zoom out i'm going to press 1 on the

174
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
keyboard to zoom back out to 100

175
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
and once we've done that let's create a

176
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
duplicate of that by pressing ctrl

177
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
d and let's hold shift and click on this

178
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,440
little

179
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
square right here in the mental in the

180
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,639
middle and center this up

181
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
according to the actually no instead of

182
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
centering it we're going to align the

183
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
left edges so click on the button that

184
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
says align left edges click off of it to

185
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
deselect everything

186
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
and let's create another copy for up

187
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
here up top so let's take this copy

188
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
right here

189
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
ctrl d to duplicate it rotate this 90

190
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,720
degrees like that

191
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
with this button right here that says

192
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
rotate selection 90 degrees clockwise

193
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
and then hold shift click on the large

194
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
black square in the background there

195
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,880
we're going to align top edges and

196
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
align left edges like that now click off

197
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,160
of it to

198
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
deselect take a copy of this right here

199
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
click on that

200
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,479
control d hold shift click on the

201
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
smaller black square in the middle there

202
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
and let's align the top edges again so

203
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
that we end up with this right here now

204
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,919
we can click off of this to deselect

205
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
everything

206
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,479
so what i'm going to do next is i'm

207
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
going to take this large black square

208
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,199
right here i'm going to duplicate that

209
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,720
by pressing ctrl d

210
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
i want to make this one red and again we

211
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
are going to add 50 to 50 pixels to each

212
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
dimension so let's come up here and

213
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,039
change this from 150

214
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,319
to 200 and i want to make sure i have

215
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
this centered up above the other the

216
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
other squares here so let me move this

217
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
off to the side i'm going to hold shift

218
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,039
click on one of these squares and then

219
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,639
just center it up on the vertical and

220
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,479
horizontal axis like that

221
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
click off of it to deselect everything

222
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
and now what you want to do is take this

223
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
red square right here

224
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,639
duplicate it by pressing ctrl d hold

225
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
shift click on this rectangle right here

226
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
and go to path difference

227
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,919
and then we'll do the same thing over

228
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,840
here for this one take this red square

229
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,880
only this time we're not going to

230
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,319
duplicate it we're going to take that as

231
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,120
it is

232
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
hold shift click on this rectangle right

233
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
here path

234
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
difference and now what we want to do is

235
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,560
duplicate

236
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,840
this object by pressing ctrl d

237
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,759
and then just bring this one down here

238
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
like that now we'll take this

239
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,599
little leg right here ctrl d to

240
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,520
duplicate it bring this one up here like

241
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
that

242
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
and now i want to make it so that these

243
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,479
two i want to clip off the

244
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
little the two little tails that are

245
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,639
extending beyond the uh

246
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,400
border there so to do that let me zoom

247
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,759
in i'm going to hold ctrl roll up the

248
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,720
mouse wheel

249
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,639
grab the edit pads by nodes tool which

250
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
is the second tool down from the top up

251
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
here

252
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
click and drag over these two nodes and

253
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
then hold ctrl and just click and drag

254
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
them both straight up like that until

255
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,759
they snap onto the edge of that

256
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,120
rectangle we'll do the same thing over

257
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
here take this click and drag over those

258
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,479
two

259
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
hold ctrl click and drag until it snaps

260
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
over there like that

261
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,919
and now we can zoom back out let's go to

262
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,440
the select tool

263
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
let's click and drag over everything so

264
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
we have it all selected

265
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and now we just want to deselect this

266
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
black square and deselect this red

267
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
square so to do that i'm going to hold

268
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,120
shift

269
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
click on that black square to deselect

270
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
it hold shift again

271
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
click on this red square to deselect

272
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
that and now what we have selected we

273
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,319
just want to unify it

274
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
so to do that go to path union

275
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
and now i want to hold shift click on

276
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,680
this red square

277
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
go to path difference

278
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
now if we press one on the keyboard to

279
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
zoom back out to 100

280
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,479
we can click and drag over everything

281
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,039
here bring the opacity all the way up

282
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
and you could even unify together by

283
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
going to path union

284
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
and now we have a corner to use of this

285
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
decorative border so let's go ahead and

286
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
create an actual border around something

287
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,680
using this so

288
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
i'm just going to scale this down a

289
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
little bit i'm going to hold ctrl and

290
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
shift and scale this down

291
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
i'm going to create like a little

292
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
rectangle on the canvas here so i'm

293
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
going to grab the rectangle tool

294
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
click and drag to create a rectangle

295
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
like this

296
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,958
maybe i will make this a different color

297
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,240
like something like a light green

298
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,679
and i want to use this object right here

299
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
as a border around this red rectangle so

300
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
let me grab the select tool

301
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
let me take this corner let me bring

302
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,120
this over here it's layered beneath

303
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
the uh the green rectangle so i'm just

304
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
going to come over here to where it says

305
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
raise selection to the top

306
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
and i want to place this in the corner

307
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
up here like that okay now i want to

308
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
duplicate this

309
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
ctrl d to duplicate it bring this down

310
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
here let's flip this

311
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
vertically like that put this over here

312
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,839
like that snap that into this

313
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,480
and let's take both of those right there

314
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
right click

315
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
duplicate now let's flip these

316
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,399
horizontally

317
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
and bring these over here like this

318
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,839
okay now in order to close these in all

319
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,440
we have to do now is let's click off of

320
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,959
that to deselect everything

321
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
let's grab the edit paths by nodes tool

322
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
let's click on this border right here

323
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
and i'm going to take these nodes over

324
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:27,920
here

325
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
i'll probably i should probably zoom in

326
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
on this so you can see it better

327
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
click and drag over these nodes right

328
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
here and then just bring them over

329
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
to this object right here like that

330
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
we'll do the same thing over here take

331
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
these nodes bring them straight up like

332
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,720
that

333
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
hold ctrl so it locks onto the vertical

334
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
axis you can either snap it on there

335
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,839
like that

336
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
or you could just hold ctrl and bring

337
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,600
them into so that it protrudes into the

338
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,000
other one

339
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
like that and i prefer doing it that way

340
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
because if you don't if you snap them

341
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,279
like that you'll notice if you zoom out

342
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,800
there's a little bit of a disconnect

343
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
between the two probably difficult to

344
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
see it on my screen but

345
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
i can see it pretty well okay so let me

346
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
fix that

347
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
bring that up further and i'll do the

348
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
same thing right here i'll take this

349
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
bring this in over here hold ctrl bring

350
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
that to that side

351
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,079
and then the same thing right here take

352
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,720
that bring that to that side like that

353
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
and there you go okay and using that

354
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
method

355
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
you can use that method to apply this

356
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,959
border to

357
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,680
any rectangle you'd like so i think that

358
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
should do it for this tutorial that is

359
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
how you can go about creating this

360
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
simple

361
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
decorative style border using inkscape

362
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
if you have any questions leave a

363
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,360
