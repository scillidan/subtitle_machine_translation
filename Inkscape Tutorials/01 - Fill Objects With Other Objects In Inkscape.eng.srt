1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating a

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,679
simple technique for taking a single

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,480
object and filling it with another

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,320
object using inkscape before we get

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,519
started though if you want to learn more

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,960
about how inkscape Works be sure to

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,080
check out my inkscape master class it's

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,879
a collection of over 80 videos where we

9
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,520
go over all of the tools and features in

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,640
inkscape and I explain what they are and

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
demonstrate how they work kind of like

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,680
how I'll do in this video we even have a

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,119
private Community where you can ask

14
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,680
questions and get help from me anytime

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
you need it I'll have some information

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,480
about that down below if you want to

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
check that out and now that that out of

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,520
the way let's get started so I'm going

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,879
to open up a blank document and I'm

20
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,280
going to grab my text tool by either

21
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,680
grabbing it from the toolbar over here

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,920
or just pressing the letter t on the

23
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,520
keyboard and I'm going to click on the

24
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,079
canvas and for this demonstration I'm

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,360
just going to use the letter s I'm going

26
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,079
to use a large capital letter s I'm

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,719
going to hold control and scale this up

28
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,760
so that we maintain the aspect ratio and

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,320
let me open up my text editor by going

30
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,079
to text and selecting text and font and

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm going to change the font of this to

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,920
monserat Black and I'm going to use a

33
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,399
very heavyweight front for this because

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,280
it gives us more space to fill in with

35
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,479
that object let me scale this up some

36
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,000
more I'm going to convert this to a path

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,799
by going to path object to path and then

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,759
I will quote unquote ungroup it by going

39
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,000
to object ungroup now nothing visibly

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
changes there but it just it's a

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
function that's required to make this

42
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,000
work as needed and now I'm going to open

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
up the layers menu by going to layer and

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
selecting layers and objects and if you

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,680
notice here this text next object is

46
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,000
located on layer one I'm going to create

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,680
a new layer on top of this where I'm

48
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,119
going to place the object that I would

49
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,439
like to fill this in with so I'm going

50
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,920
to click this plus icon up here and it's

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,680
going to add a new layer and I have an

52
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,759
object already copied to my clipboard

53
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,439
I'm just going to press control V to

54
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,280
paste that in there you can use any

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,000
object you want to fill in your shape or

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,520
letter you can use a single object or as

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,159
in my case I'm using a grouping of

58
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,399
objects here so I have this orange slice

59
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,600
that I created I'm just going to fill it

60
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,680
in with this let me scale this down a

61
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,360
little bit and I want to Center this I

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,079
want to put this in the top left corner

63
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,000
of this object but first let me take

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,679
this object and make note of the size if

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
I come up here to the the settings where

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
it says W and H for width and height you

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
can see the size I'm going to size this

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
at 500 pixels wide and then it's going

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,440
to go to about 580 pixels high so I'm

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,680
going to make a mental note of this

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,640
width and height for my instance here

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,599
I'm going to use 500 by 600 I'm just

73
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,480
going to round up to make it easier I'm

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
going to click on this object hold shift

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,480
click on this object and I want to align

76
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
those two together so let me come up

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
here to object and go to align and

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,760
distribute and let me choose last

79
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,120
selected and I'm going to align the left

80
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,360
edges and the top edges so that it

81
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,040
places the object in the top left corner

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,599
of this object's bounding box and now I

83
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,159
can click off of it to select every to

84
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,400
deselect everything so let me just come

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
over here to my layers menu and make

86
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,319
sure I have everything as I need it this

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,879
object here is in Layer Two and this

88
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,480
this object is layer one everything

89
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,560
looks good there now I'm going to use

90
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,959
the tiled clones feature to generate

91
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,560
copies of this image inside or this

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
graphic inside of this letter so to do

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,599
that I'm going to go to edit clone and

94
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,319
choose create tiled clones and the

95
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,280
settings I'm going to use for this I'm

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,400
first going to come over here to scale

97
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,640
and I want to make sure I have the

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,000
randomized column set to 50% for both

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
the X and the Y AIS make sure you have

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,840
zeros in here it should be by default

101
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,200
but if not just make sure to enter zeros

102
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,120
and then I'll come over here to the

103
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,959
rotation we want to rotate this object

104
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,280
as well we don't want it to just be the

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,239
same rotation all the way through we

106
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,319
want randomized rotation so I set the

107
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,000
randomize to 100% I'm going to leave

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
these two at zero and bluring opacity

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,879
I'll leave that empty color I'll leave

110
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,400
that empty and I'll come over here to

111
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
trace you want to enable this option

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,000
right here that says trace the drawing

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,319
under the Clone SL spray items and we're

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,519
going to choose the opacity setting and

115
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,319
then only the presence setting make sure

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,720
you deselect these other settings here

117
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,079
and now when we choose between rows and

118
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,439
columns or width and height we're going

119
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,159
to choose width and height and we're

120
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
going to enter that width and height of

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,879
this object that you made note of

122
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,519
earlier so for my example here I was

123
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,040
doing this earlier so these numbers are

124
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
already there it's 500 by 600 so now

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,040
with that in place I'm going to click

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,680
the create button and it should generate

127
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,800
copies of that object within the other

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,160
object now if you notice the copies are

129
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
kind of large I didn't really like how

130
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
that came out so I'm going to press

131
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,840
press command Z or control Z to undo

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,479
that and I'm going to make this object a

133
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,960
little smaller and try that again I'm

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
going to make that a little bit smaller

135
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,440
let me Zoom back out and click the

136
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,720
create button again and see how that

137
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
goes okay that looks a little better but

138
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,759
still a little large let me undo that

139
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,120
again and I'll make this a little bit

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
smaller and this should do the trick

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,560
this time let me try it one more

142
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,960
time okay that looks a lot better so now

143
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
that that's in place let me zoom in on

144
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
this a little bit let me close out of

145
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,320
the tille Clones menu we don't need that

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,520
anymore if you notice the objects are

147
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,039
overlapping each other which doesn't

148
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,680
really create a good effect we want them

149
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
to be not overlapping so to correct that

150
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,199
I'm going to hold control and shift and

151
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,880
take this original object and scale it

152
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,560
down a little bit and if you notice when

153
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
I do that all of the other objects scale

154
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
down as well because these are all

155
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
linked clones so whatever I do to this

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,160
original object it will also happen to

157
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,520
these other objects so scaling it up and

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,880
down will help increase and decrease the

159
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,199
density of the objects within the shape

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
and that right there looks like a good

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,199
happy medium I'm going to move this out

162
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,160
of the way if you notice we have some

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
imperfections in here a lot of these

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,280
objects went outside of the shape that's

165
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
okay we could just go through and click

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
on them and press delete one by one to

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
get rid of them so I'm just going to go

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,120
through here and delete these real

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
quick and another thing you'll probably

170
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,639
want to do let me just get rid of that

171
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,720
one as well another thing you'll want to

172
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,240
do is go and move these around a little

173
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,000
bit just to correct the spacing and we

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
we're just going to do this manually

175
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,919
we're going to go through these one by

176
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,120
one let me come up here to the top of

177
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,919
the layers menu I'm going to collapse

178
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,800
layer two so I can see layer one and I

179
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,520
want to lock layer one so that I don't

180
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,960
accidentally move the layer or the

181
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,599
object in the layer with what I'm about

182
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,960
to do because what what I'm going to do

183
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
now is I'm just going to manually move

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,440
these objects around so that they are

185
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,680
sitting on the edge of the shape or the

186
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,960
letter and you may have to just manually

187
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,680
adjust these so that they

188
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,520
are uh evenly spaced out and they don't

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
overlap each other or they don't look

190
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,199
like they're big gaps between them so

191
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm just going to balance these out a

192
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
little bit and again this is something

193
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,240
we're going to do manually you can hold

194
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,280
control and scale it up and down and if

195
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
you want to make additional copies you

196
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
could just click and drag it and then

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
press the space bar and it'll make

198
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,000
copies of it so you can just make copies

199
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,280
in there like that by pressing your

200
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,720
space bar and I'll move these around a

201
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
little bit as well and I think you get

202
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
the idea so let me just go through here

203
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,880
real quick and just straighten this out

204
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,680
so that it looks good and then I will

205
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,520
catch up with you when I'm finished

206
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,080
all right so for the most part I

207
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,599
finished up here there's a few loose

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,160
ends that need to be tied up this one

209
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,639
looks a little big and there's some

210
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,960
empty gaps in there but you should get

211
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,039
the idea by now the really important

212
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,440
thing when doing this is to make sure

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
that you have these objects as close to

214
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,319
the edge of the larger object as

215
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,400
possible because that's what's really

216
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,680
going to help it maintain its appearance

217
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,720
as the original shape if they get too

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
far from The Edge it's going to kind of

219
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
lose its appearance so that's really

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
important and once you're done doing all

221
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
of this these objects should still be

222
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
linked together so you can still

223
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,240
increase or decrease the size of these

224
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
clones if you want to using the original

225
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
but I think it looks good as it was so

226
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
I'll just put that back and now that

227
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
that's done let me come back up here to

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
my top the top of my layers menu I'm

229
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,560
going to collapse Layer Two where all

230
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
those all of those clones are and I'll

231
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
come over here to layer one and I'm just

232
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,599
going to turn off the visibility of it

233
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,440
and you can see the effect now I've

234
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
taken this object and filled in the

235
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,919
other object with copies of it and maybe

236
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,039
I'll even make this a little

237
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
bigger yeah that looks pretty good I

238
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,599
like how that looks right there and yeah

239
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,479
I think that should do it for this

240
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,960
tutorial so that's how you can use the

241
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,240
tiled clones feature in inkscape to fill

242
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
in an object with another object if you

243
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,000
have any questions just leave a comment

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
below and as always thanks for watching

245
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,159
if you found this lesson useful then

246
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,240
consider checking out my inkscape master

247
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,440
class it's a collection of over 60

248
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,080
videos where I go over all of the tools

249
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,159
and features in inkscape and I explain

250
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,680
what they are and demonstrate how they

251
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
work kind of like how I did in this

252
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
video we even have a private Community

253
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,560
where you can ask questions and get help

254
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,200
for me anytime you want and best of all

255
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
there's no monthly membership fees you

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
just pay $17 one time and you're in for

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,839
Life I'll have some information about

258
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,958
that down below if you want to check

259
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,719
