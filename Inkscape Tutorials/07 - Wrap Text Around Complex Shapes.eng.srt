1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
in previous tutorials I demonstrated how

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,080
you can wrap text around simple shapes

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,040
like a circle by using the place on text

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,879
command however in this tutorial I'm

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,400
going to show you how you can wrap text

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,599
around more complicated shapes such as a

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,480
heart and to show you what I mean if I

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,000
were to select both of these objects

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,600
here and go to text and select put on

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,720
path you can see we don't get a very

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
good outcome we don't get to choose the

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,519
placement of the text on the path it

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,000
just randomly chooses it and you can't

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
choose a different start or end point

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,279
for this text so to get this result what

16
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,640
we're going to do is we're going to

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,600
create separate paths for each half of

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
the heart and then create separate lines

19
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,200
of text for each path so let me get

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,440
started on that I'm going to grab my

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,920
selection tool and instead of placing

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,120
the text directly on this path I'm going

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
to place it on a copy of the path so I'm

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
going to create a linked offset I'm

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
actually going to create an offset copy

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
of the shape so I could place the text

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
around the outside padding of the shape

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,199
instead of placing it directly on top of

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,120
the shape so let me select this object I

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,159
will go to path and I will select linked

31
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,400
offset and then I will go to my nodes

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,960
tool and I will pull this node out to

33
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,240
create a little bit of an offset and I

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,600
will give this a different color just so

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,560
I could differentiate it from the

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,119
original shape and I'll pull this out to

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,159
about

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
there and now I'm going to convert this

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,280
to a path by going to path object to

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,479
path and I want to apply a stroke to

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,400
this so let me grab my selection tool

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm going to hold the shift key and I'm

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,320
going to click the letter or the color

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,400
blue just to apply a blue stroke and

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,720
then I'm going to remove remove the fill

46
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,799
color now let me make that stroke a

47
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,079
little smaller I'm going to open up my

48
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,759
fill and stroke menu by double clicking

49
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,520
this stripe down here I'll go to the

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,920
stroke style Tab and I'm just going to

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,640
make that

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,759
one so the approach I'm going to use

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,520
here is I'm going to break this up into

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
separate pads and then Place separate

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
lines on each path so let me select this

56
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,040
object and I'm going to go to my nodes

57
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,159
tool and I want to select this node

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
right here and I want to break the path

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,079
at that node so I'll come up here to

60
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,880
this icon that says break path at

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,680
selected nodes when you your cursor over

62
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,880
and I'll click on that and nothing Vis

63
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,600
visibly changes on your screen but the

64
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,079
path has now been broken up into

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,318
separate nodes as you can see there and

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,479
I'll come down here and do the same

67
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,919
thing I Want to Break these paths up as

68
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,560
well so let me select those and I'm

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
going to break those paths as well and

70
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
now I'm going to break apart the entire

71
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
shape so let me go back to my select

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,720
tool I will go to path and select break

73
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,599
apart and now I can just take this

74
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,000
little piece down here and get rid of

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
this and if you can see now we have

76
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
separate paths for each half of the

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,000
shape and what I'm going to do is create

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,360
separate lines of text one line of text

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
going on this side and another line

80
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,879
going on this side so I have one line of

81
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,239
text right now I want to break this up

82
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,360
into two so let me duplicate this by

83
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,400
pressing contrl D or command D if you're

84
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,920
on Mac and the way that I set this up is

85
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,800
I had up until the word four going over

86
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,879
here and then after that the right side

87
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,599
begins so I'm going to end the line of

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,080
text after the word four I'm going to

89
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,680
grab my text

90
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,840
tool so now that I have my two SE

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,159
separate lines of text I'm going to take

92
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,239
this line of text hold shift click on

93
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,360
this left path and then go to text and

94
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,799
select put on

95
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,159
path now we end up with this effect here

96
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,560
which is not what I'm going for so I'm

97
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,879
going to click off of that to deselect

98
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,920
it I'm going to select just the path and

99
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,000
now to place the text on the outside of

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
the path rather than the inside I'm

101
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
going to reverse the direction of the

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
path so I will go to path and select if

103
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,120
I can find it reverse there it is and

104
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,440
now it's going to put it on the outside

105
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,200
so the problem I have now is I have to

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
make this text a little bigger to fill

107
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,599
in the rest of this empty space here so

108
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,519
let me grab my text tool and I'm going

109
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,560
to Triple click this text to select it

110
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,799
and I'm going to make the size of this a

111
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,159
little bigger I'm going to try something

112
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,120
like 30 you see how that looks I'll

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
increase that maybe

114
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,920
34 okay 34 looks good whatever size you

115
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,879
use make a mental note what size that is

116
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,000
because we're going to use that same

117
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,200
size for this text object here so that

118
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
these two lines of text look

119
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,360
consistent so now that's done and I'll

120
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,439
come over here and do the same thing

121
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
I'll select this text object hold shift

122
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,000
click on the path and go to text and

123
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
select put on

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,760
path now I'm going to have to do the

125
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
same thing here with the reversing of

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,799
the pads I'm going to select the path

127
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,040
just the path and go to path and select

128
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
reverse and then I'll do the same thing

129
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,478
over here I'm going to grab my text tool

130
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,959
select all the text and I want to make

131
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,839
this the same size I'll make this

132
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,199
34 and I'm going to change the spacing

133
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,919
of this a little bit I mentioned earlier

134
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,000
that you can't really change the

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,080
position of the text on the path you can

136
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,720
a little bit by adding spacing between

137
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,919
the letters so I'm going to place the

138
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,720
cursor before the text and just press my

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
space bar to add some space in there and

140
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
if you want to add some more space

141
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
between individual letters just move

142
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,560
your cursor around with the arrows if

143
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,280
you place the cursor between two letters

144
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
you can hold the ALT key and use your

145
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,400
left and right arrows to increase and

146
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,880
decrease the spacing between the text or

147
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
if you're using Mac like me you can use

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
the option case so I'm holding option

149
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,919
and then using my right arrow key to

150
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,199
increase spacing between the letters and

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,479
the left Arrow key to decrease it

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
and once you're finished you can grab

153
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
your selection tool if you don't want

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
this ugly path sitting in your way you

155
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
can select the path and then turn off

156
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,759
well make sure you have it selected

157
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,960
because it's going to select the text

158
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,800
first I'm going to hold the ALT key or

159
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
the option key and click again so that

160
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,960
it grabs the path rather than the text

161
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
itself and you'll know you have the path

162
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
selected when you see the colored stripe

163
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,319
down there and I'm going to turn off the

164
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,199
visibility of that path by holding shift

165
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,520
and clicking the X and now it's gone and

166
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
I'll do the same thing over here to this

167
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
path I will select it

168
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
hold shift click the X to turn off the

169
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
visibility and now the path is no longer

170
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
visible it's still there it's just not

171
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
visible if you want to see it at any

172
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
point you can just come up here to where

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,479
it says view go to display mode and

174
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,199
choose outline overview and you can see

175
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,160
where that path is just make sure to go

176
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,479
back to the normal View mode once you're

177
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,039
done so let me go to view display mode

178
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,600
and choose normal and there we go if you

179
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
found this lesson useful then consider

180
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,840
checking out my inkscape master class

181
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
it's a collection of over 60 videos

182
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,080
where I go over all of the the tools and

183
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,120
features in inkscape and I explain what

184
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
they are and demonstrate how they work

185
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,199
kind of like how I did in this video we

186
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,840
even have a private Community where you

187
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,039
can ask questions and get help from me

188
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,280
anytime you want and best of all there's

189
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,319
no monthly membership fees you just pay

190
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,639
$17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

191
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,960
have some information about that down

192
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,639
below if you want to check that out as

193
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,520
