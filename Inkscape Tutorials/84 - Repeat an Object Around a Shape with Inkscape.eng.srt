00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,690
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,920
in today's tutorial I'll be

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,510
demonstrating how you can use the

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,390
pattern along path function in Inkscape

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,130
to create some unique and interesting

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,619
designs and patterns and if you'd like

8
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,090
to learn more about how Inkscape works

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,010
be sure to check out the Inkscape master

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,200
class which is a collection of over 60

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,580
videos that I created where I go over

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,020
all of the different tools and features

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,030
in Inkscape and I explain what they are

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,770
and demonstrate how they work we even

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,210
have a private community where I could

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,590
personally help you out and answer any

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,329
questions you have I'll put a link in

18
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,469
the description of the video if you want

19
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,510
to check that out so we're going to get

20
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,129
started here in Inkscape the first thing

21
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,359
we want to do is just make sure we're

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,460
all working with a similar page setup so

23
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,289
I'm going to go to view make sure you

24
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,659
have custom selected and then we're go

25
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,649
to view zoom and zoom in at 1 to 1 and

26
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,449
then I want to open up the align and

27
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,280
distribute menu with this button up here

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,379
we're gonna want last selected chosen

29
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,120
from this drop-down and then I'm going

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,710
to open up the Edit objects colors

31
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,540
gradients and Stroke menu with this

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,690
button over here so if you notice here I

33
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,090
have this shape selected and what I'm

34
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,380
gonna do is I'm gonna use the pattern

35
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,360
along path function in Inkscape to take

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,980
this stretch to take this shape and

37
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,890
stretch it out and repeat it around a

38
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,690
circle now you don't have to use this

39
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,070
shape you can use whatever shape you'd

40
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,630
like you could use a circle or a star

41
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,190
you can create some kind of custom shape

42
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,690
and shape if you'd like but what I'm

43
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,980
gonna do is I'm gonna grab the circles

44
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,810
and ellipses tool and I'm gonna hold

45
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,640
ctrl and shift and I'm gonna click and

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,200
drag in the campus to create a perfectly

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,810
round circle like that and this is the

48
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,790
path that I want to make this shape

49
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,070
follow along so I want to take copies of

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,830
this shape and make it repeat going all

51
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,290
along the edges of this circle right

52
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,780
here so what I'm gonna do first is I'm

53
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,490
just going to convert this to a path

54
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,530
I'll get a path object to path and

55
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,410
that's no longer a a circle or ellipse

56
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,780
object it's now recognized as a regular

57
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,670
path and what I'm going to do is I'm

58
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,790
going to open up the the path the path

59
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,130
effects menu by going to path and

60
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,400
clicking on path effects and what I'm

61
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,990
gonna do is I'm gonna click plus over

62
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,360
here to add a new path effect to this

63
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,700
circle and I'm gonna look for pattern

64
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,230
along path it should be about halfway

65
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,330
through the list here pattern along path

66
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,150
click Add

67
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,290
and what I want to do now is I want to

68
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,730
click on the shape that I'd like to

69
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,290
apply around the circle I'm gonna grab

70
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,060
the select tool I'm gonna click on my

71
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,530
shape right here like I said you can use

72
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,790
any shape you'd like you don't have to

73
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,709
use this here I'm gonna right click this

74
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,959
and go to copy and then I'm gonna click

75
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,450
on this circle and over here in the

76
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,610
pattern along path menu I'm gonna choose

77
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,170
where it says pattern copies i'm gonna

78
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,840
choose repeated stretched and i'm gonna

79
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,370
click on this button over here that says

80
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,950
link path on clipboard and if you notice

81
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,380
it took this object and repeated it

82
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,000
around the edge of that circle right

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,239
here and now this this circle here is

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,430
linked to this original shape so as i

85
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,280
add it this shape this will edit along

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,580
with it now let me zoom in let me zoom

87
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,340
in let me scale this down a little bit

88
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,470
let me make that back to black again i'm

89
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,500
gonna scale this down and you're gonna

90
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,959
notice it scales down the size of the

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,670
pattern here as well you'll notice if i

92
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,070
make this smaller there's now more of

93
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,019
these shapes in here because the smaller

94
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,150
size means more of these shapes can fit

95
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,580
within this circle now it works the

96
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,760
other way as well if i make that larger

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,200
now less of those shapes can fit within

98
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
that circle if you notice here start you

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,310
get starting to get a little bit of a

100
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,540
little bit of distortion in there so i'm

101
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,750
gonna make that a little smaller and

102
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,720
that's how the repeated stretch let me

103
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,370
click on that again repeated stretch

104
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,390
that's how that works

105
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,769
now if you what you want to do is you

106
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,750
can if you want you can add some spacing

107
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,950
between these where it says space and

108
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,070
then click on 5 and it adds 5 units of

109
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,260
spacing between each object right there

110
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,940
if you notice there and that works on

111
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,620
the negative as well if i add negative 3

112
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,239
you'll notice they start to overlap with

113
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,190
each other each of those objects now let

114
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,910
me put that back to zero another thing

115
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,060
you can do is nope there we go another

116
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,530
thing you could do is you can use single

117
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,750
stretched and if you choose single

118
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,739
stretch what it's going to do is it's

119
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,870
gonna take this object and it's gonna

120
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,299
stretch it out all the way you learn all

121
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,690
the way around the perimeter of this

122
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,630
path here now if you know you probably

123
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,890
it's probably hard to tell what that is

124
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,620
but you can if you if you really look

125
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,180
closely you can see it took this object

126
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,030
and stretched it out like that so let me

127
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,500
undo that let me put this back at

128
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,849
repeated stretched and what

129
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,110
you're done once you're happy with how

130
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,969
this looks what you're wanting what you

131
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,649
want to do is you want to finalize it

132
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,749
before you finalize it if you want you

133
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,610
can remove the path and you it'll put it

134
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,199
back to a circle let me undo that

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,659
or you can finalize it by going to path

136
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,779
object to path and now that's no longer

137
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,619
a pattern along path object now this

138
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,179
doesn't just work with circles you can

139
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:53,860
do this with virtually any shape and

140
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,330
I'll show you what I mean let me scale

141
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,039
that down put that out of the way I'm

142
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,709
gonna grab the Bezier pen over here and

143
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,389
I'm gonna click to create a point I'm

144
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,729
gonna hold ctrl bring the line across

145
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,889
the screen like this and then click to

146
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,449
create another point and then press

147
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,699
ENTER on the keyboard and I'm gonna grab

148
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,289
the Edit path by nodes tool and I'm

149
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,969
gonna edit this line a little bit give

150
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,449
it a little bit of a curve that right

151
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,409
there is what I'm looking for or

152
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,569
something like that and now I'm gonna

153
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,769
again and once again I'm going to copy

154
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,679
this right click copy I'm gonna click on

155
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,689
this path I'm gonna add I'm gonna come

156
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,039
back up here to the path effects menu

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,599
click the plus to add a path effect

158
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,050
pattern a long path we want to use

159
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,569
repeated stretched and I'm gonna go

160
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,539
ahead and click link and if you notice

161
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,539
here took the object and it stretched it

162
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,610
a lot and it repeated that along that

163
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,279
path but it took on the properties of

164
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,139
the line that we drew where it had a

165
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,059
one-point stroke in no fill color so I'm

166
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,769
gonna give that a fill color and I'm

167
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,300
gonna get rid of the outline otherwise

168
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,919
known as the stroke by holding shift and

169
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,740
clicking on the X right there and that

170
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,779
right there it took this pattern and it

171
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,029
applied it along this path here now

172
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,259
another thing you can do with this is

173
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,849
you can use this to create like kind of

174
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,019
like a wreath let me show you what I

175
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,309
mean here I'm gonna grab the circles and

176
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,379
ellipses tool I'm gonna hold ctrl and

177
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,809
shift to create a circle like that let

178
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,389
me bring the opacity down a little bit

179
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,159
grab the Select tool duplicate that by

180
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,069
hitting ctrl D and hold ctrl move this

181
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,189
over to the right click and drag over

182
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,610
both of those and go to path

183
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,110
intersection and this shape right here

184
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,399
is what we're looking for I'm gonna

185
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,369
right click that and go to copy and now

186
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,189
I'm going to create another circle I'm

187
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,259
going to hold ctrl and shift click and

188
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,939
drag click and drag to create a circle

189
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,279
convert that to a path by going to path

190
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,060
object to path

191
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,790
and now I will add a path effect to this

192
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,840
again once again pattern along path I'm

193
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,060
gonna choose repeated stretched and I'm

194
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,130
going to go ahead and link it and if you

195
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,720
notice here it's taking this object and

196
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,180
linking it it's it's repeating it around

197
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,100
the outside of that circle so let me

198
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,620
grab the Select tool I want to click on

199
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,780
this object click on it again to get the

200
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,280
rotation handles I'm just gonna hold

201
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,650
ctrl and rotate this to the right a

202
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,450
couple of times like that and if you

203
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,010
notice here on the left side we're

204
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,750
starting to get what appears to be kind

205
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,460
of like this this could be kind of like

206
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,880
a reef like a of a wreath of leaves let

207
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,900
me scale this down to show you I'm gonna

208
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,520
add some spacing in there let me click

209
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,400
on the on the on the path effect here

210
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm gonna add some spacing in there

211
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,710
woops messed something up there there we

212
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,680
go let's add to see how that looks maybe

213
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,150
a little less than that maybe a little

214
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,190
more let me rotate this around a little

215
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,919
bit and as you rotate it it changes the

216
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,350
position as you can see there now I like

217
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,520
how that looks right there I'm gonna

218
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,110
finalize that by clicking on it and

219
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,050
going to path object to path and I'm

220
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,880
going to create another circle inside of

221
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,560
there let me grab the circles and

222
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,500
ellipses tool hold ctrl and shift click

223
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,120
and drag to create a slightly smaller

224
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,180
circle than this one Center it up inside

225
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
of here click and drag over both of

226
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,900
those and Center them up on the center

227
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,410
on the vertical and horizontal axis path

228
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,770
object to path and now I'll click on

229
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,810
this I want these leaves to go the

230
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,729
opposite way the opposite direction of

231
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,080
these so I'm just gonna flip this one

232
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,669
horizontally I'll click on this button

233
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,289
up here that says flip selected objects

234
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,160
horizontally right click that go to copy

235
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,240
click on this path and make that a

236
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,089
little bit bigger and once again I will

237
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:34,458
add a path effect same way as I did with

238
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,059
the other objects repeated stretched

239
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,958
link it and two point spacing like we

240
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,940
did before we make that a little bigger

241
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,520
I think I used less spacing than that

242
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,600
let me bring that down a little bit

243
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,060
okay that looks pretty good right about

244
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,940
there and I will go I will finalize that

245
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,699
by going to path object to path and now

246
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:02,660
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna break

247
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,040
this apart so what this is all

248
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,500
individual pieces I'll go to path break

249
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,769
apart and let me get rid of some of

250
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,410
these extras in here I want to just keep

251
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,000
the left side here so let me get rid of

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,089
these press Delete on the keyboard to

253
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,129
get rid of them and I'll do the same

254
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:23,480
thing over here path break apart let me

255
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,220
get rid of these extras over here like I

256
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,629
said I'm just keeping the left hand side

257
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:32,660
for now and as you can see here we have

258
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,279
like the left-hand side of kind of like

259
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,899
a little accent piece or a wreath like

260
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,420
that let me bring the opacity to this up

261
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,889
let me group it together by clicking the

262
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,199
group selected objects button and now I

263
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,259
can duplicate that by hitting ctrl D

264
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,910
hold ctrl click and drag this off to the

265
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,000
right flip this horizontally and there

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,319
you go now you can put some kind of

267
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:52,490
design in the middle here you can create

268
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,439
some kind of like little law maybe like

269
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,990
an award graphic or some kind of logo

270
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,000
with these sorts of decorations on it

271
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,069
but I think that should do it for this

272
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,600
video that take and go about using the

273
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
pattern along path effects with Inkscape

274
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,350
if you have any questions let me know

275
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,950
and as always thanks for watching

276
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:27,799
