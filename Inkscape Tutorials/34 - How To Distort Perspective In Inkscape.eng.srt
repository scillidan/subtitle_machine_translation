1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,860
so let's go over how you can change the

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,140
perspective of an object using inkscape

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,000
for this demonstration I'll be using a

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
text object so I'm going to grab my text

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,639
tool and I'm going to click on the

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,840
canvas and I'm just going to use the

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,820
word perspective for this demonstration

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,679
and then I'm going to grab my selection

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,480
tool and I'm going to make this a little

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,640
bit bigger so you can see it better

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,320
now what we want to do is open up our

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,820
pathfx menu so I'll come up here to

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,920
where it says path and I will select

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
pathfx

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,699
now in order for this function to work

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,740
the object that we're applying it to has

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,660
to be a path right now this is just a

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,279
text object so let's convert this to a

19
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,399
path by going to path object to path and

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,780
once you've done that you should be able

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,460
to click on this little plus icon down

22
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,899
here in the menu to add a new path

23
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,940
effect and the path effect that we're

24
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,440
looking for is called perspective

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,540
envelope which is located right there if

26
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,980
you're having trouble accessing it you

27
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,059
could just type it into the search bar

28
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,120
up here per s and there it is

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
perspective envelope

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,559
and now all you have to do is grab your

31
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,660
edit paths by nodes tool and if you look

32
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,100
in the corners over here you will see

33
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,960
these four white nodes and you can take

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,300
these nodes and use it to change the

35
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,820
perspective of your object just like

36
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,659
that

37
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,280
now if you want to lock the perspective

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,799
onto a certain axis you can use these

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,900
settings over here in the pathfx menu so

40
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,820
if I select mirror movements in on the

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,740
horizontal axis it'll make it so that

42
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,140
the perspective only changes relative to

43
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,939
the horizontal axis like that as you can

44
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,920
see there and likewise if you use

45
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
vertical it'll lock the perspective

46
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,720
change onto the vertical axis like that

47
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,520
and once you are finished you can

48
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,799
finalize the changes by going to path

49
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,860
object to path and you are done that is

50
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,600
how you can change the perspective of an

51
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
object using inkscape if you found this

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
lesson useful then consider checking out

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
my inkscape master class it's a

54
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,299
collection of over 60 videos where I go

55
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,740
over all of the tools and features in

56
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,020
inkscape and I explain what they are and

57
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,759
demonstrate how they work kind of like

58
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,100
how I did in this video we even have a

59
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,540
private Community where you can ask

60
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,640
questions and get help from me anytime

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
you want and best of all there's no

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,860
monthly membership fees you just pay 17

63
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,899
one time and you're in for Life I'll

64
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,219
have some information about that down

65
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,899
below if you want to check that out as

66
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,099
always thanks for watching
