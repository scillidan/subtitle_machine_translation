00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,719
this tutorial we'll be going over how

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,200
you can create simple animated gifs

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
using inkscape

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,560
now unfortunately inkscape doesn't allow

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,480
you to export animated gifs so what

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
we're going to do is we're going to

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,359
create the frames individually and then

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
open them as layers in and then

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
from there we can export as an animated

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
gif and if you don't know what is

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,119
it's a free and open source image editor

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,079
i'll have a link to that in the

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,280
description of the video if you want to

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,719
download and install that real quick and

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
then you'll be good to get started

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,079
so for my example here as you can see i

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
have this little animated character that

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,280
i create we have some

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
basic facial movements going on here and

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
then we have a sleeping cat on the desk

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
with his tail occasionally moving and

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
the way that i made this was i created

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
these frames individually here in

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
inkscape

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
and what i did was i used the batch

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,559
export feature to export all of these

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
individual images and then open them

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,920
with and then from there i was able

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
to quickly export it so i'm going to

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,719
show you how to do something similar

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
maybe not with this particular design

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,199
i'm going to show you how to create like

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
a simple loading spinner design so let's

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
open up a new document here and get

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
started now i should mention that you

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
should be using inkscape version 1.2 or

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
later in order to follow along with this

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
tutorial because we're going to need the

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
batch export feature which is new to

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
this version if you don't know which

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,880
version you're using just go to help and

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,479
about inkscape

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,920
and it should tell you right there as

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,080
you can see i'm using version 1.2 or

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
version 1.2.1 to be specific so as long

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
as you're using this version or later

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
you'll be good to go

50
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
so i'm going to press 1 on the keyboard

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799
to zoom in to 100

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,920
and i'm going to press down the mouse

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
wheel and move the mouse to get the uh

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,680
canvas off of the page here we're

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,439
actually not going to use this canvas at

56
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,360
all we're going to create rectangles and

57
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
use those for our frames so i'm going to

58
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
grab the

59
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
rectangle tool the squares and

60
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
rectangles tool and i'm going to create

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
a

62
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
vertical rectangle like that

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
maybe a little smaller and i'm going to

64
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
use this handle right here to give this

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,560
a rounded edge we want this to be all

66
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
the way around it like that

67
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,920
and i'm going to make this a lighter

68
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
shade of gray maybe something like that

69
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,038
now i'll grab the selection tool

70
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,720
i'm going to duplicate this by right

71
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
clicking it and going to duplicate and

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
then i'm going to move this down but i'm

73
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
also going to hold ctrl on my keyboard

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
while i move it like that so it locks it

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
onto the vertical axis and now we have

76
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
these two rectangles i'm going to click

77
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
and drag over both of those i'm going to

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
group them together by going to object

79
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
and selecting group

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
and now if i click on this object as you

81
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
can see here we have these scaling

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
handles represented by these arrows if i

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,640
click on this again you'll notice it

84
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
toggles between the scaling handles and

85
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
the rotation handles with this rotation

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
handle selected i'm just going to click

87
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
and drag it like this and then i'm going

88
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
to hold the ctrl key and if you notice

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
as i hold the ctrl key it's locking it

90
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
onto 15 degree increments so i'm going

91
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
to start right here and while holding

92
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,959
control and while holding the click i'm

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
going to press the space bar to make a

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
copy and i'm going to move this over to

95
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,120
the right one two three

96
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
press the space bar again one two three

97
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
space bar again one two three and for

98
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
this last one you can just let go and

99
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
there you go now we have the individual

100
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,400
rectangles for our spinner so let me

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
click and drag over all of this right

102
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
here and let me go to object

103
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
ungroup

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
click off of the graphic to deselect

105
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,519
everything let me just center this up

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,200
here again to move the page around you

107
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
just press down the mouse wheel and move

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
the mouse i'm going to click on this top

109
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,000
one right here and i'm going to make

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
this a darker shade like that

111
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
and now i'm going to click and drag over

112
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
all of this and now i want to group it

113
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
together by going to object

114
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
group

115
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
and let me actually just scale this down

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
a little bit click and drag this to

117
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
scale it down and then i'm going to hold

118
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
ctrl and shift to make this a little

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
smaller

120
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
so i want that to be a little smaller

121
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
like that and now i'm going to create a

122
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,480
rectangle going over it or a square

123
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,159
rather i'm going to click and drag hold

124
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
ctrl to make a perfectly symmetrical

125
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
square like that we don't want rounded

126
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,439
corners on this one so i'm going to

127
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,959
click on this little corner box up here

128
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
that says make corner sharp

129
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,560
and i will make this one white this is

130
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
going to represent the background of our

131
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
design so let me grab the select tool

132
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
let me lower this to the bottom this

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
button right here that says lower

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
selection to the bottom

135
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,480
and now i'm going to click and drag over

136
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
both of these objects and i want to make

137
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
sure that that it's centered up

138
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
vertically and horizontally so i'm going

139
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
to open up the alignment menu which is

140
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
right here the keyboard shortcut is ctrl

141
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
shift a so i'm just going to use that

142
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
instead ctrl shift a

143
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
where it says relative to make sure you

144
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
have last selected enabled and we're

145
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
going to center this up on the vertical

146
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,960
axis and the horizontal axis like that

147
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,680
and i actually don't like the contrast

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
here i'd like this to be a little darker

149
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
so i'm just going to grab the edit paths

150
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
by nodes tool and click on that one

151
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
object right there and i'm going to

152
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
choose a darker shade

153
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
there we go that looks a little better

154
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
okay click off of the deselect so what i

155
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
want to do is i basically want to create

156
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
copies of this for each frame of this i

157
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
want each of these rectangles to be

158
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
highlighted in this color in separate

159
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
frames so let me select this right here

160
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,919
let me press ctrl d to duplicate it

161
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
hold ctrl move it over to the right like

162
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
this and now we have our second frame

163
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
so i want to rotate this around i'm

164
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,919
going to click on this object

165
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
click on it again to get the rotation

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
handles and i'm going to hold ctrl i'm

167
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
going to rotate this

168
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
three steps to the right like that so

169
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,199
now we have another copy of this object

170
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
where this rectangle is illuminated

171
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,479
instead of this one

172
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,680
and if you can see where i'm going with

173
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
this i'm going to create more copies for

174
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
every single one of these rectangles so

175
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
let me zoom out here to zoom in and out

176
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
i'm just holding ctrl and rolling up and

177
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
down the mouse wheel let me create

178
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
another copy of this

179
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
ctrl d

180
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
hold control move it over like that

181
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
click off of it to deselect

182
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
click on the object

183
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
click on it again to get the rotation

184
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,680
handles

185
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
and then hold ctrl

186
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
one two three and there we go now we

187
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
have that one so i'll show you this one

188
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
more time i'm going to click and drag

189
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,160
over it

190
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,000
ctrl d to duplicate

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
hold ctrl move this over here

192
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
click off of it deselect

193
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
click on just this object right here

194
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
click on it again to get the rotation

195
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
handles hold control

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,759
one two three there we go and what i'll

197
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,280
do is i'll just fast forward through

198
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
this real quick

199
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
okay so as you can see i have finished

200
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
making my frames the last one that i was

201
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,319
going to make is this one right here

202
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,680
because the first one is already

203
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
represented by this one right here so

204
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
now we have all of our individual frames

205
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
let me zoom out a little bit so you can

206
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
see it better

207
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
once we are finished making our frames

208
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
what we want to do is group them all

209
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
together individually so i'm going to

210
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
click and drag over this one and i'm

211
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
going to group it instead of going to

212
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
object and selecting group an easier way

213
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
to do this would be to just press

214
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,319
control g on the keyboard so control g

215
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
click and drag over this one ctrl g

216
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
ctrl g and you get the id i'm just going

217
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,599
through and grouping these one by one

218
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,720
and we want to make sure that these are

219
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
grouped so that when we batch export it

220
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
they will all be their own individual

221
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,479
elements each frame

222
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,680
okay so

223
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
now i'm going to close out of the align

224
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
distribute menu what i want now is the

225
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
layers menu so over here where it says

226
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
view objects

227
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,120
click that button right there keyboard

228
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
shortcut control shift and l

229
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
and if i click on these objects you'll

230
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
notice that they highlight as they

231
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,520
select them so i'm going to click on

232
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
this one right here and as you can see

233
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,479
what's highlighted is this

234
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,080
this label right here i want to change

235
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
the name of this from whatever this is

236
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
to the number one because this is the

237
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
first frame in our sequence let me

238
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
double click that i'm going to change it

239
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,759
to one

240
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,120
and press enter

241
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
i'll click on this one this is frame

242
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,479
number two and this one is what's

243
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
highlighted so i'll click on that and

244
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
change that to two

245
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
press enter

246
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
i'll change this one to three

247
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,199
press enter

248
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,160
four

249
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
five

250
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
six

251
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
seven

252
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,199
and eight

253
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
and if you're having trouble seeing

254
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
which layer you have selected sometimes

255
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,599
if you're working with a complicated

256
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
animation you're going to have lots of

257
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
different layers and different frames

258
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
going on here you might have to scroll

259
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
up and down through this list here if

260
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
you have a lot of items to figure out

261
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,000
which which it is that you have selected

262
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
so once we've finished doing that we've

263
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
now have our we now have our individual

264
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,120
layers ready to go i'm going to click

265
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
and drag over all of these objects right

266
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,840
here

267
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
and now what i want to do is open up the

268
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,319
export menu i will go to file and i will

269
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
select export

270
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
now in this menu we want to choose batch

271
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
export and we want to make sure we have

272
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,879
selection we have these three different

273
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
options we have layer selection and

274
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,760
pages we want to choose selections now

275
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
by default if you have all of these

276
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,559
selected you should see it's all ready

277
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,919
to go right here we have these check

278
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
boxes here one two three four it's not

279
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,599
in order but that's okay it doesn't have

280
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,480
to be

281
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,839
and now what i'm going to do is i'm

282
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,320
going to choose a place on my computer

283
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,519
to export these two i'm just going to

284
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
put these on my desktop click this

285
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,240
little folder icon down right here and

286
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
i'm just going to put this on my desktop

287
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
and i'm going to name this

288
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
i'm just going to name this spinner

289
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
click save

290
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,399
leave these defaults as they are and

291
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
click ok and then it will export all of

292
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
those individually

293
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
and they should all be there now on your

294
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
desktop so now it's time to open up

295
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
so that we can turn this into an

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
animated gif so let me open up

297
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
let me open up

298
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,519
and once you have opened what you

299
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,839
want to do is go to file and select open

300
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,920
as layers

301
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,080
now you should see right here i have my

302
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
desktop opened here's the spinner

303
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
graphics spinner one two three four so

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
on and so forth you want to select all

305
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
of these so i'm gonna select it hold

306
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
shift and click on all of these so that

307
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,839
we have them all selected

308
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,560
and go to open

309
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
now this may take a second because it

310
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
has to open up each of these individual

311
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,240
images one by one as you see it doing

312
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,320
here so give it a second to do its thing

313
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
and it should open them in order as long

314
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,839
as you numbered them like i demonstrated

315
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
in the export portion of the lesson they

316
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
should open up an order like that and

317
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,839
now what you can do is you can just

318
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,760
export this as an animated gif so let's

319
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,519
go to file and go to export as

320
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
and i'm going to title this

321
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,839
i'm just going to name this spinner

322
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,680
and over here where it says select file

323
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,519
type i'm going to choose

324
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
gif image and click export

325
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
now this parts really important uh

326
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
you're going to get this menu that pops

327
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
up make sure where it says as animation

328
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
make sure you have this enabled by

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
default when you open up this will

330
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
be deselected if you don't have this

331
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
selected it's just going to export it as

332
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
a static image make sure you have that

333
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
selected right there and this right here

334
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
delay between frames were unspecified in

335
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
milliseconds i think by default it's 200

336
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
now um the number that you should put

337
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
here depends on your graphic but for

338
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
this spinner graphic i'm just going to

339
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
use 100

340
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
if you if you use this number and you

341
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
find out it's too fast or the animation

342
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
is too slow you can always go back and

343
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
change this number later on so i'm going

344
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
to i'm just going to leave it at 100

345
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
press export

346
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,760
and if i go to my desktop it should

347
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
be there

348
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
let me get out of there

349
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
where is uh

350
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
spinner.gif there we go

351
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
it's gonna open this up and there you go

352
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
now we have our spinning our little

353
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
loading spinner

354
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
animation that we created with inkscape

355
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
and with so

356
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
i think that should do it for this

357
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,440
tutorial that is how you can create

358
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
simple animated gifs using inkscape if

359
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
you found this lesson useful then

360
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
consider checking out my inkscape master

361
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,320
class it's a collection of over 60

362
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
videos where i go over all of the tools

363
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
and features in inkscape and i explain

364
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
what they are and demonstrate how they

365
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,279
work kind of like how i did in this

366
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,200
video we even have a private community

367
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
where you can ask questions and get help

368
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
from me anytime you want i'll have some

369
