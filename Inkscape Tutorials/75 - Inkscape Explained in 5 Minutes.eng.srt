1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,719
if you're new to graphic design then you

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,360
may be unfamiliar with what the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,240
different types of design are why

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,359
they're used and how they're made in

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,040
this video I'll be giving you a brief

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,200
overview of what Vector design is in

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,440
particular and how you can use inkscape

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,150
to create

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,050
[Music]

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,960
it this is Nick with logos by nick.com

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,400
and today I'll be explaining how

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
inkscape Works in 5 minutes or less

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,160
inkscape is a free an open source vector

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,880
graphics editor similar to Adobe

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
Illustrator the graphical format you may

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
be most familiar with would probably be

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
the raster format where you're working

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
with a bunch of individual colored boxes

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,039
known as pixels this describes things

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,000
like photographs and jpeg images vector

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
graphics aren't made of pixels though

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
they're a series of mathematical

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
equations that dictate the properties of

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,440
a graphic on an X Andy AIS the benefit

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,160
of working with vector graphics is that

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,879
they're easier to manipulate and you can

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,399
enlarge them infin itely without quality

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,040
loss this makes vectors ideal for things

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,320
like logos and app icons where you'll

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
need to use the same design in a variety

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,159
of different sizes vector graphics can

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,880
also be used to create things like

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,920
characters and mascots digital

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,520
illustrations menu icons for the web and

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,119
they can even be used in combination

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,680
with raster images to create

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,159
advertisements headers for social media

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,360
or anything else you'd like my favorite

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,159
tool for creating vector graphics is

40
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,320
inkscape and on this channel you'll find

41
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,079
hundreds of tutorials for learning how

42
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,960
to use inkscape to create things like

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,000
logos icons posters textures and more

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,680
when you launch inkscape for the first

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,560
time after downloading it you may notice

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
that it doesn't quite look the same on

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,280
your screen as it does on mine when

48
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,320
following along with one of my tutorials

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,600
you can change this by going to edit

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,799
preferences interface and theme and

51
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,960
ticking on the boxes to use a dark theme

52
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
along with the symbolic icons this is

53
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,200
not something that's necessary but it

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
just may be easier for you to follow

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,439
along Ong with my lessons if things look

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
the same on your screen as they do on

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
mine the tools menu on the left hand

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
side of the screen allows you to create

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,038
Vector objects like squares circles

60
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,360
stars and polygons and you can even use

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
tools like the beier pen and the

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,200
freehand tool to draw your own Vector

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,800
shapes you can then edit the structural

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,280
properties of those shapes using the

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
edit pads by nodes tool which allows you

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,840
to change the Contours of individual

67
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,000
lines and the key points of the design

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,160
otherwise known as nodes you can add

69
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
nodes remove nodes and even change the

70
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,319
type of node you're working with you can

71
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,040
then give those shapes whatever color

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
you want using the color palette at the

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
bottom of the screen or you can choose

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,840
Your Colors by RGB or hex code by

75
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,879
opening up the fill and stroke menu you

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,400
can even fill your objects with a

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,360
gradient which is basically a transition

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,400
between two different colors the path

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,959
menu at the top of the screen is a

80
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,920
series of path operations that allows

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,720
you to take objects that you've already

82
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,159
created and turn them into new objects

83
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,159
based on how you make them interact with

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,440
each other you can unify them together

85
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
subtract them from each other use the

86
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,480
intersecting area between them to create

87
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,920
a new object and more there's even a

88
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,959
more advanced feature known as live path

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,599
effects which allows you to manipulate

90
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,760
your vector objects even further

91
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,200
inkscape also has a powerful text editor

92
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
built in that allows you to flow text

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,879
inside of objects wrap it around objects

94
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,799
and even warp it into different shapes

95
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,200
and there's countless other features in

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,000
inkscape that make it a powerful tool

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,360
like texture masking and clone stamping

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
once you have a solid understanding of

99
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
how all of this works you can create

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,560
some really impressive designs there

101
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,239
really are no limitations to what you

102
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,360
can create with inkscape it's just as

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,319
powerful as any other vector graphics

104
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,599
tool out there commercial or otherwise

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
I've personally been using inkscape as

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
my primary tool for over a decade to

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
design logos for my clients and graphics

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
for my own website I even have an online

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
course called The inkscape Master Class

110
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
where I go over every single tool and

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
feature in inkscape and explain how it

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,360
works it's kind of like a user manual

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,280
but in video format where you can ask

114
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,920
questions and get help from me anytime

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
you want and it may be helpful in giving

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,959
some context to my lessons here on

117
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,360
YouTube I'll put a link in the

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,599
description of the video if you're

119
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,040
interested in checking that out

120
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
otherwise if you're just curious about

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
seeing what inkscape is capable of and

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,480
maybe dabbling around with it a bit then

123
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
feel free to check out any of the

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,839
hundreds of tutorials I have on this

125
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,959
channel I even have a beginners playlist

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,240
that would be ideal for firsttime users

127
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,800
if you have any questions just leave a

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,720
