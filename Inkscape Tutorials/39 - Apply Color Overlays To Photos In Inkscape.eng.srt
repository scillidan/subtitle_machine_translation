1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
although inkscape is meant to be a

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,280
vector design app that doesn't mean it

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,759
can't be used to edit photos as well

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,600
in fact i'd even go as far as saying

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,519
that inkscape can handle certain photo

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,040
editing tasks better than some

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
pixel-based editors

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,320
one example of such would be when

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,839
applying color overlays to your

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,520
photographs which we'll be demonstrating

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
in today's tutorial

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,480
[Music]

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,000
before we get started with the lesson

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
i'd just like to take a moment to give a

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,840
special thank you to expressvpn for

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
sponsoring today's video

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,559
expressvpn helps you secure your privacy

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,559
when browsing the internet they do this

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
by routing your network activity through

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,719
their secure and encrypted servers not

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
only does this prevent your isp from

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
seeing your web browsing activity but it

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
also makes it more difficult for

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,320
advertisers websites and government

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
agencies to track you by allowing you to

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,360
mask your ip address

27
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,879
expressvpn only invests in premium

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
servers which makes them consistently

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
faster than other vpns they offer 24 7

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
customer support if you ever need it and

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
setting it up couldn't be easier in just

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
a few clicks i was able to connect and

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
continue on with all of my design

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,119
research with the peace of mind of

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,280
knowing that my privacy is secure

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,360
so to get us started here i'm first

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,560
going to show you how to do this

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,479
manually using a single color with blend

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
modes and then i'll show you how to do

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
this using the duo chrome filter in

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,119
inkscape

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,560
so the first thing i want to do here is

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
import my image onto the canvas now

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
there's various different ways to do

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
this but my preferred way of importing

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
images is to just click and drag the

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
image file onto the canvas let me show

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
you what i mean here if i bring in my

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,799
folder with my image all i have to do is

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,399
just click and drag this onto the canvas

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,079
like that and then i will get this

56
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
little prompt right here that asks me if

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
i want to embed or link it i'm going to

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,719
choose to embed the image and click ok

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,079
and there you go as you can see the

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
image has been embedded

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
so let me zoom out now i'm going to hold

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
ctrl and roll down my mouse wheel to

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
zoom out a little bit so i have a better

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
look at this and to move my page around

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
i'm just pressing down the mouse wheel

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
and moving the mouse

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
now what i want to do is resize the

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
document to be the same size as this

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
image right here so with this image

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
selected press ctrl shift and r on the

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
keyboard and it will change the document

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
to be resized around this image okay so

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,599
now what i want to do is i want to

74
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
create a rectangle and make it the same

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
size as this image so let me right click

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
this image and go to copy

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
let me grab the rectangle tool over here

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
and i'm going to click and drag on my

79
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
canvas to create a rectangle it doesn't

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
need to be the same size as the image it

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
just needs to be any size we're going to

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
address that right now we just go to

83
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,239
edit go to paste size and select paste

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
size and it's going to take the image

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,000
size that i have copied to my clipboard

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
and apply it to that rectangle now i'm

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
going to grab the selection tool and i'm

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
going to change the color of this

89
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,959
rectangle to whatever color i'd like my

90
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
overlay to be so for this example i will

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
use a blue shade so i'll come down here

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,840
to my palette and i will choose a shade

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
of blue like that

94
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
and now i want to center this up over

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
the image so let me hold shift and click

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,879
on the image so i have both the

97
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
rectangle and the image selected and i

98
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
will open up the align the distribute

99
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
menu which is located over here you can

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
also access that by pressing ctrl shift

101
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,519
and a on your keyboard

102
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
within the align the distribute menu i

103
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,159
want to make sure that i have the

104
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
relative two set to last selected and

105
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,720
then once that's enabled we can center

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
it vertically and horizontally like that

107
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
and as you as you can see the rectangle

108
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
should be directly over the image now

109
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
so let me click off of the graphic to

110
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,040
deselect everything i'm going to select

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
just this rectangle right here and now

112
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
i'm going to open up the fill and stroke

113
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
menu which is located up here or you can

114
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
access it by pressing ctrl shift and f

115
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
on the keyboard

116
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
[Music]

117
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,599
once we are in the fill and stroke menu

118
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
if you look down here to the bottom

119
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
right of the menu you will see this drop

120
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
down menu for blend modes by default the

121
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
blend mode is set to normal meaning this

122
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
rectangle looks like a normal rectangle

123
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
with a solid fill

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
we can change the way that this object

125
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
interacts with objects positioned

126
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,519
beneath it though by changing this blend

127
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,200
mode let me show you what i mean here

128
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
i'm going to change this to multiply

129
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
and as you can see it changes the

130
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
appearance of the image or the way that

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,080
the rectangle interacts with the image

132
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
beneath it and if i use my arrow keys i

133
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
can cycle through all of the different

134
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,478
blend modes we have here until i find

135
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,600
the color overlay that i prefer

136
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,199
now this one right here seems to work

137
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,880
pretty well the effect i'm looking for

138
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
is just a simple color overlay and what

139
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
this one does the color blend mode it

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
just takes the color and applies it over

141
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
the image nicely like that without

142
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
making too many other changes i should

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
mention though that every single image

144
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
is different so if you're working with

145
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
the image a different image than this

146
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
you may want to cycle through these

147
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
blend modes to see which one works best

148
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
now as you can see here if i take this

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,240
object and move it off of the image over

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,919
there you can see it looks the same as

151
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
it did before the only difference is the

152
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,440
way it interacts with the objects

153
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,199
beneath it like that and if you don't

154
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,479
like how this works and you want to go

155
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
back to having a regular solid fill

156
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
rectangle at any point you could just

157
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
select it and set the blend mode back to

158
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
normal like that and as you can see it's

159
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
now a regular rectangle again

160
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
so now let's have a look at an arguably

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
easier and maybe even better way to do

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,240
this using the duochrome filter and

163
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
inkscape

164
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

165
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
select my image right here and i'm going

166
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
to come up here to where it says filters

167
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
i'm looking for color and then i will

168
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
choose duochrome

169
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,639
and once you've done that you're going

170
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
to get this little menu right here

171
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,919
the first thing i want to do with this

172
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,680
menu is where it says live preview i

173
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
want to enable that checkbox right there

174
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
and as you can see when i enabled that

175
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
it applied two different colors to my

176
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,160
image it applied the color blue to the

177
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
darker shades and it applied the color

178
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
green to the lighter shades and the

179
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
reason why is because color one up here

180
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
in this tab is set to blue and color two

181
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,440
up here in this tab is set to green now

182
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,639
if you want to change your colors you

183
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
could do so very easily up here say for

184
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
example i want to change the darker

185
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,360
shades from blue to something else like

186
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
pink i can do that as well if i want to

187
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
i can change this like that

188
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
and there we go now we have pink in the

189
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
darker shades i may even want to make

190
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
this a little darker so you can see it

191
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
better but i'm sure you get the idea

192
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
that's one way that you can do that

193
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
and if i come over here to color two i

194
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
could change that the lighter shades to

195
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,400
something like yellow to change up how

196
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
that works

197
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
okay and once you're finished you can go

198
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
ahead and click apply

199
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
and then close out of the menu that is

200
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
how you can go about applying a simple

201
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,360
color overlay or even a duotone effect

202
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
to a photograph using inkscape if you

203
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,759
have any questions let me know and as

204
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,860
always thanks for watching

205
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:42,100
