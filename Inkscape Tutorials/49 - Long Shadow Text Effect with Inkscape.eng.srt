00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,719
you can create this long shadow text

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,199
effect with an aged texture applied to

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,199
it using inkscape

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,560
before we get started though if you'd

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
like to learn everything that there is

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
to know about inkscape be sure to check

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
out my inkscape master class it's a

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,000
collection of over 60 videos where i go

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,679
over all of the tools and features in

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,599
inkscape and i explained what they are

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,440
and demonstrate how they work we even

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
have a private community where you can

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
ask questions and get help from me

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,399
anytime you want i'll have a link in the

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
description of the video if you want to

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,200
check that out so getting us started

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
here in inkscape let's first set up the

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,879
document for our workflow here so i'm

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,239
going to come up here to the top left

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,079
corner and where it says toggle snapping

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,200
i'm just going to make sure that is

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
disabled for now i'll come up here to

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,199
where it says view make sure i have

27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
custom selected and then come up here to

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,879
zoom and zoom in at one to one like that

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,399
now if you notice we have this page

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
border on the screen here i'm just going

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
to press down the mouse wheel and move

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
the mouse to the right just to get that

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
page butter off of the viewfinder for

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,200
now we're going to work out here in open

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,880
space and then when we're done we're

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
going to change the page border to fit

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
the design

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
so once you've done that let's grab the

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
text tool now and create some text i'm

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,479
going to click on the canvas to get the

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,240
blinking cursor and i'm going to use the

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
letters ink for this demonstration

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,920
and i want to select all those letters

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
by pressing ctrl a and change the font

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
up here in the font drop down menu

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
now the font i'm using is over here

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
called varsity team for this sort of

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
design i would recommend using this font

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
right here because of the style of the

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
font it makes it easier to work with i

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
will have a link in the description of

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,600
the video to where you can download and

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
install that font so make sure to go

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
ahead and install that font before

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
getting started

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,680
and once i've done that i'm going to

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
grab the select tool i'm just going to

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
scale this up and i'm going to hold ctrl

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
to lock the proportions like that

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,040
let me move this towards the center over

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
here i'm going to go to path

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
object to path and then go to object

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,560
ungroup and now that is no longer a text

64
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
object these are now individual letters

65
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
so let me click off of that to deselect

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
everything i'm going to take this letter

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
k and bring this over here to the right

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
i'm going to hold ctrl to lock it onto

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,959
the horizontal axis and then i'll do the

70
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,319
same thing with the letter i over here

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
i'll move this over like that

72
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
basically what we're doing here is we're

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
spacing out these letters we want to

74
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
have a lot of space between these

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
letters

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
in order for us to do what we're going

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
to do in this tutorial so once we're

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
finished we'll go back and and bring the

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
letters closer back together but for now

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
we need them spaced out

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
so with them spaced out like that what

82
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
i'm going to do now is click and drag

83
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
over all three of them and go to path

84
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
union so now they're unified

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
so now i will open up the fill and

86
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
stroke menu by going to

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
object

88
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
fill and stroke

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
and that will open up this menu over

90
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
here on the right hand side of your

91
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
screen so i'm going to apply a yellow

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
color to this

93
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
i'm going to give this a linear gradient

94
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
over here in the fill tab i'm going to

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
click this button that says linear

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
gradient i'm going to grab the gradient

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,920
tool

98
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
click on this end of the gradient right

99
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
here and bring the opacity all the way

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
up and i'm going to change this to a

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
different color maybe like a reddish

102
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
orange like that

103
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
and then i'll take this end of the

104
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
gradient and put this down here towards

105
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
the bottom of the text and i'll take

106
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
this end and put it towards the top of

107
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,080
the text like that i'm going to hold

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
ctrl so it goes straight up and down

109
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,200
like that

110
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
so now we end up with some gradient text

111
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
like that

112
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
so what i'm going to do now is let me

113
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
grab the select tool

114
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
i'm going to duplicate this by pressing

115
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,599
ctrl d on the keyboard and it's going to

116
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,440
create a duplicate copy even though

117
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
nothing visually changed on the screen

118
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,640
you can see there is indeed a duplicate

119
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
copy there so i'm going to take that

120
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
duplicate copy and i'm going to make

121
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
that a dark shade of red like that

122
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
and then i'm going to duplicate this

123
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,519
again by pressing ctrl d again and i

124
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,959
will make this one just a random

125
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,239
different color maybe something like

126
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,400
green so we can see it better

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
now i'm going to use my arrow keys i'm

128
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
going to press down on the arrow key and

129
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
then i'm going to press right on the

130
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
arrow key and it's going to offset it by

131
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
two steps like that one down and one

132
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
right and i'm basically going to repeat

133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
that process a few more times

134
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
like that

135
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,720
until we end up with

136
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
this red text looking the way it does

137
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,159
right here basically what i'm doing here

138
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
is i'm creating the inner shadow of this

139
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
text right here

140
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
so that is what i'm paying attention to

141
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
here that size right there is pretty

142
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
good maybe i'll do one more step like

143
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,000
that

144
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
and once you've done that hold shift and

145
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
click on the red text so that you have

146
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
both of those text items selected and go

147
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,880
to extensions

148
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
generate from path

149
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,160
extrude

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
and from the mode i want to make sure i

151
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
have polygons selected and i'm going to

152
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
click apply

153
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
and then click

154
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
close out of that menu by clicking the x

155
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
i'm going to take this green text right

156
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
here or you know what let me undo that

157
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
by pressing control z let me click off

158
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
of the graphic to deselect everything

159
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
first

160
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
and then i'll take this green text

161
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
object and press delete on the keyboard

162
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
to get rid of it

163
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
and then i will take this newly

164
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
generated

165
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
extruded path right here and select that

166
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
make sure you have that selected and not

167
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
the text you'll know you have it

168
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
selected when you see down here in the

169
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
status indicator if i have the text

170
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
selected it's going to be red if i have

171
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
the extruded path selected it's going to

172
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
be

173
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
those partially uh transparent color of

174
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
black right there so let me ungroup that

175
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
by going to object ungroup

176
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,639
and then path

177
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,919
union

178
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,000
and then i will hold shift and click on

179
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
the red text and go to path

180
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
intersection so that we end up with this

181
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
right here where it looks like it's an

182
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
inner shadow on the text it almost kind

183
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
of looks like the text is carved into

184
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
the canvas like that

185
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
so let's click off of that to deselect

186
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
everything what i'm going to do now is

187
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
let me click on just this red text right

188
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
here this red shadow and i'm going to

189
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
give this a linear gradient as well

190
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
i'm going to grab the gradient tool i'm

191
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
going to take the transparent end of the

192
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
gradient and put it down here

193
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,440
and then take the opaque end of the

194
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
gradient and put it up here like that

195
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
again holding shift to lock uh lock it

196
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
onto the vertical axis like that maybe

197
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
i'll bring that down a little more

198
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
okay that looks good

199
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
so let's grab the select tool now i'm

200
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
going to click on the yellow text right

201
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,720
there to make sure i have that selected

202
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
and then i'm going to duplicate that by

203
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
pressing ctrl d

204
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
and i want to give this an outline so

205
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
i'm going to hold shift and click on

206
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
this color yellow down here to give this

207
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
yellow outline and if you zoom in on

208
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
this by holding ctrl and rolling up the

209
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
mouse wheel you can see that there is an

210
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
outline there we want that outline to be

211
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,840
a little bigger though and we want to

212
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,199
get rid of the fill color so let me

213
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
click on the x right here the red x to

214
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
get rid of the fill color and i'll come

215
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
over here to the stroke style menu

216
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,800
and i'm just going to hover my cursor

217
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
over these numbers right here and just

218
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
roll up the mouse wheel to increase the

219
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,360
size of that stroke right there

220
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
and that size right there looks pretty

221
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,479
good i'll leave that as it is where it

222
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,479
says join make sure you have the miter

223
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,919
join right here so we have square

224
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
corners and then let's convert this

225
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
stroke to a path we'll go to object

226
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,599
we'll go to path stroke to path

227
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
now let's zoom out a little bit

228
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,800
so what i'm going to do now is i'm going

229
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
to duplicate that outline by pressing

230
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
ctrl d

231
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
and i will give this a different color

232
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
like green

233
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
and again i'm going to use my arrow keys

234
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,080
down and right

235
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
to move this over

236
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
like that

237
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
and i'll take it about that far what

238
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,800
we're doing with this object right here

239
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
we're creating the base

240
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,400
of the text which is located right here

241
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,840
this dark red area that's what we're

242
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,360
creating right here so you want to

243
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
position it accordingly that right there

244
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
looks pretty good i'll leave that as it

245
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
is and then i'm going to duplicate this

246
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
one more time by pressing ctrl d and i

247
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
will make this one an even different

248
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
color maybe even red and i'll move this

249
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
one down here like this

250
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
or you know what let me make this

251
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,440
let me make this orange for now

252
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
take this

253
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,639
move this down into the left like that

254
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
this one is going to represent the

255
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
shadow being casted here

256
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,479
so that one needs to be placed

257
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,759
accordingly so i'm going to place this

258
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
one over here like that now let's zoom

259
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,039
in on this so we can see it better i'm

260
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,479
going to hold ctrl and roll up the mouse

261
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
wheel i want to select this yellow

262
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
outline that we originally created and

263
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
then hold shift and select this green

264
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,479
outline that we created next and with

265
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,560
them both selected go to extensions

266
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
generate from path extrude

267
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,039
click apply

268
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,479
and then close out of it like that now

269
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,160
let me zoom out a little bit click off

270
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
of it to deselect everything

271
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,319
select the newly extruded area like that

272
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
and go to object on group

273
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,840
and then path

274
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,120
union and then i want to get rid of the

275
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
black stroke going around it or the

276
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
outline so i'm going to hold shift and

277
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
click on the red x over here

278
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,599
and let me come over here to the fill

279
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,640
menu

280
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
under the hsl tab i'm going to come over

281
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,320
here to the alpha channel and bring that

282
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
all the way up so that it's visible and

283
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
then i will send that to the bottom with

284
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,720
this button right here that says

285
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,560
uh lower selection to the bottom

286
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
okay so now i will make that the same

287
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
color of dark red that i previously

288
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,839
applied to that inner shadow right there

289
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,000
so let me apply that color

290
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
and now

291
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
i'm going to select the orange outline

292
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,080

that we have them both selected and go

295
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
to extensions

296
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,279
generate from path

297
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
extrude

298
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,000

302
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
take just this

303
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
black shape right here that we just

304
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
extruded go to object

305
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640

path

307
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
union

308
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
get rid of the black outline by holding

309
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
shift and clicking on the x over here

310
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,440
bring the alpha channel all the way up

311
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
and then send this to the bottom with

312
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,320
this button right here that says lower

313
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
selection to the bottom and i'm actually

314
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
going to take the opacity of this and

315
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
bring that down a little bit for now

316
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
we're going to go back and work with

317
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,120
this later but for now i just want to

318
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
bring that opacity down

319
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
and then we can click off with the

320
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
deselect everything

321
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
so i'm going to take this orange shape

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,959
right here press delete on the keyboard

323
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,279
to get rid of it take this green shape

324
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
right here press delete on the keyboard

325
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
to get rid of it

326
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
and if i zoom out you can see it's

327
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
starting to come together here i want to

328
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,959
add some more color in here first though

329
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
so let me select this base of the text

330
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
right here this dark red object and i'm

331
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
going to give this a linear gradient

332
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
and i'm going to grab the gradient tool

333
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,959
and i'm going to make this end of the

334
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,399
gradient

335
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,839
first of all let me make that fully

336
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,120
opaque like that and i'm just going to

337
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
make this a lighter color of red like

338
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,279
that and i'll take the lighter end of

339
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
the gradient put it down here and the

340
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
darker end of the gradient goes up here

341
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
like that

342
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm

343
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,320
going to fill in the base of the text

344
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
here with shapes as you can see here

345
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,399
it's darker down here at the bottom and

346
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
it's darker over here and these little

347
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
lips that come off the top of the of the

348
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
letters there

349
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
so let's go and add that in i'm gonna

350
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
grab first of all let me grab the select

351

here now in this under the snapping menu

354
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
i want to make sure i have this one

357
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
rectangular corners and if that's grayed

358
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,880

regular bezier path select that one

369
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
first for whatever reason this version

370
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
of inkscape always defaults to this one

371
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
right here so you will if you're using

372
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
this version of inkscape you'll have to

373
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,839
manually click on that

374
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,480
so let me snap to this corner and click

375
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
snap to this corner and click

376
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
same thing over here

377
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,519
same thing over here and then back to

378
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,440
the starting point like that and we have

379
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
that shape that we just drew in there

380
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
like that i want to come back over here

381
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
i'm going to draw this shape in here

382
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
like this as well

383
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,279
and again to move the page around like

384
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
that i'm just pressing down the mouse

385
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
wheel and moving the mouse i'm going to

386
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
come over here and fill in this shape as

387
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
well

388
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,120
do the same thing down here

389
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,320
and then i'll come up here and fill in

390
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
this part of the top of the letter right

391
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,279
here and then i'm just going to go

392
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
through and do this for the rest of the

393
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,839
text

394
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
okay so once you're finished drawing the

395
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
shapes let's grab the select tool over

396
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,440
here let's turn off snapping now we

397
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
don't need that anymore i'm going to

398
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
click and drag over the bottom of the

399
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
text down here just to select those

400
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
objects that i've just drawn

401
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
and i'm going to make them a darker

402
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
shade of red so let me grab the uh the

403
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
uh dropper tool which is located over

404
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
here or you could press the letter d

405
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
and i'm going to sample this color right

406
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,360
here to make that darker i might even

407
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
make that a little darker than it

408
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,839
currently is

409
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,200
and then i want to get rid of the black

410
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
outline by holding shift and clicking on

411
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
the x and there we go

412
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,920
i'm going to do the same thing up here

413
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
to these items let me zoom out a little

414
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
bit i'm going to click and drag over the

415
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
top of the text to select those items

416
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
right there and i will make those a

417
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
darker shade of red as well let me hold

418
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
shift click the red x to get rid of the

419
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
outline and for this i want to make this

420
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
one a little darker as well

421
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
okay looking better

422
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,519
okay so at this point let's grab the

423
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
select tool and click off of the the

424
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
graphic to deselect everything at this

425
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,399
point we're almost done we're just going

426
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
to start bringing these letters together

427
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
now so i'm going to click and drag over

428
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,959
everything here

429
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
to make sure everything is selected and

430
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
then grab the edit paths by nodes tool

431
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
click and drag over these nodes right

432
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
here for this letter over here and i'm

433
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
just going to hold the left arrow key to

434
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,880
bring this letter over like this

435
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
so that it's closer together to the

436
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
other letter

437
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,399
okay looking good and then i'll click

438
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,079
and drag over all of these letters right

439
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
here or just these two letters and then

440
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,519
bring both of those over by again

441
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
holding down the left arrow key

442
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
okay looking good and you can grab the

443
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,240
select tool now and click off of it to

444
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
deselect everything and what we're going

445
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
to do next is let's create the

446
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,639
background this um this colored

447
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
background with the gradient for the

448
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
text here so let's go back in there what

449
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
i'm going to do is i'm going to grab the

450
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
rectangle tool

451
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,320
and create a rectangle going over the

452
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,000
text like that

453
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,040
and i'm going to send that i'm going to

454
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
grab the select tool i'm going to lower

455
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
that to the bottom

456
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
and then i'm going to open up the align

457
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
and distribute menu which is located

458
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
over here or you can

459
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,199
press the letters uh control shift and a

460
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,360
on your keyboard

461
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
and from the relative two i want to make

462
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,199
sure i have last selected chosen

463
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,880
with this rectangle selected i'm going

464
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,959
to hold shift and click on the text item

465
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
right there and just make sure i have

466
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
that centered up on the vertical and

467
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,959
horizontal axis and now i'm going to

468
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
change the page border to fit this

469
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
selection to do that just press ctrl

470
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,959
shift

471
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
r on the keyboard and if you click off

472
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,320
it to deselect everything you can see

473
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
that the page border now represents that

474
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,639
shape there so let me ctrl z that to put

475
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,720
that back i'm going to change the the

476
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
color of this background here let me go

477
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
to the fill and stroke menu i'm going to

478
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
make this a lighter shade of purple

479
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
maybe something like that

480
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,079
i will give this a radial gradient

481
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,839
grab the gradient tool

482
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
click on this end of the gradient up

483
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,959
here and bring the opacity of that all

484
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
the way up and i'm going to double click

485
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
this line right here to add a new stop

486
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
into that gradient

487
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,920
now i'm going to take this middle stop

488
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
this center node of the gradient and i'm

489
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
going to make that lighter like that

490
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,480
and i'll take this end of the stop right

491
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,160
here and i'll make that slightly lighter

492
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,480
not by much just a little bit

493
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
and then i'll bring this out a little

494
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,480
bit like that let me bring this stop up

495
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
like that i'm going to hold ctrl

496
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,959
to bring that up and then i'll take this

497
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
end over here i'm going to hold ctrl and

498
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
shift and bring this out like that

499
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
let me just adjust that a little bit

500
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
okay looking pretty good

501
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
so what i will do now is i will grab the

502
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,000
select tool i will take the text right

503
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
here bring the op take the text shadow

504
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
rather bring the opacity all the way up

505
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,240
and i want to make this a similar shade

506
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
as this purple over here so let me grab

507
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
the dropper and sample that right there

508
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
and there we go now you can grab the

509
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
select tool and you can make this you

510
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
can make the shadow darker or lighter

511
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,279
based on your own preference so i'm

512
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
going to leave mine

513
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,120
right about there

514
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
so the final step of this tutorial would

515
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
be to add the texture to the finished

516
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
design here so to do that

517
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,440
before i do that what i want to do first

518
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
is i want to open up the layers menu

519
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,759
which is located over here or you could

520
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
press ctrl shift and l on the keyboard

521
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
to open that up

522
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
now if you notice here everything that

523
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,199
we've created so far exists on this one

524
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
layer i want to put the texture on its

525
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
own layer so i'm going to click this

526
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,639
button up here that says create a new

527
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,160
layer

528
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
i'm going to leave the default as it is

529
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
make sure you have the position set to

530
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,399
above current and click add and there's

531
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,680
our new layer

532
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
so i'm going to take my texture image

533
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,199
i'll have a link in the description to

534
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,639
where you can download this texture

535
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
image just go ahead and copy and paste

536
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,800
it into your document here or you can

537
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
just click and drag the file onto your

538
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
canvas which is what i'm going to do

539
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
make sure you have layer 2 activated so

540
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
it places it on layer 2 and i'm going to

541
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
click and drag it onto my canvas like

542
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,959
that

543
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,880
and the the options i'm going to choose

544
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
here i want to choose embed i want to

545
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,679
choose default import resolution and

546
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
then none and then click ok

547
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
and there's the texture image so let me

548
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,240
select this rectangle right here the

549
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,439
background and i'm going to right click

550
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,359
this and go to copy

551
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,799
and then i want to select the texture

552
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
image and i want to go to edit

553
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
paste size

554
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
paste size and that's going to make it

555
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,319
the same size as the background there

556
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,679
and now what i can do is i can select

557
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,880
the texture

558
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
hold shift select the background so we

559
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
have them both selected come back over

560
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
here to the align distribute menu and

561
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
center that up vertically and

562
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
horizontally like that and then click

563
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,039
off it to deselect everything

564
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
now what i will do is i will select just

565
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
the texture image

566
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,960
come back over here to the layers menu

567
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
and where it says blend mode i'm going

568
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,160
to set this to soft light

569
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,559
right there

570
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
and there you go that is how you can

571
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
create that uh long shadow text now once

572
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
you apply that

573
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,520
you may want to change a few things like

574
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,480
i'm going to zoom in on this a little

575
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
bit that shadow looks a little lighter

576
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
now that the texture has been applied so

577
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

578
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
lock layer 2 up here so that i can't

579
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
change the texture

580
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
and i'm going to continue working on the

581
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,760
objects down here so with layer 2 locked

582
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
the texture stays in place and you won't

583
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
be able to move it so i'm going to

584
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,720
select layer 1 and then i'll come over

585
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
here i'm going to select the shadow let

586
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,919
me come back over here to the fill and

587
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,679
stroke menu maybe make that a little

588
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,679
darker

589
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,440
that looks good and i'm going to grab

590
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
the gradient tool and maybe change the

591
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,559
gradient of this inner shadow right here

592
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
maybe bring that down a little bit so

593
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
that's a little more visible

594
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
okay looking good let me go back to the

595
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
select tool now if you want to bring

596
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
down the intensity of that texture what

597
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,039
you can do is you can come back over

598
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
here to your layers menu you can select

599
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
layer two you can unlock it

600
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
and if you can unlock it and if you want

601
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,039
what you can do is you can select this

602
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
image come back over here to the fill

603
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
and stroke menu and you can change the

604
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
opacity of the image to control the

605
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
intensity of that texture like that so

606
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
i'm going to put it back up to 100 to

607
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,679
where it was because i like how that

608
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,440
looks like that and that should do it

609
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
for this tutorial that is how you can go

610
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
about creating this long shadow text

611
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,240
effect using inkscape if you have any

612
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
