1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,279
how you can create noise gradients using

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:06,120
inkscape and the example I'll be

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,879
applying it to is this eyeball that

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,800
will'll be recreating so let me open up

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,759
inkscape and we will get started so the

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,240
first thing I'm going to do is draw a

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,639
circle so I'm going to grab the circles

9
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,840
and ellipses tool and I'm going to hold

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,320
control and shift on the keyboard and

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,000
click and drag to create a circle that

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,760
starts from the

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,720
inside and then I'm going to make this

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,840
circle white and then I'll grab my

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
selection tool and I will right click

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,640
this and go to duplicate and I'll make

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,040
this duplicate copy black and I want to

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,840
apply a radial gradient to this black

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,120
copy so I'm going to open up the fill

20
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,079
and stroke menu if you don't have the

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,719
fill and stroke menu opened on your

22
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,079
screen you could just click on this

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,600
color stripe down here where it says

24
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,719
fill and it'll open up that menu and

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,600
Under The Fill tab I'm going to click on

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,120
this button right here that says radial

27
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,719
gradient when you hover your cursor over

28
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,640
it and now I want to reverse this

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,559
gradient so that black is on the outside

30
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,719
and transparency is on the inside so let

31
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,280
me grab the gradient tool over here and

32
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm going to click this icon up here in

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,280
the tool settings menu that says reverse

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,920
the direction of the

35
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,200
gradient and then I'll zoom in on this

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm going to double click the path the

37
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,640
gradient path right here to add a new

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
stop and I'm going to bring this out a

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,240
little bit and then I'll hold control

40
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,000
and shift and grab this gradient handle

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,520
and just bring this in a little bit like

42
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,079
that and now I'll zoom out so this is

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,600
the gradient let me adjust this just a

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,880
little more this is the gradient that I

45
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,040
will be applying the noise gradient to

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,479
so let me grab my selection tool let me

47
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,040
move this over a little bit I'm going to

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,799
come up here to where it says filters

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,640
I'll go to overlays and I will choose

50
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm looking for noise fill from this

51
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,079
list and I'm going to take this

52
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,399
menu I'm going to tick the box down here

53
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,280
that says live preview and when I do

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,960
that you can see there is a noise uh

55
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,719
filter applied to the gradient there now

56
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,600
a couple of things to keep in mind first

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,840
things first I want to come over here to

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
where it says noise color and I want to

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
take this a channel and make sure I have

60
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,039
this all the way down to zero if you

61
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,799
don't see an a channel here just come up

62
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,560
here to this drop down and choose hsl

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
from this list and now I'm going to come

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
back over here to the options Tab and

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,040
the setting that we're going to pay

66
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
attention to the most over here is

67
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,200
dilation we're going to have to adjust

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,560
this dilation slider based on the color

69
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
that you're working with and how intense

70
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,599
you want the uh noise effect to look so

71
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,280
if I bring this up you can see it takes

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
away a lot of the effect but if I bring

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,040
it down you could see more of the effect

74
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,920
and I'll have to adjust this according

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,200
to my own preferences so for this design

76
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm going to bring this pretty low right

77
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,840
about there I think maybe a little

78
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,400
more and that looks pretty good and once

79
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,959
you have that applied you can click the

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,720
apply button and now the noise gradient

81
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,159
is applied now if you want to intensify

82
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,040
this effect you can apply it a second

83
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,760
time so let me click on live preview

84
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,720
again and you can see we can have we

85
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,760
have a second effect that we're applying

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
there I like how mine looks the first

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
time so I'm just going to deselect this

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm going to close out of this menu and

89
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
one thing to keep in mind if your

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,159
gradient looks a little blurry if the

91
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,560
quality looks kind of low uh it may have

92
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,959
something to do with the settings so

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,680
come up here to inkscape preferences I'm

94
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,799
going to go to inkscape and I'm going to

95
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,799
click on settings if you're using

96
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,840
Windows just press control shift p on

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
the keyboard and in this search bar I'm

98
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,159
going to type

99
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,000
filter and I'm going to come down here

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
to where it says filter effects quality

101
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,280
I have I have best quality set for my

102
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,599
settings here and that gives you the

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,920
sharpest clearest appearance for this

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,560
filter effect that we're applying so if

105
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,319
yours looks a little blurry and soft

106
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,120
it's probably because you have average

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
or maybe a lower setting uh so set it to

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
best quality and close out of the

109
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,879
menu and now we can grab the gradient

110
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,040
tool and we can adjust this like any

111
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
other gradient you can see we have this

112
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,280
noise effect here that's applied to the

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,480
gradient so I'll just adjust this a

114
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,519
little further and now I'm going to

115
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,400
create the rest of the eyeball so let me

116
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,640
grab my ellipse tool let me deselect

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,599
everything by pressing the Escape key

118
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,680
and I'm going to snap to the center

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Center here and I'm going to hold

120
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
control and shift and draw another

121
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,720
Circle and I will make this one a

122
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,239
lighter shade of blue and then I'll grab

123
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
my selection tool right click go to

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
duplicate and I'll make this second one

125
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
a darker shade of blue and just like I

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,639
did previously this will be the one that

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
I apply the noise gradient too so let me

128
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
apply a radial gradient I'll go back to

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,160
my gradient tool I'll reverse the

130
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,560
direction of the

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
gradient and I'm going to zoom in on

132
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
this a little bit I'm going to double

133
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,759
click the path and just adjust this a

134
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,039
little bit there we

135
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,039
go and now I'm going to apply that

136
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,680
effect again so let me grab my selection

137
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,440
tool I will go to

138
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
filters overlays and choose noise fill

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,479
and I'm going to move my menu over click

140
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,479
the live preview button and you can see

141
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,479
we have the noise effect there and I'm

142
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,080
going to adjust my dilation again just

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,800
so I have the effect that I want now if

144
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,440
you notice here previously we used a

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
lower setting to get that effect for

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
this color I'm going to use a higher

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
setting I'll click apply close out of it

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
and now I can go back to my gradient

149
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,520
tool and adjust this as needed so I'll

150
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,680
make this oops let me undo that I'm

151
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,240
going to adjust this a little

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
more that's a little closer to the

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
effect that I'm going

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
for and then I'll press the Escape key

155
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,600
to deselect everything and I'll grab my

156
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,400
circle tool again and create the black

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,880
circle for the center of the eye I'll

158
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,120
hold control and shift and create

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
another Circle and it looks like this

160
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
one's already black this is actually a

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,759
dark gray I'm going to make this black

162
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,479
there we go and you can grab your

163
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,840
selection tool and you can choose just

164
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,240
how much you want the eyeball to be

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
dilated

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
there and then finally I'm going to

167
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,680
apply a drop shadow behind everything

168
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
here so let me grab my circles and

169
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,639
ellipses tool again snap to the center

170
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
click and drag to draw another

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,759
Circle I'll make this one black grab the

172
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,080
selection tool and I'm going to lower

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
this one to the Bottom by clicking this

174
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
button up here in the tool settings menu

175
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,440
that says lower to the

176
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,880
bottom and for this one I'm going to

177
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
apply a and blur so I'll come down here

178
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,080
to the blur slider and I'll bring that

179
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,199
up like that and now I will apply

180
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,360
another noise overlay to this so let me

181
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,880
go to filters overlay and I will choose

182
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
noise fill click live

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
preview and again we can adjust this as

184
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
needed and I like how that looks so I I

185
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,080
will finalize it by clicking apply close

186
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,240
out of the menu and there you go we've

187
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
created that eyeball design that uses

188
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,599
noise grading and like I mentioned

189
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,360
previously these gradients are editable

190
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,120
like any other gradient say for example

191
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,360
I wanted to change this from a radial

192
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
gradient to a linear gradient I could

193
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,880
just click on the linear button and now

194
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,680
if I grab my gradient tool you can see I

195
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
have the editable linear gradient like

196
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,759
that but I liked how it looked

197
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,840
previously so I'll put that

198
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
back and there we go that should do it

199
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,240
for this tutorial that is how you can

200
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,599
apply noise gradients to objects using

201
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
then consider checking out my in inape

203
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,039
master class it's a collection of over

204
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,800
60 videos where I go over all of the

205
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,759
tools and features in inkscape and I

206
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,400
explain what they are and demonstrate

207
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,199
how they work kind of like how I did in

208
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
this video we even have a private

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,919
Community where you can ask questions

210
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,360
and get help from me anytime you want

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,039
and best of all there's no monthly

212
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,800
membership fees you just pay $17 one

213
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,919
time and you're in for Life I'll have

214
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
some information about that down below

215
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
if you want to check that out as always

216
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
thanks for
