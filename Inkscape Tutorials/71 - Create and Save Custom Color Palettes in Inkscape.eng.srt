00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,680
this is knit with logos by Nick comm and

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,420
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,250
how you can create your own custom color

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,529
palettes in Inkscape and save them to

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,450
your installation so that you can load

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,130
them up and work with them at any point

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,960
in the future if you'd like and if you'd

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,340
like to learn more about how Inkscape

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,990
works be sure to check out my Inkscape

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,510
masterclass it's a collection of over 60

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,250
videos where I go over every tool in

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,349
future in Inkscape and I explain what it

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,360
is and demonstrate how it works I'll

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,589
have a link in the description of the

15
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:36,750
video if you want to check that out so

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,129
to get us started here as you can see I

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,960
have Inkscape opened up on my screen and

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,370
if you look down here to the bottom of

19
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,600
the page you'll notice we have this

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,070
color palette that we normally work with

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,110
an Inkscape and if you click this little

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,879
arrow icon over here to the bottom right

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,949
you'll get this little flyout menu with

24
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,480
a bunch of different color palettes to

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,670
choose from now by default

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,829
Inkscape has the Inkscape default

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,809
palette here when you load it up but you

28
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,010
can choose from any of these other

29
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,109
options here like for example if you

30
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,180
click on greens it'll give you a wide

31
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,420
spectrum of green shades to choose from

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,250
and coloring your objects and there's a

33
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,599
whole bunch of different options in here

34
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,740
if you want to check it out you can look

35
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,569
at something like a bun sue here where

36
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,509
this looks as if it's the Ubuntu

37
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,550
branding colors so on and so forth now

38
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,630
what you can do is you can actually

39
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,910
create your own color palette and add it

40
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,830
to this list using the technique I'm

41
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,149
going to show you in this tutorial so

42
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:26,220
let me set this back to Inkscape default

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,729
for now

44
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,440
and let me just set up the document here

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,450
I'm gonna go to file document properties

46
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,970
and I want to turn off the visibility of

47
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,950
the page border for now so where it says

48
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,989
show page border just deselect that for

49
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,300
now and I'm gonna come up here to the

50
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,789
grids tab and I'm going to add a new

51
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:45,929
rectangular grid click on new and where

52
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,090
it says spacing X and space and Y I'm

53
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,270
going to change each of those to 100 so

54
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,039
that there's 100 pixels of space between

55
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,190
each grid line close out of that we're

56
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,119
gonna go to view zoom zoom in at 1 to 1

57
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,700
so that we have a 100% view of the

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,560
document here and then finally I'm going

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,690
to open up the fill and Stroke menu with

60
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,610
this button up here or you can press

61
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,430
control shift + F on the keyboard so

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,420
what I'm going to do now is I'm

63
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,250
basically going to create a bunch of

64
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,740
objects and color them all in with

65
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,790
whatever shade

66
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,709
like to be included in my custom color

67
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,030
palette that I'm gonna load up in here

68
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,829
so I'm going to grab the squares and

69
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,959
rectangles tool and I'm going to create

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,359
a square within these grid lines and I'm

71
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,909
going to color this in with a shade that

72
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,700
I would like to save maybe something

73
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,950
like that and I'm going to create

74
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,250
another shade I would like to save maybe

75
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,099
something like that then create

76
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,760
something else maybe something like that

77
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,689
that's looking pretty good

78
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,310
and we're going to do is I'm just going

79
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,359
to go through and I'm gonna create a

80
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,920
bunch of different objects and I'm gonna

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,629
color them all in with colors that I

82
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,000
like that I'd like to save to my custom

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,629
color palette

84
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,980
okay so as you can see here I've gone

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,240
through and I've created a bunch of

86
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
different squares and I've colored them

87
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
in with colors that I'd like to save to

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,460
my palette once I'm finished what I'm

89
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,540
going to do is I'm going to click off of

90
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,520
the graphic to deselect everything and

91
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,070
then I'm gonna come back to the document

92
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,870
properties by going to file document

93
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,600
properties and let's come back over to

94
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,570
the page tab and I'm going to turn the

95
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,310
visibility of the page border back on

96
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,950
and I'm gonna come over here to where it

97
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,050
says resize page to content I'm going to

98
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,300
expand to that menu and I'm gonna click

99
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,980
this button right here that says resize

100
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,340
page to drawing or selection and that we

101
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,630
can close out of that menu and that's

102
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,040
gonna do what that's gonna do is it's

103
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,890
gonna make the document size fit the

104
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,240
size of the graphic that we've created

105
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,340
here and all I'm gonna do now is I'm

106
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,570
just gonna save this I'm gonna go to

107
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,900
file save as and for now I'm just gonna

108
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,670
save this to my desktop I'm going to

109
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,250
give it whatever name I'd like the name

110
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,020
of the color palette to be in this list

111
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,820
when I bring it up so I'm just gonna for

112
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,680
demonstration purpose isms going to name

113
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,660
this u2 palette and I'm actually going

114
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,010
to save this I'm not going to save this

115
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,990
as an SVG file I'm going to save it as a

116
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,350
dot GPL file or a palette file and

117
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm gonna go ahead and click Save now

118
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,610
let me close out of Inkscape here let me

119
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,480
minimize this what we have over here I

120
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,459
have this on my desktop this is the GPL

121
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,400
file I'm going to open up a window I'm

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
actually gonna open up a folder and go

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,990
to wherever it is that you have your

124
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,610
Inkscape whatever Drive that you have

125
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,920
Inkscape installed on for most of you is

126
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,990
probably going to be your C Drive for me

127
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,850
I have it saved on my e Drive so I'm

128
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,050
gonna open up the e Drive

129
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,230
I'm gonna look for Program Files I'm

130
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:48,540
gonna go to Inkscape share Inkscape and

131
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,630
palettes and if you noticed here we have

132
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,520
an index of all of our color palettes

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,350
that are included with our Inkscape

134
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,940
installation so I'm just going to take

135
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,310
this YouTube palette GPL and click and

136
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,230
drag this into the folder go ahead and

137
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,670
click continue to give it permission to

138
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,490
do so and all we have to do now is

139
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,560
restart Inkscape so let me come back up

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
here let me close out of Inkscape

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,500
and let me just load it back up make it

142
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,790
fullscreen there we go and let's click

143
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,130
on this arrow again and there you go

144
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,050
YouTube padlet the GPL if you click on

145
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,930
that there is our custom color palette

146
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,480
based on those colors that I used in

147
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,220
that previous document you can now color

148
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,400
this in however you would like so I

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
think that should do it for today's

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,010
tutorial that is how you can go about

151
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,350
creating your own custom color palettes

152
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,510
in Inkscape and saving them so that you

153
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,100
can work with them in the future if you

154
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,480
have any questions leave a comment below

155
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,620
