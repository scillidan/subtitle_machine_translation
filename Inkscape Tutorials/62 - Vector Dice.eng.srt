00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,960
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,320
you can create this vector dice

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,280
illustration

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
using inkscape and if you'd like to

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
learn more about how inkscape works be

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
sure to check out my inkscape master

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,880
class

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
it's a collection of over 60 videos

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
where i go over all of the tools and

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,279
features in inkscape

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,640
and i explain what they are and

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,160
demonstrate how they work i'll have a

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,359
link in the description of the video if

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,880
you want to check that out

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
so to get get us started here in

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,680
inkscape the first thing we want to do

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,120
is set up our documents so that we are

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,960
all working with a similar workflow

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
to do that we'll come up here to where

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
it says view make sure you have custom

23
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,120
selected

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,160
and then we'll come up here to where it

25
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,200
says zoom and zoom in at one to one

26
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
and then up here in the snapping menu i

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,239
just want to click this icon over here

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,520
to the top left that says enable

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,800
snapping as you can see i already have

30
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
it enabled

31
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,039
and these are the options we're going to

32
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
want enabled for this tutorial right

33
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,920
here where it says

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,879
snap nodes pads and handles enable that

35
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,399
and then over here where it says

36
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,320
snap to cusp nodes and then right next

37
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,959
to it where it says snap to smooth nodes

38
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,240
and once we've done that i'm going to

39
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
open up the align and distribute menu

40
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
with this icon

41
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,080
over here or you can press ctrl shift a

42
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
where it says relative to i want to set

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,200
that to last selected

44
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,439
and then i'll open up the um fill and

45
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
stroke menu over here with this icon or

46
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,159
you can press ctrl

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,759
shift and f on your keyboard to get that

48
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,479
open so once we have that open the first

49
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,159
thing we want to do is create a polygon

50
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,119
so i'm going to come over here to the

51
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,960
stars and polygons tool

52
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
and over here from these settings i want

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
to choose polygon rather than star

54
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
where it says corners i want to make

55
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
sure we have six and then rounded and

56
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
randomized both set to zero as you can

57
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,000
see i already have these values

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
set beforehand you will probably have to

59
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
change these manually so go ahead and

60
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
type those in

61
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
and once you do that just click and drag

62
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,360
on the canvas to create a polygon i'm

63
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
going to hold ctrl

64
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
and then click and drag the mouse up

65
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
like that so that it creates the polygon

66
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,680
where the points

67
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
are going vertically as opposed to

68
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,799
horizontally

69
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
that right there is what we're looking

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
for once we've done that i'm going to

71
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
take this move this towards the center

72
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,159
of the page

73
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
i want to bring the opacity of this down

74
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
a little bit i'm going to take this

75
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
opacity over here and just drop that

76
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
down roughly in half and i'm going to

77
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,360
scale this down a little bit i'm going

78
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,878
to hold ctrl and shift

79
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
and just click and drag to scale that

80
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
down

81
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
what i want to do now is duplicate so

82
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
i'm going to right click this and go to

83
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
duplicate

84
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
and i'm going to click and drag this up

85
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
here until these two corners snap so we

86
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,120
get something like this here where

87
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
there's this diamond shape intersecting

88
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,840
between the two of them

89
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
and i want to make this red just so we

90
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
can differentiate it from the original

91
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
then i want to duplicate that object

92
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
again i'm going to right click that and

93
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
go to duplicate

94
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
come over here snap this over to the

95
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
left side over here

96
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
and then do that one more time right

97
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,920
click duplicate

98
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
and snap this one over to this right

99
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,160
side like that and with this red

100
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
polygon still selected i'm going to go

101
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
to edit

102
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,760
select same and click on fill color

103
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
it's going to select all of the objects

104
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
on your canvas that have the same

105
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
red fill which is these three objects

106
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
right here and i want to combine those

107
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
together by going to path

108
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
combine and once we've done that i just

109
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,000
want to click and drag over

110
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
the entire thing entirely like that so

111
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
we have everything selected including

112
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,319
the red

113
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
object and the original polygon in there

114
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
and then go to path

115
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,879
division and what's going to happen

116
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
after you do that you can click off of

117
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
the graphic to deselect everything

118
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,680
you'll notice this has been broken up

119
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
into three individual parts here so let

120
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,959
me just undo that by hitting ctrl

121
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
z now what i'm going to do is i'm going

122
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,560
to create three

123
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
individual sides for the dice here so to

124
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,159
do that i'm going to grab the squares

125
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,440
and rectangles tool

126
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
and i'm going to hold ctrl and shift on

127
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,000
the keyboard and i'm going to click and

128
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
drag to create a perfectly symmetrical

129
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
square like that

130
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
and since this square is going to

131
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
represent one of the sides of the dice

132
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,959
what i want to do is round the corners

133
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
of this because as i demonstrated in the

134
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,159
um

135
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
in the thumbnail the dice has rounded

136
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
corners so i'm going to take this little

137
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
handle up here to the top right this

138
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,920
circle node

139
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
i'm just going to click and drag that

140
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,400
down like that so we get some nice

141
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,040
rounded

142
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
nice rounded corners like that and now i

143
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
want to create circles for the inside of

144
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,680
this

145
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
rectangle that represent the number on

146
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
the dice so i'm going to grab the

147
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
circles and ellipses tool

148
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
hold ctrl and shift and click and drag

149
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
to create a perfectly round circle like

150
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
that

151
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
i want to make this a different color so

152
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
i'll make this green

153
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
let me grab the select tool place this

154
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
over here in the center

155
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
i mean the top left right click that go

156
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,040
to duplicate

157
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
hold control click and drag this over to

158
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
the right and the reason why i'm holding

159
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,240
control is because it's locking it onto

160
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
the vertical axis like that

161
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
and then i want to hold shift and click

162
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
on the other one so we have them both

163
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,639
selected

164
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
right click that go to duplicate hold

165
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
control click and drag these ones down

166
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,479
here

167
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,080
and then click off of it to deselect

168
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,919
everything and then just take one of

169
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,280
these right here

170
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
right click them and go to duplicate and

171
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
then hold shift

172
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
and click on the red rectangle so that

173
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
you have the circle and the green

174
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,040
rectangle uh the red rectangle selected

175
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,919
and center them up

176
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,720
on the vertical and horizontal axis like

177
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
that

178
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
now if you notice here i made my circles

179
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
a little too big so what i'm going to do

180
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,440
is i'm just going to click and drag over

181
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
those circles

182
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
hold ctrl and scale those down a little

183
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
bit

184
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
i'll take this one hold shift click on

185
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,639
both of those

186
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
click and drag these down here click off

187
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
of the deselect

188
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
i'll take these ones as well again shift

189
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
clicking them so we select them both

190
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,600
bring them over here

191
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
and let me try this again i'll take this

192
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,360
one in the center hold shift

193
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,919
click on the uh the red rectangle there

194
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,199
center it up on the vertical and

195
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,639
horizontal axis

196
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
that's good now we can click off of that

197
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,759
now we want to do is just make sure that

198
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
we have these green ones in the corners

199
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,120
centered up as well so let me click on

200
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
the green one right here

201
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,720
hold shift click on the other four on

202
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
all four of them and group them together

203
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
by clicking this button that says group

204
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
selected objects

205
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
or you could press ctrl g and then hold

206
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
shift and click on the red rectangle and

207
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
just center those up on the vertical and

208
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
horizontal axis like that

209
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
and then we can go ahead and ungroup

210
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
them so this right here is going to

211
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
represent one of the sides of the dice

212
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
now i want to do what i want to do is

213
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
create two more sides

214
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
so to do that i'm going to click and

215
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,919
drag over all of these

216
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
and i want to duplicate them by going to

217
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
right click by right clicking and going

218
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,479
to duplicate

219
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,360
then hold ctrl and just click and drag

220
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,039
this over here to the right

221
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
click off of it to deselect everything

222
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
i'm just going to delete these two

223
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
circles right here i'm going to

224
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
click on it to select it and press

225
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
delete same thing over here press delete

226
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,199
so then we end up with the number three

227
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
and then finally i will create one more

228
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,479
of these

229
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
right click it go to duplicate hold ctrl

230
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
click and drag it to the right

231
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
click off of it to deselect and then get

232
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
rid of these on the uh

233
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,639
on the sides here so that we have just

234
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
the one in the middle

235
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
so what i'm going to do now is i'm going

236
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
to select all of these green ones right

237
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
here i'm going to click and drag over

238
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,919
those green

239
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
objects to make sure you just select the

240
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
green object make sure you don't

241
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,960
select the red object as well so like

242
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
just the green objects right there

243
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
unify them together by going to path

244
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,479
union

245
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
and then hold shift and click on the red

246
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,000
rectangle and go to

247
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,880
path difference and i want to do the

248
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
same thing over here select all of these

249
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
go to path union hold shift click on the

250
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
red rectangle and go to path

251
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,000
difference and then finally i'll come

252
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
over here click on the green circle

253
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,599
hold shift click on the red rectangle we

254
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,039
don't have to do a union on these ones

255
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
because it's just one object

256
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,680
and go to path difference so now we have

257
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
our three sides to the dice here so i'm

258
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,560
going to

259
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
click and drag over all of these let me

260
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,360
hold ctrl and shift and scale these down

261
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
and i want to place these over where

262
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
they're going to be implemented so i'm

263
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
going to take this top one the number

264
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
five put this on top

265
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,599
i'm going to take this over here the

266
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
number three put this on the left

267
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
and i'll take the number one and put

268
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
this on the right over here what i'm

269
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,199
going to do is

270
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
change the perspective of each of these

271
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
objects so that they fit within this

272
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
polygon

273
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
so let me zoom in on this by holding

274
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,360
ctrl and rolling up the mouse wheel

275
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
let me click on just this red rectangle

276
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,639
right here and go to

277
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,759
path path effects and it's going to open

278
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
up the path effects menu there it is

279
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
right there

280
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
and with the path effects menu open i'm

281
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,680
going to press the plus icon

282
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
and what i'm looking for is perspective

283
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,560
so i'm going to come up here to where

284
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,080
the search icon is i'm going to start

285
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,879
typing

286
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,479
p-e-r-s and there we go perspective

287
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,280
envelope that's what we want

288
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
and once we've done that come over here

289
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
to the edit paths by nodes tool

290
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
and what we're looking for right here if

291
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
you notice there's different there's two

292
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
different types of nodes there's gray

293
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,039
nodes

294
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
inside of the object and then there's

295
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,039
white nodes on the corners what we're

296
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,160
looking for

297
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
is the white nodes on the corners that

298
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
allows us to change the perspective so

299
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559
let me zoom back out

300
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
again to zoom in and out i'm just

301
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
holding ctrl and rolling up and down the

302
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,159
mouse wheel

303
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
to move the page around i'm just

304
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
pressing down the mouse wheel and moving

305
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
the mouse

306
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,000
let me take this white node and snap

307
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
this into the

308
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,279
bottom corner of this top object let me

309
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
take this white node and snap that into

310
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,000
there

311
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
take this node snap it into there and

312
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,839
then this one

313
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
into there like that and now i will

314
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
finalize that by going to path

315
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
object to path now let's do the same

316
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
thing over here let's click on this

317
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,519
go to uh we're going to come over here

318
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
to the path effects menu

319
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
click on the uh the plus button right

320
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,480
here

321
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
we're going to add perspective envelope

322
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
and do the same thing i'm going to take

323
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,040
this corner and snap it into here

324
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
take this corner snap it into here

325
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
this corner goes down here and this

326
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,839
corner goes in here

327
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,720
and again finalize that by going to path

328
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
object to path

329
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
and then i will do the same thing for

330
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,680
this object as well so let me select

331
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,279
that

332
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
add a new path effect perspective

333
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
envelope

334
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
and then snap these to their respective

335
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
corners as well

336
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,160
i'll put this one down there and then

337
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,440
again we're going to finalize this by

338
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,000
going to

339
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,600
path object to path

340
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,800
so let me zoom out a little bit i'm

341
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,240
going to hold ctrl roll down the mouse

342
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
will zoom out let me grab the select

343
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
tool

344
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
what i want to do now is put a little

345
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
bit of space between these three sides

346
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,440
because they're all touching each other

347
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
which is not

348
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
visually correct for what we're trying

349
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
to create so let me select each of these

350
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
red objects by shift-clicking them

351
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
and then just move them off of the uh

352
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
the polygon

353
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
for for a brief moment and i want to

354
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
reduce their size by 95

355
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
so i want to come up here to where it

356
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,399
says width and height or w and h

357
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
i want to turn on the lock right here so

358
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
it locks the proportions as we scale it

359
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
and right here these units of

360
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
measurement where it says px i'm going

361
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
to change that to percentage

362
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
and i'm going to change the width to 95

363
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
so we're going to reduce the size by 95

364
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
i mean by 5 hit enter and then just

365
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
change that back to pixel so that you

366
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,200
can

367
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
use that later on and then let me click

368
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,519
off of that to deselect everything

369
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
i want to take this object right here

370
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,279
hold shift click on the left side of the

371
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,240
polygon

372
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,519
center it up on the vertical and

373
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
horizontal axis do the same thing over

374
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,959
here take this right

375
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,360
right side object hold shift click on

376
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
the polygon

377
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
center it up on the vertical and

378
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
horizontal axis and then finally the

379
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,959
same thing over here we're going to

380
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,560
center it up

381
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
on the vertical and horizontal axis and

382
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,200
that's what we're looking for right

383
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
there a little bit of space between

384
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,680
those uh

385
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,839
those sides of the dice now what we want

386
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
to do is click on

387
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
one of the black objects in the

388
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
background the original polygon you'll

389
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
know you have it selected when you see

390
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
the black stripe down here in the bottom

391
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,120
left make sure you don't accidentally

392
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,600
click the

393
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
the red object click the black object in

394
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,880
the back there

395
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,320
and go to edit select same and click on

396
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
fill color

397
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
and it's going to select all three of

398
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,120
those objects and we want to unify those

399
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
together so let's go to path

400
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,519
union and now i'm just going to scale

401
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,720
this up a little bit

402
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
if you notice here this is the reason

403
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
why we're going to scale this up if you

404
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
notice here

405
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,079
the padding between the red object and

406
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,279
the black object

407
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,360
is thinner than the padding between

408
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
these two red objects

409
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
i want to scale this up so that it

410
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,839
matches that oops

411
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
i want to scale this up so that it

412
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,639
matches that a little more closely i'm

413
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
going to hold ctrl and shift

414
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
and just scale it like that if yours is

415
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
too big you may have to scale it down

416
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
just so just go ahead and manually

417
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
adjust it so it looks about right

418
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
right about there looks pretty good and

419
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
what i want to do now is round to the

420
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,880
corners

421
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,839
of this um polygon here so to do that

422
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
i'm going to add another path effect

423
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
and the path effect i'm going to look

424
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,959
for this time is called corners

425
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
corners philip chamfer that's what we're

426
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
looking for click on that

427
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
and i'm going to click this button right

428
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
here that says add a fillet or just

429
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,240
click

430
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
fill it and now i'm going to come back

431
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
over here to the edit pads by nodes tool

432
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,600
and if you notice we're going to have

433
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,519
these green nodes in each corner so let

434
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,800
me click and drag over all of those

435
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
green nodes

436
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,399
let me zoom in a little bit and i'm just

437
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,680
going to take one of those green nodes

438
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,800
and just click and drag and if you

439
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
notice it's going to round to the corner

440
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
as we do that

441
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,040
and that right there is what we're

442
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,399
looking for that looks perfect so let me

443
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,720
finalize that by going to path

444
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,760
object to path let me grab the select

445
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
tool we can close out of the path

446
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
effects menu now we shouldn't need that

447
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,920
again

448
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
so we have the structure of the dice in

449
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
place all we have to do now is color it

450
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,880
in so

451
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
let me take this top object right here

452
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
and let me break it apart by going to

453
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,399
path

454
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,279
break apart and then i want to hold

455
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:07,920
shift

456
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
and click on the large red object so

457
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
that we just so that it deselects it and

458
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
we just have these circles selected

459
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
and i want to raise those circles to the

460
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
top by clicking this button that says

461
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,279
raise selection to the top

462
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
and i'm going to make those white and i

463
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,560
want to do the same thing over here

464
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
select this object

465
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,279
path break apart hold shift

466
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
click on that red object to deselect it

467
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
make these white

468
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,320
and then raise them to the top and then

469
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
finally the same thing over here select

470
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,399
that

471
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,199
path break apart hold shift

472
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,600
click on the object to deselect it make

473
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
that white

474
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
raise it to the top now let me zoom back

475
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,240
out let's click and drag over everything

476
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
and bring the opacity of it all the way

477
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
up so let's click off

478
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
to deselect everything now what we can

479
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
do is we can choose

480
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
colors to use for our dice i know in the

481
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
thumbnail i use the color green i think

482
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
for this one i'll use blue

483
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
you can use whatever color you'd like so

484
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
i'm going to start with the base back

485
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
here the black object

486
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
and start with the darker variation of

487
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
whatever shade you want to use if you

488
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
want to make your dice green start with

489
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,800
dark green if you want to make it

490
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
orange start with a dark orange i'm

491
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
going to start with a dark blue

492
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
over here and then i'm going to click

493
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
over here under the fill tab where it

494
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
says

495
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,040
linear gradient i'm going to click that

496
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
to give it a linear gradient

497
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
and then i'm going to grab the gradient

498
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
tool which is over here or you can just

499
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,079
press

500
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,000
g on the keyboard and if you notice we

501
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
have a dark blue on this stop and we

502
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
have transparency on this stop so let me

503
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
click on that stop to select it

504
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
and i want to make this a lighter shade

505
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
of the color we want so since i'm using

506
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
blue i'm going to go with lighter shade

507
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,839
of blue

508
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,360
let me put this stop over here on the

509
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
bottom we want the dark one on the

510
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,519
bottom

511
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
take this one the lighter one on top

512
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,360
hold ctrl bring this straight up so that

513
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
it locks it onto the vertical axis like

514
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
that

515
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
and uh it may be helpful to turn off

516
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
snapping at this point because snapping

517
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
we don't need it anymore and it's just

518
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
going to get in the way from this point

519
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,920
forward so

520
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,519
up here where it says enable snapping we

521
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
can disable that

522
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,839
and now i want to click on this red

523
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,120
object right here and i want to make

524
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,199
this an even darker color than the dark

525
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,160
shade of blue

526
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
used over here so let me make this a

527
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,120
dark shade of blue like that

528
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
that looks pretty good and let me give

529
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,160
that a linear gradient

530
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
and i want to take this dark side and

531
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
put this to the top left corner

532
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
take this one bring it down here like

533
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
that

534
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,839
and then i want to take this object

535
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
right here and give that the same

536
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
gradient so we'll click on linear

537
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,759
gradient and instead of creating that

538
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,560
again we can just

539
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
choose it from this list right here it's

540
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
this one we just created

541
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
put this one right here like that and

542
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,480
put this one down here in the

543
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,199
bottom right corner there we go and then

544
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,399
up here

545
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
we're going to use an even lighter shade

546
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,759
of our color than we used for up here so

547
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,880
i'm going to choose an even lighter

548
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
shade of blue like that

549
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,519
or maybe that looks pretty good and then

550
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
we will give that a linear gradient as

551
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
well

552
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
take this and put this down here and

553
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,079
then take the transparent stop and put

554
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
it up top you can hold control

555
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
to lock it onto the vertical axis like

556
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
that now let me grab the select tool let

557
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
me zoom out a little bit

558
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,320
if you can see our dice our vector dice

559
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
