00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,200
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,880
this lesson we'll be going over how to

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,679
use markers in inkscape now markers are

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
useful because they allow you to take a

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
single object and repeat it along a path

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
without deforming the object in previous

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,920
lessons we went over how to use pattern

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
along path which is really useful for

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
creating unique designs and patterns but

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
the downside of using this tool is that

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,679
it deforms the object as it flows along

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
the path here and there's no way to turn

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
this feature off so in order to get this

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
result right here we need to use markers

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,760
so let's go ahead and demonstrate how to

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
do this so here we are in a new document

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,800
the first thing i'm going to do is

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
create the path that i'd like the object

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,120
to flow along now you can use virtually

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
any path that you'd like for this

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,840
demonstration i'm just going to use a

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
simple circle so i'm going to grab the

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
circles and ellipses tool i'm going to

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
click and drag and hold ctrl to create a

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
nice round circle with the aspect ratio

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
locked like that

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
and the way markers work in inkscape is

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
everywhere that there's a node a marker

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
will be placed so what i want to do

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
first here is convert this circle to a

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
path let me go to path object to path

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
and then i'll go to the edit paths by

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
nodes tool and as you can see here we

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
have nodes here in these four quadrants

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
of this shape now what i'm going to do

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,640
is i'm going to take an object and i'm

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
going to convert it to a marker and i'm

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
going to apply the marker to this path

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
so that there's going to be the object

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
at each of these four points right here

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,320
so let me actually go ahead and create

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
the object now now the object that i'm

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,079
going to use for a marker is just a

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,159
simple star i'm going to grab the stars

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,240
tool and i'm going to draw a star like

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
that

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,880
now you can use whatever shape you'd

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
like you can use a logo you can use an

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
icon you can use text any vector object

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,759
you'd like can be used as a marker so

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
let me turn this blue just so we have

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
some differentiation here

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,320
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,399
convert this object to a marker now

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,320
before you convert your object to a

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
marker if you'd like to keep a copy of

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
the shape on hand i would recommend

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
creating a duplicate copy of it because

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
once we convert this to a marker the

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
shape is going to disappear off of the

61
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
canvas so let's say you want to keep

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
this shape i'm going to right click this

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
and go to duplicate and i'm going to

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
take this duplicate copy and then i'll

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
go to object and i will select

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
objects to marker

67
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
and now it's going to disappear off the

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
canvas like that so let me grab this

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
shape right here i want to apply the

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
marker to this shape let me open up the

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
fill and stroke menu which is located

72
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
over here or you could press ctrl shift

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
and f on the keyboard

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
and i'm going to remove the fill and

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
stroke fill from here so let me click

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
this red x down here to get rid of the

77
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
fill we don't want any fill or any

78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
stroke on here we want to leave this as

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
an invisible shape and then what i will

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,680
do is i'll come over here to the stroke

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
style tab now if you notice we have

82
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
these three input boxes right here where

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
it says markers

84
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
now the way this works is

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
the ones in the front

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
the first one and the last one are the

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
first and the third this represents the

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
start point of the path and this

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
represents the end point of the path and

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
this represents all of the nodes

91
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
in the middle of the path that go along

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
the path so to demonstrate how this

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
works let me grab let me

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
click this drop down right here and i'm

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,120
going to grab this star and apply that

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
as the start node

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,159
i'm going to grab this end one and i'm

98
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
going to apply this star as the end node

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
there's nothing visibly changing on my

100
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
screen here because i'm using a closed

101
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,200
path if you're using a linear path like

102
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
a straight line you should see a star at

103
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
this at the front and at the back of the

104
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
path like that and then i'll apply this

105
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
one to all of the nodes in the middle

106
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
like that and as you can see here we now

107
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
have this object going along the path

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,920
now if we want to add more objects in

109
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
here we can just add new we can just add

110
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,040
more nodes so let me come over here to

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
the edit paths by nodes tool

112
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,319
i'm going to click and drag over all of

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
the nodes to select them like that and

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,519
i'm going to click this button over here

115
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
that says insert new nodes into selected

116
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
segments

117
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
and as i insert new nodes like that it's

118
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
going to insert

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
more of the object as you can see here

120
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
now if at any point you want to alter

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
this you could just click on one of

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
these nodes and you can move it around

123
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,200
like that as you can see here

124
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
now let me go ahead and undo that

125
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
because that's not the result i was

126
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,959
going for

127
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,879
now let's say you want to alter these

128
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
markers further you want to make them

129
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
bigger or smaller or maybe even rotate

130
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
them to do that what you could do is let

131
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
me first go back to the selection tool

132
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
if you click on one of these drop downs

133
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
over here where the markers are we have

134
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,478
this new revamped menu as of inkscape

135
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
version 1.2 with all of these neat

136
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
little options that we can edit if you

137
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
click on the button that says edit on

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
canvas

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
you're going to get these transformation

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
handles now let me zoom in on this by

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
holding ctrl and rolling up the mouse

142
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,280
wheel

143
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
how this works is the transformation

144
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
handles that are squares allow you to

145
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,120
distort and scale the object like that

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,080
so i can control the width the height

147
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,759
and i can just scale it down by holding

148
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
ctrl if you want to lock lock the

149
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
proportions like that you can make it

150
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,680
bigger

151
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
or smaller as you can see there now if

152
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,759
you want to rotate the object all you

153
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,199
have to do is click on this round node

154
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
right here and allow you to rotate the

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
object like that

156
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
pretty simple

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
and if at any point you want to get back

158
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
to this let's say you deselect it and

159
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
you get out of here if at any point you

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
want to get back to editing that all you

161
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
have to do is select the object and then

162
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,039
come over here and click the drop down

163
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
and click on edit on canvas and you can

164
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
edit that again like that

165
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
okay so i think that should do it for

166
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
this lesson actually no there's one more

167
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
thing i want to mention about this

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,560
feature whenever you have markers on a

169
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
path they behave sort of like a stroke

170
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,000
so over here this button right here that

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
says when scaling objects scale the

172
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
stroke width by the same proportion

173
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
if this if this option is disabled as it

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
is on my screen that means as you scale

175
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
this object down

176
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
the stars are going to say are going to

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
stay the same shape

178
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
so marker that you have applied will

179
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,840
remain the same shape regardless of how

180
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
big or small you make the path that it's

181
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
placed along if you'd like the markers

182
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,800
to scale alongside the object all you

183
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,479
have to do is enable this setting right

184
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
here and now it'll scale with it like

185
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
that without changing its size

186
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,759
so i think that should do it for this

187
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
lesson that is how you can go about

188
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
using markers in inkscape to repeat an

189
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
object along a path without deforming it

190
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,759
if you found this lesson useful then

191
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
maybe consider checking out my inkscape

192
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
master class it's a collection of over

193
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
60 videos where i go over all of the

194
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
tools and features in inkscape and i

195
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
explain what they are and demonstrate

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
how they work kind of like how i just

197
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
did in this video we even have a private

198
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
community where you can ask questions

199
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,319
and get help from me anytime you want

200
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,680
i'll have some information about that in

201
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,199
the description below if you have any

202
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,800
questions let me know and as always

203
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,440
thanks for watching
