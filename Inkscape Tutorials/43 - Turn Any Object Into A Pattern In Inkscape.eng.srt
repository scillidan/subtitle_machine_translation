1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,920
one of the greatest advantages that

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,600
comes with using inkscape is having the

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,920
ability to create repeat patterns from

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,559
simple shapes objects and even groups of

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,880
objects in fact not only can you use

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
vector objects to create patterns in

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
inkscape you can even use text objects

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
clipped objects and even jpeg images in

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,279
this tutorial we'll be showing you

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,760
exactly how

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,840
so getting us started here inkscape

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,079
makes the process of turning an object

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,320
into a pattern incredibly easy let me

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,079
show you what i mean using a simple

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,680
shape just to get us started and then

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
i'll show you a working example of how

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,879
you can actually use this in a practical

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,760
sense

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
so i'm going to start off with a star

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,520
i'm going to use the stars and polygons

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,600
tool i'm going to choose star instead of

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
polygon and i'm going to use these input

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,480
settings right here in case you'd like

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
to follow along with what i'm doing

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360
now i'm just going to click and drag on

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
the canvas to create my star i'm going

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
to move the cursor up like that and i'm

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
going to hold ctrl and ctrl and shift so

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
that we have a nice upright star like

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
that

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
now i'm going to make this green just to

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
have a different color grab the

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,360
selection tool and let me scale this

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,200
down a little bit i'm going to hold ctrl

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
to lock the proportions and scale that

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,880
down like that

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
and now to turn this object into a

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
pattern all you have to do is make sure

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,759
you have it selected and go to object

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
pattern and select object to pattern

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,799
okay now nothing visibly changes on your

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
canvas but that object will now be

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
registered as a pattern in your fill and

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
stroke menu so let me show you how you

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,640
can apply it now i'm going to grab the

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
rectangle tool i'm going to click and

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
drag on the canvas to create a simple

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
rectangle like that

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
just for the sake of simplicity i'm

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
going to convert this to a path so i'll

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,439
go to path and select object to path

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
and now i want to change the fill

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
property of this rectangle from a solid

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
color to a pattern so to do that we're

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,320
going to use the fill and stroke menu

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
which is located over here

57
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,079
and what we are looking for is under the

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
fill tab we have all of these different

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
options for filling our object we're

60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
looking for this option right here that

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
says pattern when you hover your cursor

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,000
over it i'm going to click on that

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
and if you use this drop down right here

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,959
you should see a list of all the

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
different patterns that inkscape has in

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,879
it already now the patterns that you

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,480
create custom made patterns are going to

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
be labeled as pattern with a series of

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
random numbers after it i don't know why

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
this is the case uh but for whatever

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
reason inkscape will name your patterns

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
this and as far as i know there is no

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,760
way to change the name of these patterns

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,040
so look for something titled pattern

75
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,640
3786 or whatever your numbers will be

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
and select that

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
and uh the the pattern is actually

78
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,519
applied there you can't really see it

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,959
though because it needs to be scaled

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
down so to scale this down let's work on

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
editing our pattern

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
i'm going to grab the edit pads by nodes

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
tool over here

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,120
and what we are looking for is we're

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
looking for these handles the first

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
handle we're looking for is right here

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
this little let me zoom in on this this

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,319
little crosshair this x represents the

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
location of the pattern relative to your

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,360
object

91
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
now if i want to move the location of

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
the pattern i could just click and drag

93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
this x like this to move the pattern

94
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
within the object like that you probably

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,640
couldn't see exactly what happened there

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
because the pattern's too large i have

97
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
to scale it down so let's do that let me

98
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,440
zoom out a little bit i'm going to hold

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,879
ctrl and roll down the mouse wheel a

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
couple of times

101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,239
and i'm looking for some more handles

102
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
out here i don't know why but for some

103
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
reason inkscape puts these handles all

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
the way out here in space sometimes so

105
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,720
you'll have to look around for them and

106
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
they're tiny too they're hard to see so

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
we're looking for this square handle

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
right here which represents the size of

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
the pattern

110
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
and then we're looking for this circular

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
handle right here which represents the

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
rotation of the pattern

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,959
so let me take the square handle over

114
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,480
here and scale this pattern down i'm

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
going to hold ctrl

116
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
while i'm doing this i'm bringing the

117
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
square handle towards the center point

118
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
that crosshair that x and as i do this

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640
i'm holding ctrl to lock the aspect

120
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
ratio and as you can see the pattern is

121
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
getting smaller and we're seeing more of

122
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
those stars in there let me zoom in on

123
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
this so you can see this better

124
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,360
this scaling handle

125
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,799
allows you to

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
resize your pattern as needed as you can

127
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
see here and if you want to rotate your

128
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
pattern you can use this handle right

129
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
here

130
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
holding control will lock the rotation

131
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,159
onto 15 degree angles the same as it

132
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,920
would with any other transformation that

133
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
you would make in inkscape and again if

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
you want to move the location of the

135
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
pattern you just have to click and drag

136
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,120
this crosshair like that and move this

137
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
around as you can see here

138
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
and there you go that is how you could

139
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
take an object and turn it into a simple

140
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
pattern

141
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
so let's go over a working example of

142
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
how you would actually use this feature

143
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
to create a pattern design

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
for an example here i have this simple

145
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
avocado graphic that i created i'm just

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
going to click and drag over everything

147
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,639
here and group all of these shapes

148
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
together by going to object

149
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
and selecting

150
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
group now the good thing about working

151
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
with patterns in inkscape is that it

152
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,040
allows you to create patterns from

153
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
virtually anything it doesn't just have

154
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
to be a single shape or a single object

155
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
it could be a grouping of objects it

156
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
could be a text object it could be a

157
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
masked or a clipped object it could even

158
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
be a jpeg image so virtually anything

159
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
you want in inkscape can be turned into

160
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,880
a pattern okay so i'm going to turn this

161
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
group of vector objects into a pattern

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
now when i create my pattern i don't

163
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
want all of the copies of this graphic

164
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
to be touching each other side by side

165
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
as you can see here by the bounding box

166
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
what i want to do is increase the size

167
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
of that bounding box so that these

168
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
objects have some spacing between them

169
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
as they repeat in the pattern so what

170
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,240
i'm going to do is i'm going to copy

171
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
this object i'm going to right click it

172
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
and go to copy

173
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
and i'm going to create a rectangle

174
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
like that

175
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
and i want to make this rectangle the

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
same size as my object i'm going to go

177
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
to edit

178
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
paste size and i'm going to choose paste

179
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,479
size

180
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
grab the selection tool lower this

181
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
beneath the object click and drag over

182
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
both of these so we have them both

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,919
selected and i'm going to center this up

184
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,240
on the vertical and horizontal axis

185
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
using the alignment menu which is

186
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
located over here

187
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
it should open up on the right hand side

188
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
of your screen and i want last selected

189
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
chosen from this drop down and i'm just

190
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
going to align this on the vertical and

191
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,759
horizontal axis like that

192
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
okay so now i'm going to click off of

193
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
this to deselect everything what i want

194
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
to do now is take this object and add

195
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
some padding around it so that we have

196
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
some spacing going around this avocado

197
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,319
graphic

198
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
so what i'm going to do up here where it

199
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
says the width 328 i'm just going to add

200
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
100 to each dimension so i'm going to

201
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
make this

202
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
uh 400

203
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
and i'm going to make this over here the

204
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,919
height

205
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,440
500

206
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
and now we have a little bit of padding

207
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
there let me center that up center that

208
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
up let me see how that looks okay we

209
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
have some more pattern but maybe not as

210
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
much as i'd like i'm going to add

211
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
another 100 to each dimension so let me

212
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,639
make this 500

213
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,160
and then i'll make this one 600

214
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
and let me try that again let me center

215
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,639
that up

216
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
okay that looks a little better

217
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
so now i'm going to grop i'm going to

218
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,680
group these two objects together i'll go

219
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
to object and select

220
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,800
group

221
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
and i'm just going to scale this down

222
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
and put this off to the side

223
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
i'm going to select this make sure i

224
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,759
have it selected go to object

225
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,880
pattern

226
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
objects to pattern and let's say i want

227
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
to use this as a background for like a

228
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,759
thumbnail i'm going to design the

229
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,240
average thumbnail design is 1280 by 720

230
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
pixels so i'm going to grab the

231
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
rectangle tool

232
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
click and drag like that and let me grab

233
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
my selection tool and i'm going to

234
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,599
change the width and height of this to

235
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,199
1280

236
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
by 720 like that and i want to resize my

237
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
canvas to fit this object so i'm going

238
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
to select the object and press ctrl

239
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
shift and r on the keyboard and it'll

240
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,039
resize the document to fit that object

241
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
now i'm going to take this object right

242
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,599
here

243
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,199
go back to the fill and stroke menu and

244
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,280
i'm going to choose my pattern and as

245
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
you can see there's the pattern so what

246
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
i want to do is grab the edit paths by

247
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
nodes tool

248
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
and look for the placement put that in

249
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
the center

250
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
look for the scaling handle scale that

251
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,039
down

252
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,560
oops

253
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
there we go

254
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
and as you can see we have our avocado

255
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
pattern that we created

256
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
using inkscape and i could even rotate

257
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,680
this around a little bit just to give it

258
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
a little bit of a

259
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
design flare there we go

260
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,800
okay you got to make sure you're

261
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
grabbing the correct cross hair here

262
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,280
there we go

263
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
and there we go that is how you could

264
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
take a simple object and turn it into a

265
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
repeat pattern that you can use to fill

266
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,520
objects however you'd like in inkscape

267
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
before i end this video if you found

268
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
this lesson useful then consider

it's a collection of over 60 videos

271
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
where i go over all of the tools and

272
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,879
features in inkscape and i explain what

273
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
they are and demonstrate how they work

274
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
kind of like how i did in this video we
