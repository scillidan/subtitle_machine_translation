1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,680
in today's lesson we'll be having a look

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,840
at a path effect in inkscape that allows

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,279
you to draw in mirror mode it works by

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,160
creating a copy of what you've created

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,759
and mirroring it on an opposing axis

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,480
what's more any edits that you make to

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
the original copy will also be applied

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,510
to the mirrored copy let's have a

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,420
[Music]

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
look so getting us started here at

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,720
inkscape the first thing I'm going to do

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
is demonstrate how this feature works

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,159
and then I will give you a working

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
example of when this sort of feature

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,280
would be useful so to start us out here

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,960
let's create a circle I'm going to grab

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,280
the circles and ellipses tool and I'm

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,000
going to hold control on my keyboard and

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
click and drag so we get a nice round

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,000
circle like that now what I'm going to

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,360
do is I'm going to use the mirror

22
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,399
symmetry path effect to create a

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,000
mirrored copy of this object and

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,879
whatever I do to this object will also

25
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,840
happen to the mirrored object let me

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
show you what I mean with the circle

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,399
selected I'll go to path and I will

28
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,600
select path

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,960
effects and from the path effects menu

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
over here I'm going to choose the little

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,719
plus icon down here in the bottom right

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,879
corner I'm going to click on that to add

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,240
a new path effect and the path effect

34
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm looking for is called mirror

35
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,759
symmetry which is right there you could

36
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,439
also access it by just typing into the

37
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,520
search bar here m i r r begin typing it

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,400
and there it is right there mirror

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,320
symmetry and as you can see there it's

40
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
going to take the uh object and create a

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,479
cloned copy over of it over here on the

42
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,560
right hand side now if you want to edit

43
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
this object just grab your edit paths by

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,520
nodes tool and you should notice Let Me

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,840
zoom in on on this you should notice

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,520
this blue line going between the two

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,560
objects now if I take this node in the

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
center and move this over like this you

49
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,560
can see that I'm moving the object the

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,320
Clones copy away from the original one

51
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,159
and these nodes down here I can use

52
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,280
these nodes to rotate the Clones copy

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
like that if need be the bottom one

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,399
rotates it that way and the top one will

55
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,320
rotate it this way like that okay so the

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,799
way this works is anything I do to this

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,399
object will also happen to this object

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,039
so if I select this object and then make

59
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,360
this green both objects will become

60
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,799
green if I take this node right here and

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,200
bring in the width like that as you can

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,038
see the width of the other object

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
changes as well like that and now we are

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,560
drawing in mirror symmetry so once I'm

65
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
finished using this effect and I want to

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
finalize this I can go to path object to

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
path and if I grab my nodes tool I

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,239
already have it selected you can see

69
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,720
these are now two individual paths these

70
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
are no longer linked as mirrored copies

71
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,319
these were just individual paths that

72
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,480
were created from a mirrored copy and

73
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,120
that's prettyy much the basics of how

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,400
the mirror symmetry path effect works in

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,319
inkscape so let's have a look at a

76
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,159
working example of when something like

77
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,879
this would be useful the example I'm

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,959
going to use here is creating an emoji

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,959
smiley face so let me grab my circles

80
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,760
and ellipses tool I'm going to click and

81
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
drag on the canvas like that I'm going

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
to hold control and I want to make my

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,159
smiley face yellow I'm going to grab the

84
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,720
selection tool I'm going to duplicate

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
this circle by pressing control D I'll

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
make this copy white and then I'll hold

87
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,000
contr control and shift and I'll scale

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,440
this down like that this circle right

89
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,080
here is actually going to represent a

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,959
smile the bottom half of the circle

91
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,720
anyway it's going to be the smiling uh

92
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,760
face of the uh Emoji here and so in

93
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,319
order to turn this into a smiley I need

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,879
to cut off this bottom part right here

95
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm going to use the rectangle tool to

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,920
do that I'm going to click and drag to

97
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,319
create a rectangle going over that

98
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,360
bottom half like that I'm going to

99
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,680
change this to a different color cuz I'd

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
like to be able to see this rectangle

101
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,640
I'll make this red and I will bring down

102
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,080
the opacity of this as well I'll just

103
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,640
make this something like 50 just so I

104
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,599
can see through it there and if you

105
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,519
notice the intersecting area between the

106
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,599
circle and the red rectangle is going to

107
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,040
represent the smiley face so I'm going

108
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,599
to grab the selection tool hold shift

109
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,280
click on the circle so we have both the

110
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,439
rectangle and the circle selected and go

111
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,599
to path and select intersection and

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,159
there is the smile part of the Emoji now

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,040
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,319
create a single eye up here and then I'm

115
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,000
going to use the mirror symmetry path

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,720
effect to create the other eye for the

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,920
other side so that I can adjust the two

118
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,599
eyes together at the same time so let me

119
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,720
grab the uh circles and ellipses tool

120
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,360
click and drag to create a circle hold

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
control like that let me make this white

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,599
let me bring the opacity of this back up

123
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,319
to

124
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,079
100% grab the selection tool now for

125
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,599
what I want to do the way I want to edit

126
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,079
this I want to convert this circle into

127
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,160
a path so let me go to path and choose

128
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,279
object to path and that's now a path

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
with nodes on it rather than a circle

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,160
object so let me right click this and go

131
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,960
to duplicate I'll make this one black

132
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm going to hold control and shift like

133
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
that scale that down and maybe even move

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,479
that down a little bit like that so what

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,039
I'm going to do is I want to group these

136
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,680
two objects together the White and the

137
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
black circle and I want to group them

138
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,440
together as a single unit so that I can

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,880
mirror both objects at the same time so

140
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm going to hold shift and click on the

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,160
circle with them both selected go to

142
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
object group and now I'm going to mirror

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
the grouped object so I'm going to click

144
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,720
the plus icon down here again our path

145
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,400
effects menu click plus mirror

146
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,479
symmetry and now we have another copy

147
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:00,440
over over there I'm going to grab the

148
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,919
edit paths by nodes tool I'm going to

149
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,960
move this one over I'm going to hold

150
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
control while I'm doing this to make

151
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,000
sure it stays locked on that same

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,639
horizontal axis that the other eye is on

153
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,120
and now what I could do is I could take

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
this object here hold shift take this

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
object here with the nodes tool select

156
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,400
them both I'm going to turn on the

157
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
transformation handles like that and if

158
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,039
I select all of these nodes like that I

159
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,919
can now take these nodes and scale these

160
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,240
eyes up and down like that and as you

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,039
can see whatever change I make to the

162
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,120
one eye is also happening to the other

163
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,520
eye and I can also rotate this around if

164
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,120
i' like as you can see here I'm rotating

165
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,960
the eyes around I can move them over

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
like

167
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,600
this maybe I'll deselect that I'll

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
select just this one right here and I'll

169
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,759
make this one whoops there we go make

170
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,120
this one a little bigger like

171
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,560
that and I'm sure you get the idea

172
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
anything that I do to this grouping of

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
objects will also happen to this

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,960
grouping of objects over here

175
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,479
okay so I'll take this one right here

176
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,560
move this one

177
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,960
over maybe up a little bit turn off the

178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,160
transformation handles when I'm

179
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,479
done and there you go that is how I was

180
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,400
able to use the mirror symmetry tool to

181
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,160
create one eye and create a copy a

182
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,120
symmetry a mirror symmetry copy of the

183
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,639
other eye and I can edit them together

184
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,800
by just editing one of them so that is

185
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
just one example of how you can use the

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
mirror symmetry path effect in inkscape

187
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
if you found this lesson useful then

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
consider checking out my inkscape master

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,840
class it's a collection of over 60

190
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,479
videos where I go over all of the tools

191
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
and features in inkscape and I explain

192
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
what they are and demonstrate how they

193
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
work kind of like how I did in this

194
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,160
video we even have a private Community

195
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,880

196
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,599
