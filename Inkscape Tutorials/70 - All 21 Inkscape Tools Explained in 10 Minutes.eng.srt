00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,400
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,840
in this tutorial I'll be giving you a

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,660
brief overview of all 21 of Inkscape

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,199
stools

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,730
I've even put together a written

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,320
overview that you can use for a quick

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,180
reference anytime you'd like I'll have a

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,470
link to that in the description of the

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,539
video and if you'd like a more in-depth

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,340
explanation of these tools along with

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,380
every other feature in Inkscape be sure

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,119
to check out my Inkscape masterclass

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,859
it's a collection of over 60 videos

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,719
where I go over every tool and feature

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,760
in Inkscape and I explain what it is and

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,140
demonstrate how it works

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,190
I'll have a link to that in the

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,010
description of the video as well let's

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,629
have a look at the Select tool to get us

21
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:43,920
started because this is the tool that

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,230
you'll probably be using most often the

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,180
Select tool as the name suggests allows

24
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,219
you to select individual or multiple

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,860
objects at a time you can also use it to

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,600
make some common transformation to your

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,910
objects like scaling rotating and

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,930
shearing

29
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,910
the Edit paths by nodes tool allows you

30
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,010
to transform the structural properties

31
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,379
of an object by altering the individual

32
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,490
coordinate points of that object

33
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,070
otherwise known as nodes you can

34
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,040
reposition them add new nodes delete

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,619
nodes and even change node type whether

36
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,479
it be a sharp corner or a rounded edge

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,520
the tool also allows you to change the

38
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,560
contours of an object's lines by

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,930
manually moving them or by adjusting the

40
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,700
handles of its nearest node

41
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,950
the squares and rectangles tool is used

42
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,140
to create four-sided vector objects

43
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,090
whether it be a rectangle or a perfectly

44
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,729
symmetrical square by default your

45
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,920
rectangle will have sharp corners but

46
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,720
you can use the little round node at the

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,460
top right to give you a rectangle of

48
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
rounded corners you can easily switch

49
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,330
back to sharp corners anytime you'd like

50
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,759
by clicking the make corners sharp

51
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,180
button in the tool settings menu

52
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,580
the circles and ellipses tool is used to

53
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,680
create vector shapes with curved edges

54
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,720
like ellipses and perfectly round

55
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,060
circles it can also be used to create

56
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,190
partial ellipses by maneuvering this

57
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,320
circular handle at the right edge of the

58
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,720
shape keeping your cursor outside of the

59
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,310
ellipse will allow you to change it by

60
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,679
its radius whereas moving your cursor to

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,510
the inside of the circle will allow you

62
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,030
to change a by its diameter at any point

63
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,980
you can reset the shape back to being an

64
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,410
ellipse in the tool settings menu

65
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,930
the stars and polygons tool is used to

66
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,690
create multi-sided objects it's divided

67
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,880
up into two separate functions one for

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,650
stars and one for polygons

69
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,600
when creating stars you'll be able to

70
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,340
set the number of corners the star has

71
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,680
the spoke ratio between each star and

72
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,930
you can choose to give your star rounded

73
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,400
corners as well if you'd like

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,650
when creating polygons you'll be able to

75
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,450
set the number of sides and corners and

76
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,040
you can choose to make them round it if

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,840
you'd like this can all be done in the

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,490
tool settings menu or by manually

79
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,680
adjusting the handles directly on the

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,670
canvas

81
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,250
the 3d boxes tool allows you to quickly

82
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,800
create three-sided vector boxes that

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,090
appear as if they're three-dimensional

84
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,930
the X Y and z-axis can be adjusted

85
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,420
independently in order to determine the

86
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,330
box's width height and depth the red

87
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,010
lines represent the height of the box

88
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,230
the blue lines represent the width of

89
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,420
the box and the yellow lines represent

90
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,880
the box's depth you can also change the

91
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
perspective of the box by moving the

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,450
nodes associated with the red and yellow

93
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,690
lines

94
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,730
the spirals tool is used to create

95
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,310
vector objects that follow a spiral path

96
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,650
the tool allows you to adjust the number

97
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,230
of turns the spiral has as well as its

98
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,420
divergence from its center point this

99
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,190
can be done either in the tool settings

100
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,190
menu or directly on the canvas

101
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,860
the Bezier pen is used for manually

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,080
drawing your own vector shapes by

103
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,930
creating a series of nodes and lines you

104
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,730
can make both straight and curved lines

105
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,490
as well as sharpen rounded corners the

106
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,320
tool also has a variety of settings

107
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,720
built in including spiral paths and B

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,850
splines each of which determines how the

109
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,340
pen behaves they can be used to force

110
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,750
any behavior you'd like

111
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,060
including curved lines rounded corners

112
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,540
parallel lines and more

113
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,970
the free hand lines tool functions much

114
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,860
like the Bezier pen only it allows you

115
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,420
to draw your shapes with your hands

116
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,010
movement as opposed to clicking to

117
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,139
create a bunch of nodes this would make

118
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,608
it more ideal if you were using a

119
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,470
drawing tablet or some kind of stylus

120
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,108
much like the Bezier pen the freehand

121
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,030
aligns tool has various settings built

122
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,220
in that will dictate the tools behavior

123
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,500
the calligraphy pen allows you to create

124
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,140
freehand vector objects using a classic

125
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,820
brushstroke and shape of your choosing

126
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
the tool has various presets built-in

127
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,100
that will determine the size and shape

128
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,020
of your brushstrokes there's also a

129
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,790
variety of settings that you can tweak

130
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,950
to dictate how the tool will behave

131
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,320
the text objects tool is used to create

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,510
vector text and wording of your choosing

133
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,030
it allows you to flow your text into a

134
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,340
bounding box or simply generate it all

135
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,650
on a single line you can also use the

136
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,810
tool settings to adjust the font size

137
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,450
orientation spacing between letters and

138
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,980
words as well as various other

139
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,640
adjustments

140
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,820
the gradients tool allows you to color

141
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,830
your objects with multiple colors that

142
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,900
fade into each other otherwise known as

143
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,060
gradients the tool allows you to edit

144
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,920
your gradients based on colors used

145
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,500
number of colors and the position of the

146
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,270
color is relative to the object that

147
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,250
it's being applied to the gradients can

148
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,830
follow either a straight linear path or

149
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,850
a rounded radio

150
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,739
the mesh's tool functions similarly to

151
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,449
the gradients tool only it allows you to

152
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,189
give your objects a gradient that

153
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,319
follows either a grid otherwise known as

154
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,599
a mesh gradient or a cone otherwise

155
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,119
known as a conical gradient you can use

156
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,459
the tool to manually alter the points of

157
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,439
your meshes and cones directly on the

158
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,829
canvas

159
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,389
the pick colors from an image tool

160
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,189
commonly referred to as the dropper

161
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,499
allows you to set an object's filling

162
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,930
stroke color based on another object's

163
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,969
color the tool allows you to sample

164
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,039
colors from both vector objects and

165
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,009
rasterized images your selected object

166
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,779
will be filled with whatever color you

167
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,969
sample from the other object you can

168
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,460
also hold shift while sampling to set

169
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,649
the selection as your objects stroke

170
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,080
color you can also click and drag to

171
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,550
create a selection that the tool will

172
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,249
use to generate an average color of the

173
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:23,360
colors in that area

174
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,319
the fill bounded areas tool commonly

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,599
referred to as the bucket tool allows

176
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,400
you to fill empty spaces with the

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
predetermined fill color in order for

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,870
the tool to work the area you're filling

179
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,879
in must be completely surrounded by a

180
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,580
closed path it will not work on empty

181
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,319
spaces that bleed out into the open

182
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,569
canvas the tool will reference whatever

183
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,370
you have set as the fill and Stroke

184
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,930
color for filling in your objects

185
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,410
the tweak objects tool allows you to

186
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,810
make compound alterations to multiple

187
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,130
objects pads and colors all at once

188
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,480
alterations include moving multiple

189
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,090
objects at once shrinking them rotating

190
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,370
them or duplicating them it also allows

191
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,230
you to make adjustments based on colors

192
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,550
and blurs

193
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,860
the spray objects tool allows you to

194
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,020
generate multiple objects by spraying

195
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,539
them onto your canvas the objects that

196
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,060
are sprayed is determined by the object

197
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,460
you have selected at the moment the tool

198
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,050
has a variety of settings that will

199
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,879
allow you to adjust certain behaviors

200
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,099
like whether or not the objects overlap

201
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,710
the size of the scatter area whether or

202
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,569
not to rotate the sprayed objects and

203
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,450
more

204
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,760
the eraser tool is used to delete

205
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,250
segments of a vector path in a freestyle

206
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,050
technique that is based on your hands

207
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,270
movement the tool can work on multiple

208
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,430
objects at a time and it has a variety

209
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,110
of settings built-in that will allow you

210
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,090
to dictate how the tool behaves it

211
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,890
should be noted though that this tool

212
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,170
only work on vector paths it won't work

213
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,389
on text objects and rasterized images

214
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,669
the diagram connectors tool allows you

215
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,370
to create diagrams by generating pads

216
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,259
and boxes that link objects together

217
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,810
much like every other tool it has a

218
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,639
variety of settings built-in that allows

219
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
you to dictate how the tool behaves

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
whether it be avoiding selected objects

221
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,580
or ignoring selected objects

222
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,320
the zoom tool allows you to increase or

223
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,690
decrease your view of the canvas you can

224
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,600
zoom in to see fine details zoom out to

225
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,310
get a more complete view of the canvas

226
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,650
or set the view ratio to one-to-one in

227
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,450
order to see how the canvas looks at

228
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,840
full size

229
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,690
the measurement tool allows you to

230
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,909
measure any object based on its length

231
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,929
width height radius or diameter it

232
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,669
allows you to choose from a variety of

233
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,799
measurement units including pixels

234
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,800
inches centimeters millimeters and more

235
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,260
the tool also has a setting built-in

236
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,399
that allows you to convert your

237
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,649
measurement into an object that you can

238
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,720
work with further and export as a

239
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,960
graphic of its own

240
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,550
and that should do it for all of

241
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,550
Inkscape stools as a version 1.0 if you

242
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,080
