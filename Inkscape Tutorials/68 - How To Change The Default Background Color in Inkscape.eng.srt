00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,059
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:12,680
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,629
how you can make Inkscape have a dark

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,119
workspace on the canvas like illustrator

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,160
has and this is something that I've been

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,020
asked about a lot especially by those of

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,700
you who are switching over to Inkscape

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,280
from Illustrator and find the glaring

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,619
white canvas of Inkscape to be somewhat

11
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,570
of a nuisance when you're working but

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,010
before we get started if you'd like to

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,628
learn more about how Inkscape works be

14
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:33,829
sure to check out my Inkscape

15
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,320
masterclass it's a collection of over 60

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,030
videos where I go over all of the tools

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,130
and features in Inkscape and I explain

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,690
what they are and demonstrate how they

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,040
work I'll have a link in the description

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,329
of the video if you want to check that

21
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,000
out so to get us started here the first

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,140
thing you want to do is just make sure

23
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,670
that you are working with the proper

24
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,860
version of Inkscape which is version 1.0

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,780
or above if you don't know what your

26
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,399
version is just click on help and go to

27
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,010
about Inkscape and it will tell you in

28
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,960
this little pop-up window here as you

29
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,329
can see I am using version 1.0 if you're

30
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,819
using 1.0 or above or greater like a

31
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,229
newer version then you're good to go you

32
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,000
can close out of that if you're using an

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,909
older version like 0.9 2.5 or or

34
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,250
something even older than that you'll

35
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,290
probably have to use one of my older

36
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,460
tutorials because what I'm going to

37
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,350
demonstrate here won't apply to those

38
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,450
older versions so let's close out of

39
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,220
that let's set the dark theme first

40
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,210
let's come over here to where it says

41
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,880
edit and go to preferences and I'm gonna

42
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,560
come over to let me close the Tools menu

43
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,479
let me open up the interface menu and

44
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,780
expand that I'm gonna click on theme I'm

45
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,390
gonna use dark theme check that and then

46
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,299
use symbolic icons and check that and as

47
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,369
you can see here it's already looking a

48
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,590
lot more like illustrator so let's close

49
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,330
out of this menu what we want to do now

50
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,310
is make the workspace have a dark

51
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,380
background here so to do that we'll get

52
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,009
a file document properties and where it

53
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,600
says background color let's open that up

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,180
and I'm going to choose HSL from the

55
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,130
color selector and I'm going to choose

56
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,530
the L row down here and just slide that

57
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,409
up and as you can see it is changing the

58
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,720
background it's changing the canvas

59
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,209
background as I change it there and I'm

60
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,258
going to leave it right about there

61
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,150
that's looking pretty good as you can

62
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,709
see it's already a lot easier on the

63
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,940
eyes it isn't it isn't

64
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,190
you don't have like this bright white

65
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,260
background shining into your eyes so let

66
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,880
me close out of that and close out of

67
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,990
that what we need now is a white like a

68
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,150
white art board to work with to do that

69
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,250
let me grab the squares and rectangles

70
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,440
tool I'm going to create a rectangle and

71
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,290
I'm going to grab the select tool let me

72
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,660
size this rectangle let me set the

73
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,010
increments to pixels I'm going to size

74
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,580
it by 1280 by 1280 if you can size it to

75
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,870
whatever you want I just like to work

76
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,140
with 1280 by 1280 as a default I'm going

77
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,660
to make that white and now I'm going to

78
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,220
open up the document properties again

79
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,170
I'm going to file document properties

80
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,990
and over here we're looking for resized

81
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,380
page to content right there and resize

82
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,210
page to drawing or selection click on

83
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,160
that and it's going to resize the page

84
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,080
boundaries around that rectangle you

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,270
have selected and where it says show

86
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,610
page Bodrum is going to disable that I'd

87
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,860
rather that not be there let's close out

88
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,660
of that and as you can see we now have a

89
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,460
white artboard to work with let me zoom

90
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,530
in on this a little bit but the problem

91
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,880
you'll have now is that you can

92
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,530
accidentally click this thing and alter

93
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,910
it while you're working it'll get your

94
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,620
way so in order to anchor this thing

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,080
down what I'm going to do is use layers

96
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,430
so I'll come over here to the layers

97
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,920
menu let's click on that ctrl shift and

98
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,709
L is the keyboard shortcut and I'm gonna

99
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,570
rename this layer to canvas and I'm

100
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,190
going to lock it I'm going to lock that

101
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,989
layer so that we can't click on it and

102
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,700
edit it while we're working and now I'm

103
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,820
going to add a new layer on top of it

104
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,620
and I'm going to name this content this

105
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,209
is the content layer click Add and there

106
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,300
you go now you have a set up similar to

107
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
illustrator where you have a black or a

108
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,040
dark work space with a white artboard

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,019
then you can export as needed a couple

110
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,220
of things though I'd like to point out

111
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,140
number one is Inkscape does not

112
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,570
recognize this white background as an

113
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,370
actual background it recognizes it as a

114
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,620
white rectangle so if you go to export

115
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,080
an object on top of this background it's

116
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,690
going to export the white rectangle with

117
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,950
it let me show you what I mean here if I

118
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,690
grab the the circles and ellipses tool

119
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,760
and I click and drag to create the

120
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,460
ellipse let me just make that red if I

121
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,810
go to file export PNG image

122
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,780
and I exported by selection it's going

123
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,490
to export everything within this

124
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,370
rectangular bounding box including the

125
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,290
white background there because like I

126
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,480
said Inkscape does not recognize this as

127
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,460
a background it recognizes it as a white

128
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,380
object so normally it would export to

129
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,690
transparency here but now over this

130
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,980
object it's going to export with the

131
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,110
white background to change that you can

132
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,820
just select this option right here that

133
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,700
says hide all except selected and with

134
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,590
that with that selected you can now

135
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,380
export this red ellipse and get a

136
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,330
transparent background in the corners

137
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,370
here if you want to save this as your

138
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,590
startup file so that you don't have to

139
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,240
manually create this every time you want

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,790
to design something just go to file save

141
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,410
template and I'm going to title this

142
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,850
dark canvas and where it says set as

143
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,669
default template go ahead and check that

144
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,690
you know what let me get rid of this

145
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,919
right let me get rid of this ellipse

146
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,320
first and don't want that in there let's

147
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,830
go to file save as no I'm sorry not save

148
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,500
as save template and save this as dark

149
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,590
canvas and set as default template and

150
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,750
go ahead and click Save and what happens

151
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,850
now is you can go ahead and close out of

152
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,520
Inkscape and once you reload Inkscape

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,140
every time you open up Inkscape now you

154
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,419
will get this as your default template

155
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,620
so that you don't have to do this all

156
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,419
the time if you don't feel like setting

157
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,280
this up what I'll do is I will save this

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
document as an SVG file and I will post

159
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,539
a link to it in the description of the

160
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,620
video so if you want you could just

161
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,900
download this file you can open it up

162
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,340
with Inkscape and then just go directly

163
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,910
to file save template and save it as

164
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,000
your default template from there so I

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,050
think that should do it for this

166
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,700
tutorial that is how you can go about

167
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,530
creating a a dark workspace in Inkscape

168
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,030
like you would have an illustrator if

169
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,590
you have any questions leave a comment

170
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,410
below and as always thanks for watching
