1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,959
how you can create a color palette from

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,160
the colors in a pixel-based image using

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,080
inkscape so the first thing you'll want

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,840
to do is import your image onto the

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,679
canvas as I've done here with my example

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,200
image and to sample the colors from this

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
image we're going to use the trace bit

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,600
map tool so I'm going to click on the

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
image to select it and I'll go to path

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
and I will select Trace

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,039
bitmap now the settings I want to go

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
with over here on the right hand side of

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,640
the screen I want to choose the

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,759
multicolor tab and then I want to come

16
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,040
over here to this dropdown and choose

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,239
colors now right here where you see the

18
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,960
number of scans this represents the

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,879
number of colors that will be sampled

20
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,600
from your image and you could see a

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
preview of some of those colors over

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
here in this preview menu now if you

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,960
notice I have eight which is the default

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,840
which you can see it includes a lot of

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,120
the colors there but it misses the

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,160
pinkish reddish color of the Hat here so

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
for my example I'm going to increase

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,199
this number until I get more of those

29
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,920
colors that I want to include

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
and once you're finished all you have to

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
do is click the apply button and give it

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
a second to process if you're using a

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,640
lot of colors like I am in my example

34
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,200
it's going to take a minute or two to

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,520
process okay so the trace is finished

36
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm going to click and drag the trace to

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,960
move it away from the

38
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,040
image and then I'm going to select the

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,720
image and press delete on the keyboard

40
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,880
to get rid of that cuz we don't need

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
that anymore I just want the vector

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,479
colors here and I'm going to ungroup

43
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,520
this so I will go to object and I will

44
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,200
select

45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,079
ungroup and once you've done that you

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,840
can click off of the image to deselect

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,280
everything and you could zoom in to all

48
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,759
of the vector-based elements here to see

49
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,920
the different colors that you could

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
sample so I'm going to start off with

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,520
this pink shade right here I'm going to

52
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,000
click on that to select it and if you

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
notice over here you'll see the color

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,920
highlight in this little stripe down

55
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
here in the bottom left of the screen

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm just going to double click on this

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
stripe and it's going to open up the

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
fill and stroke menu and with this

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
object still selected I want to go to

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,280
the fil Tab and then over here I want to

61
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,520
I want to choose this button right here

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,960
that says Swatch I'm going to click on

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
that and it's going to add that color to

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,720
a new Swatch and now we can go to our

65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,920
swatches menu by going

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,239
to view and selecting

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,959
swatches now you should see your Swatch

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,599
appearing in this list here if you see

69
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,760
other colors populating here just click

70
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,120
on this menu and choose Auto from this

71
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
dropdown so now that we know how to do

72
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,560
that we can go add some more colors to

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
our Swatch here so I'm going to come

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
back over here to the fill and stroke

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
menu I'm going to choose a shade of blue

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
and I'm going to add that to my swatch

77
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,959
as well and if you notice each new

78
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,360
Swatch you add will be indexed in this

79
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,920
menu right here so I'm going to add some

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,319
more and once you're finished once

81
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,080
you're happy with all of your swatches

82
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,640
you can zoom out you can press control a

83
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,280
on your keyboard or command a if you're

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
using Mac to select everything and then

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
just press delete because we don't need

86
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,040
it anymore now now we have our swatches

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,400
in place and if you want to change the

88
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
color menu down here at the bottom of

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
the screen just click on this menu icon

90
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,239
over here down at the bottom right and

91
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,319
instead of inkscape default we want to

92
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,159
choose Auto and once we have Auto

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,280
selected our chosen colors that we

94
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
created from the image will appear in

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
the menu there and if you want to make

96
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,319
those icons bigger you can come back

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,599
over here to the menu and choose

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,319
configure and you could CH take the tile

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
size and increase it like that and now

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,120
you have much bigger swatches to work

101
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,400
with down there in the bottom left

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
corner

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
and now when you create new objects let

104
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,239
me show you as an example you can color

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
you your new objects using these

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,239
swatches down

107
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,840
here so now let's go over how you can

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
save these swatches in case you want to

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
use them in other documents in the

110
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,519
future now there is no way to directly

111
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,400
save these swatches but there is a

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,879
workaround using templates so what you

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
want to do is save this entire document

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
as a template and then it'll be saved

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
with these swatches so that next time

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,439
you open a new document from that

117
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,360
template you will have these in place so

118
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm going to come up here to where it

119
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,840
says file and go

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,879
to save

121
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,720
template and I'm going to give this a

122
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,480
name I'm just going to name this

123
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,519
nature

124
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
pallet and I'll click

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
save and now if I go to file and I

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,400
select new from

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,199
template I can choose the custom tab I'm

128
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,199
going to select nature pallet and click

129
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,000
create from template

130
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,759
and in my new document I can go to view

131
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,520
select swatches and there my color

132
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,440
palette is so that's how you can

133
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,240
generate color palettes from images

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,520
using inkscape if you found this lesson

135
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,120
useful then consider checking out my

136
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,600
inkscape master class it's a collection

137
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
of over 60 videos where I go over all of

138
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,720
the tools and features in inkscape and I

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
explain what they are and demonstrate

140
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,199
how they work kind of like how I did in

141
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,280
this video we even have a private

142
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,880
Community where you can ask questions

143
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,320
and get help from me anytime you want

144
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,039
and best of all there's no monthly

145
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,800
membership fees you just pay $17 one

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,919
time and you're in for Life I'll have

147
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,320
some information about that down below

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
if you want to check that out as always

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,680
