1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,040
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,040
you can create this simple badge style

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,680
logo using inkscape so I'll come over

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,040
here into a new document and get started

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,559
the first thing we want to do is change

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
the size of the canvas so that it is a

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,719
square so I'm going to open up document

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,760
Properties by pressing control shift and

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,039
D on the keyboard if you're a Mac User

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
that would be command shift d and I want

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,680
to change the width and the height so

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
that they're equal so for my example

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,279
here I will use 800 by 800 and then I

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,080
will close out of that and then I want

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,000
to zoom into 100 % so I'm going to press

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,559
one on the keyboard to zoom into 100%

17
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,559
and now I'm going to create a circle to

18
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,200
place in the middle of the canvas here

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,879
which we will wrap the text around so

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,920
I'm going to grab the circles and

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
ellipses tool I'll click and drag to

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
create a circle I'm going to hold the

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,239
control key while I do that so it's nice

24
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,680
and perfectly round and I'll make it

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
about that big relative to the size of

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,879
the canvas and I want to convert this to

27
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,280
a path so I'll come up here to where it

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
says object and I will go to no I'm

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
sorry I'll go to path and I will select

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
object to path and then I want to send

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,480
Center this directly on the canvas so I

32
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,519
will open up the aligned distribute menu

33
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,680
by going to object and selecting aligned

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
distribute and from this drop down over

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
here I want to choose page and now that

36
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,520
we are aligning this relative to the

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
page I want to align this on the

38
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,240
vertical and the horizontal axis we're

39
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,840
selecting the center options there and

40
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,000
now it's perfectly uh centered on the

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,759
canvas like that so now I'm going to

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,040
create some text to put on the circle

43
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,079
let me grab my selection tool first I'm

44
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,520
gon to adjust the size of this a little

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
bit I'm going to hold control and shift

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
and scale this down a little bit because

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
the text is going to be placed up here

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,399
and then down here as well so I want to

49
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,479
leave some room around the edges of the

50
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,040
canvas so that I have enough room for

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,000
that and now I'm going to create the

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,479
text to be placed on the circle here so

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,439
I'll grab the text tool which is located

54
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,439
over here and I will click on the canvas

55
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,960
to create some text I'm going to write

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
for this demonstration I'm just going to

57
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,960
write inkscape for the top line of text

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
we're going to create two different text

59
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
items one for the top line that goes

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,759
along the top of the circle and another

61
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,719
text item that goes along the bottom so

62
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to write inkscape here I'm

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
going to change this font to something

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
else I'm going to go to text and select

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
text and font and from this editor I

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,040
will choose a different font to work

67
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,879
with you can work whatever work with

68
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,120
whatever font you'd like for this uh

69
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,800
design I like the monserat font uh which

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
is a free font if you want to download

71
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
and install that otherwise you can use

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,040
whatever font you'd like and now I want

73
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
to put some spacing between these

74
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
letters so let me come up here to where

75
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
it says spacing

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
and I want to add this I want to add

77
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,920
like three to this value I'll try I'll

78
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,160
start off with three and then we'll take

79
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
it from there and we want to make sure

80
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,400
that this text is centered so come over

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
here to the alignment option and Center

82
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,440
it like that now it's not going to

83
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
visibly change but it's important for

84
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,959
what we're going to do next placing it

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,680
on the circle so let me grab my

86
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
selection tool now I'm just going to

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
bring the text over here to the circle

88
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,840
and just try to eyeball the size of it

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
as it is right now it's going to be

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
wrapped around the top side of this

91
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
circle so you may want to make it a

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
little bigger or smaller depending on

93
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
the size of your circle and I'm holding

94
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,519
in control and shift while I scale like

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,040
this so it scales it evenly from the

96
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,159
center and I'll make my text about that

97
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,720
big and now I will duplicate this I will

98
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,319
right click it and go to

99
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,799
duplicate and I will make this one I'll

100
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,680
make this one the bottom line of text

101
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,920
that I want down here so let me go back

102
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,519
to my text tool and I will change this

103
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,120
one to logo

104
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,239
design and now what we can do is let me

105
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,920
adjust this the spacing between this one

106
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,799
let me just make sure that's equal okay

107
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
this one's a little larger I'm going to

108
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
adjust this I want to make sure that's

109
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
even for both of these I want both of

110
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,400
these to be the same amount of

111
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,360
spacing there we

112
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,120
go and now I'm going to take this text

113
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,319
item right here I'm going to select it

114
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,360
hold shift select the circle and with

115
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,000
them both selected go to text and select

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,879
put on path and now click off of it to

117
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,959
deselect everything and then click on

118
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,159
just the circle click on it again to get

119
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
the rotation handles and then hold your

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,120
control key and grab the rotation handle

121
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,079
in the corner then there and rotate it

122
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,439
around until the text is upright like

123
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,560
that and now I'm going to change the

124
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
color of this so let me make this a

125
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
lighter shade of gray something like

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,599
that so I just so I can see the text a

127
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,879
little better up against the uh the

128
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
canvas there and what I'll do now is I'm

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
going to create another Circle for the

130
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,680
bottom line of text so let me deselect

131
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
that by clicking off of it let me move

132
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,040
this out of the way I'm going to create

133
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,759
another another Circle let me grab my

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,320
circles and ellipses tool click and drag

135
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
to create a circle hold the control key

136
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,479
and I want this circle to be bigger so

137
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,800
I'll make this one bigger and I'll make

138
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
this one A different shade that from the

139
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,880
other Circle I'll make this one maybe a

140
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,759
darker gray and then I'll take this one

141
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,120
I want to lower this to the bottom so

142
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
I'll click this button right here that

143
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,440
says lower to the bottom and I'm going

144
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
to Center this on the page as well so

145
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,000
let me come back over here to my

146
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
alignment menu and I will Center this

147
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680
vertically and horizontally and now I'm

148
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
going to scale down this circle I'm

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
going to grab this Arrow right here and

150
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,039
hold control and shift and scale it down

151
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,800
until the top of the circle touches the

152
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,400
top of that line of text right there and

153
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,919
now I'm going to convert this to a path

154
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,880
by going to path and selecting object to

155
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,280
path and now I'm going to grab my text

156
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,600
item right here and I'll do the same

157
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
thing that I did previously I'm going to

158
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,759
hold shift I'm going to click on the

159
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,960
larger Circle this time and go to text

160
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
and SE select put on

161
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,479
path click off of it to deselect select

162
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,199
just the large Circle click on it again

163
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,919
to get the rotation handles and rotate

164
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,000
this around while holding control until

165
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,039
it's

166
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,600
upright and now we just want to flip the

167
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,160
circle so I'm going to come over here to

168
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,000
where it says flip vertical and click on

169
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,240
that and now we have the text down there

170
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,199
like that so what we can do at this

171
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
point is we can adjust the circles to

172
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,000
make sure that this text fills up as

173
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,880
much area as we want it to fill up so if

174
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
you notice right now there's a lot of

175
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,759
empty space on this side of the circle

176
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,199
on both sides between the two text items

177
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,600
let's say you want to close that in a

178
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
bit I'm going to select both circles you

179
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
can do that by holding shift and

180
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
clicking on each and then I'm going to

181
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
hold control and shift and scale them

182
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
down like like this and if you notice

183
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
you can decrease the space between the

184
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,199
words or you can increase the space

185
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,840
between the words whatever works best

186
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,960
for your uh however you have things

187
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,000
arranged right now I want to leave some

188
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,160
space in there because we're going to

189
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
put we're going to be putting these uh

190
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,919
these little tails on the end here so

191
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,039
I'm going to leave a little bit of space

192
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,840
for that and I'm going to leave that

193
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
just as it is and now I'm just going to

194
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,880
adjust my circles to make up for the uh

195
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,039
Missing space there because if you

196
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,000
notice this is uh the larger Circle here

197
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,520
is no longer aligned with the other text

198
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,080
there we go

199
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,319
and that looks a little better and I'm

200
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,039
going to increase the spacing between

201
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,520
these letters down here because these

202
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
letters look a little closer together

203
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,039
than these ones do just because of the

204
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,560
Contour of the circle that's just how it

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
works so let me grab my text tool let me

206
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,919
select all of the text I'll come over

207
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,520
here to my spacing and I'll put a little

208
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
more spacing in there maybe for this one

209
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,759
I'll try five and that looks a lot

210
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,000
better so what we're going to do now

211
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,039
once you're happy with your text and the

212
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,360
placing and the spacing between

213
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
everything Click on each of these

214
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
circles and let's turn off the fill

215
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
color Al together so select it and then

216
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,400
come over here to this red X and click

217
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
on that and I'll do the same thing I'll

218
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,160
come over here to this circle and click

219
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,960
on the Red X over here now from this

220
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,680
point forward it's important to remember

221
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,599
that this these text items are linked to

222
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,000
the invisible circles that they're

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,639
placed on so try not to click or drag

224
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,319
any of these text items out of the way

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,400
otherwise you're going to mess up the

226
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,280
balance of everything and if at any

227
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,599
point you need to go back to those

228
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,120
circles and adjust things if you notice

229
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
you can't click on those circles now

230
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
because they're invisible you can get to

231
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
them by going to view and going to

232
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,879
display mode and selecting outline and

233
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,479
once you can see the outlines then you

234
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
can click on them and select them that's

235
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
just in case you need to go back and

236
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
edit this at all though so I'm happy

237
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,800
with how it is so I'm going to go back

238
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,319
to my regular display mode I'll go to

239
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,319
view I'll go to display mode and select

240
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,599
normal and now I'm going to create these

241
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,520
Rings going around either side of the

242
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
text here so let me come back in here

243
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm going to go back to my circles and

244
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,120
ellipses

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
tool click and drag to create a circle

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,639
ircle I'm going to hold control so we

247
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,639
have a perfectly round circle and I want

248
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,680
to get rid of the fill color and I want

249
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,400
to add a black stroke so I'm going to

250
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,599
hold shift and click on the black color

251
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,879
over here and then I will grab my

252
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,520
selection tool and I will Center this on

253
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,599
the page as well and now I just want to

254
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,440
scale this down so that it encompasses

255
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
the text there like that and what I'm

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,919
going to do now is I'm going to come up

257
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,000
here to this option where it says when

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,560
scaling objects scale the stroke width

259
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,319
by the same proportion make sure you

260
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,599
have that deselected if you have it in

261
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,879
right now go ahead and disable that and

262
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,519
now I'll come over here to my well

263
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,559
actually I want to open the fill and

264
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,880
stroke menu so I'll come up here to

265
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
where it says object and go to fill in

266
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,799
stroke and I want to click on the stroke

267
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,919
style Tab and I want to change the size

268
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,880
or the weight of this stroke so that

269
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
it's kind of consistent with the text

270
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
there it already looks like a pretty

271
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
good size as it is but maybe a little

272
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
smaller it would look better so I'm

273
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
going to try eight and see how that

274
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
looks maybe

275
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,640
nine okay nine looks good so I'll leave

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,320
that as it is and now I'm going to right

277
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,200
click this and go to duplicate and then

278
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,040
I'll hold control and shift and scale

279
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,760
this down so that we have this ring on

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,360
the inside here and if you notice as I

281
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,320
scale this down the stroke weight stays

282
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,040
the same size that's why we disabled

283
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,959
that option up there so let me make this

284
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,320
a little bigger what I'm looking at here

285
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
is the spacing between the bottom and

286
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,240
the top here we want to make sure

287
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,760
there's about an equal amount of padding

288
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,440
between each of between each of those

289
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
there we go that looks pretty good let

290
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
me zoom out and now what I'm going to do

291
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
is I'm going to create this little uh

292
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
this little side ring that you see going

293
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
along the side here so let me zoom out

294
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
let me come back over here and I'm going

295
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
to duplicate this again I'm going to

296
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,720
right click it and go to duplicate and

297
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,519
hold control and shift and scale this

298
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
down so that it's going about halfway

299
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,000
through these other two rings right here

300
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,720
and that's looking good okay so now I

301
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
just want to keep these portions of the

302
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,880
Ring I want to clip off the parts where

303
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
they're going through the text so let me

304
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,920
grab my rectangle tool and let me click

305
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
and drag to draw a rectangle going

306
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
through the area of that ring that I'd

307
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
like to keep let me change the color of

308
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
this let me bring down its opacity so I

309
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
can see through it and I'll come over

310
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,200
here to my selection tool and I'm just

311
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
going to adjust this if you notice the

312
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,959
top of the rectangle is going right here

313
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,399
where that text begins and I want the

314
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,600
same thing down here about the same

315
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,720
about the same

316
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,000
amount and once you do that you can hold

317
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,560
shift and click on the ring so you have

318
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,519
both the ring and the rectangle selected

319
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,680
and go to path and select

320
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
cut path and then click off of it to

321
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,720
deselect everything and now you could

322
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,839
take the top half of this ring press

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,240
delete to get rid of it and the same

324
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
thing down here click on that press

325
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
delete to get rid of it and if you

326
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,600
notice my Strokes right here have

327
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
rounded caps on the end of them if yours

328
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,680
are squared and you want to make them

329
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
rounded like mine just come over here

330
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,920
into the stroke style Tab and you can

331
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,200
see the cap setting by default is set to

332
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,279
rounded if I make it Square we get that

333
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,440
effect right there but I like how it

334
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,680
looks better rounded so I'm going to put

335
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
that back to

336
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
rounded and now we're going to create

337
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
these little ribbons on the end here or

338
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
these little Tails whatever you want to

339
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,519
call them so let me come back in here

340
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,320
and try to remember what this value is

341
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,079
the size of your stroke the size of the

342
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,560
stroke should be the same for the entire

343
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,440
design so I'm working with a nine pixel

344
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,839
stroke for my design so I want to make

345
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,320
sure that everything that I create from

346
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,680
here on out also has a nine pixel stroke

347
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
so let me grab my rectangle tool I'm

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
going to click and drag over this area

349
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,279
of the circle where I want that Banner

350
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,800
to

351
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,320
be and I'm going to convert this to a

352
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
path I will go to path and select object

353
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
to

354
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,480
path I'll grab my selection tool I'll

355
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,560
come back over here to my alignment menu

356
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
and I want to make sure that this is

357
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
aligned vertically and horizontally as

358
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,079
well and I'll make this one maybe a

359
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,639
little

360
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,839
smaller there we go let me adjust the

361
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,880
alignment I'm going to remove the fill

362
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
color I'm going to hold shift and click

363
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
on the color black to add that stroke on

364
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,880
there and again I want this stroke to be

365
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,399
the same weight as the other Strokes I

366
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,920
can already tell that this is larger so

367
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,160
let me come back over here to my fill

368
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,200
and stroke menu and I'm going to change

369
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,240
this back to

370
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
nine and now we're going to put little

371
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
indents on the ends here so let me grab

372
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
my nodes tool I'll click and drag over

373
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,360
these two nodes and I'll click this

374
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,600
button up here that says insert new

375
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,440
nodes into selected

376
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,279
segments and that's going to put a new

377
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,000
node in there and I'll do the same thing

378
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
over here I'll select these two and I

379
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
will add a new node in there and now I

380
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
just want to click and drag over those

381
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
two middle nodes that I just have those

382
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
two Center nodes selected and I will

383
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,079
enable this option up here in the tool

384
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,639
settings menu that says show

385
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,320
transformation handles for selected

386
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,399
nodes and when I click on that you can

387
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,000
see we now have these transformation

388
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,199
handles I'm going to click and drag on

389
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,560
this Arrow I'm going to hold control and

390
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
shift and scale this in like that so

391
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,519
that it scales from both sides and we

392
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,160
end up with that sort of effect right

393
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
there and now I will disable this

394
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,279
setting and go back to my selection

395
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,639
tool and I'm just going to adjust the

396
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,720
height of this I'm going to make this a

397
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
little smaller height-wise because I

398
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,040
notice not much of this part of the

399
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,399
design is sticking out there and I'd

400
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,000
like to see more of that so I'm going to

401
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,120
adjust this height accordingly and I

402
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,839
will Center that and now we just got to

403
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,440
clip out these areas from here if you

404
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,360
notice we removed all of these unwanted

405
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,279
areas so let's go back and do all of

406
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,600
that uh what I'm going to do is first

407
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm going to select I'm going to select

408
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
these the smaller ring in the center in

409
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
the center here I will right click that

410
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,040
and go to duplicate and then hold shift

411
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
and click on that rectangle and go to

412
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,760
path and

413
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
select cut

414
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,519
path and now we can click off of it to

415
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,320
deselect and we can just get rid of

416
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
these pieces on the inside here and now

417
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm going to come over here I'm going to

418
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,040
select this object right click go to

419
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,800
duplicate hold shift click on this path

420
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
right here and go to path and select cut

421
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
path and then I can get rid of

422
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
that and then one more time I will do

423
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,199
the same thing to the larger ring now so

424
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,959
I'll take this object right click it go

425
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,320
to duplicate

426
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,839
hold shift click on the larger ring go

427
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
to path and select cut path and now I

428
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
can get rid of this as well now if you

429
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,079
notice over here this stroke is sticking

430
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,519
out you could barely see it but there's

431
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,880
a tiny little bump sticking out there uh

432
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
you can adjust that by grabbing your

433
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,959
nodes tool and selecting it and then

434
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,079
just moving it over a little bit I'm

435
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,560
going to hold control while I do that to

436
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,839
make sure it does not leave the

437
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,920
horizontal axis and then I'll just move

438
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,839
it in a little bit there we go that

439
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,360
looks better and I'll do the same thing

440
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,000
over here I'll click on this node and

441
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,639
then just hold control and move that in

442
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,399
like that and now I'm going to repeat

443
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,639
this process over here on this side so

444
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,360
let me go back to my selection tool make

445
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
a duplicate of this one instead of right

446
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
clicking and going to duplicate you can

447
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
just press contrl D on your keyboard or

448
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
command D if you're using Mac to

449
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,880
duplicate it hold shift click on this

450
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,440
stroke go to path and select cut path

451
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,519
get rid of that piece right there and I

452
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,959
will do the same thing one more time I'm

453
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,160
going to duplicate that hold shift click

454
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,279
on the circle and we will cut the path

455
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,360
and get rid of that and there we go so

456
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
now I'm going to press one of the

457
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,560
keyboard to zoom out to

458
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,399
100% And if you notice the way I created

459
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,920
this these ribbons are sticking out from

460
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,759
the circle a little too far from my

461
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,720
liking so if you want to adjust this

462
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,279
just go to your nodes tool and select

463
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,160
the object and just select these nodes

464
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,680
right here let me try that

465
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,800
again there we go now you can use your

466
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,440
left and right arrow keys to move this

467
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,839
in so I'm going to move this in one two

468
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,959
three and I'll come over here just for

469
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,399
the sake of symmetry you want to do the

470
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,680
same thing over here I'm going to select

471
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,240
these ones and move them in three steps

472
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
as well so one two three and I'm just

473
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,519
pressing my arrow keys to do

474
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,199
that so now I will create some text to

475
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
place in here if you notice on this

476
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,279
design I just placed the year in there

477
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,279
2023 I'll just write that I'll just

478
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,399
write the same thing in there for the

479
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,759
sake of this tutorial obviously you

480
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,079
would want to write whatever you want in

481
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,920
there so I'm going to write

482
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,079
20 let me change the text style of that

483
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,639
let me find my original font that I was

484
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,600
working with

485
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
there we go and let me bring this in

486
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,519
here like

487
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,040
that scale that down a little bit so it

488
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,920
fits select both we want to select both

489
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,839
objects there go to the alignment menu

490
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,120
and now we're going to change the

491
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,839
relative to last selected and then

492
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,600
Center that on the horizontal axis and

493
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
then I'll duplicate this I'll press

494
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
command D or control D and then just

495
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
bring this over here again holding the

496
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,920
control key while I slide this over so

497
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,199
it stays on that horizontal plane and I

498
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,440
will change this one to

499
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,800
23 I'll just move that over a little bit

500
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,800
more and if you notice over here thing

501
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,319
this part of the stroke is sticking out

502
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:41,720
a little bit as well so let me grab my

503
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,880
nodes tool and just make a quick little

504
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,839
adjustment

505
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,399
there there we go and this side looks

506
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,560
good although there's a tiny bit

507
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
sticking out there let me select just

508
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
that node and bring that out there we go

509
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,040
that looks

510
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
better and now what we want to do is the

511
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,040
design itself is is finished but if you

512
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,440
want to color everything in and stylize

513
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,280
it we're going to have to make a few

514
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,359
adjustments here so the first thing I

515
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,480
want to do is select all of the items

516
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
that are Strokes so I'm going to hold

517
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,679
shift and click on each of these Rings

518
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
remember you got to you got to select

519
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,599
the top and the bottom half of the Ring

520
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,439
because those are broken up now and I

521
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,720
want to select these pieces down here

522
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,119
and this piece over here as well I'll

523
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,679
select these pieces we're basically

524
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,720
selecting everything except for the text

525
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
items and with them all selected we want

526
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
to merge them all together or com Bine

527
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,640
them rather we'll go to path and we will

528
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
select uh we're looking for combine

529
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,160
right here and once they're combined you

530
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,880
can change the stroke color so let me

531
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
come over here to my fill in stroke tab

532
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll go to the stroke paint Tab and we

533
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,520
can make this a different color I'm

534
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,559
going to make

535
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,360
this a dark shade of blue like I did in

536
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,400
the

537
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
thumbnail and now I'm going to make the

538
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,799
text the same color so I'm going to

539
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
select the text items I'm holding shift

540
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,880
while I do this and I want to go to my

541
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,000
dropper which is over here and I will

542
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,880
just sample a selection of this blue

543
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,000
right there and now that's the same

544
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,760
color let me go to the circles and

545
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,880
ellipses tool and click and drag to

546
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,159
create a circle and I will make this one

547
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,480
a different color I'll make this I'm

548
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,000
going to use the colors that I used over

549
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,320
here for this thumbnail I'll make this

550
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,080
part yellow this part blue and this part

551
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,200
A light shade of red so I'll come back

552
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,919
in here grab my selection tool I'll make

553
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,400
this one a lighter shade of yellow I'll

554
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
send this to the

555
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,799
back and come back over here to my

556
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,000
aligned distribute menu set this back to

557
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
page and now I want to Center this on

558
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
the page and I will just scale this up a

559
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,440
little bit I'm going to hold control and

560
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,320
shift while I'm scaling that up and we

561
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,120
want this to fill in the circle but we

562
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,520
don't want it to extend beyond the

563
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,240
circle so we want it placed within the

564
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,679
boundary of that stroke there and then I

565
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,960
will duplicate this I'll press control D

566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,400
to duplicate it and I'll make this one a

567
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,880
lighter shade of blue let me just adjust

568
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,280
that color a little bit so we have a

569
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,559
different

570
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,799
shade and I'll lower this one down a few

571
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,559
steps oh we don't want it that far let

572
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,039
me raise it one more we want it to be

573
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,760
above the yellow one and then I'll just

574
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
hold control and shift and scale this

575
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,039
down so that it's in there now and then

576
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,799
finally all we have to do now is fill in

577
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,120
these areas so to do this I'm just going

578
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,320
to grab my my pen tool which is located

579
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,039
over here or you could press B on the

580
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,799
keyboard to access it and make sure you

581
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,200
have the correct setting here we want

582
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,159
this setting right here and I'm just

583
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,760
going to click to create points going

584
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
through here

585
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,240
and draw a shape that matches the shape

586
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,880
of this object here and let me make that

587
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,480
a lighter shade of red like that I'm

588
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,919
going to remove The Stroke by holding

589
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,240
shift and clicking the X grab the

590
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,000
selection tool and I will lower this a

591
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,600
few steps until it's beneath everything

592
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
there we go looking good and now I'm

593
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,760
just going to instead of drawing another

594
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,799
shape over here I'm just going to

595
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,600
duplicate this and flip it so I'll press

596
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,799
controll D I will flip it on the

597
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,240
horizontal axis and then just bring this

598
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,039
over here and I will lower this down as

599
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,320
well and now at this point you can you

600
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,520
can import your own graphic or your own

601
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
icon or whatever you want to put in

602
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,440
there uh for this this demonstration I

603
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,960
just used the inkscape logo I'm not

604
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,320
going to go through that and do that

605
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,799
again it's already there but you get the

606
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,640
idea you can now put whatever you want

607
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
in there and once you're finished uh and

608
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
you're happy with everything you can

609
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,480
either save this design as it is right

610
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,280
now or you can select the text if you

611
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,440
select the text and go to path object to

612
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,720
path you can now edit the design so let

613
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,480
me go and convert this to object to path

614
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
and now I can select everything and I

615
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
can move it around and resize it if I

616
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
want if you try moving moving it around

617
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
and resizing it before converting that

618
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,679
text to a path then you're going to lose

619
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,039
the text on the path it's not going to

620
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,400
be wrapped around that Circle anymore uh

621
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
but the downside is is once you do that

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,679
now you can't edit the text anymore so

623
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,200
make sure you don't do that until you're

624
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,919
completely happy with how the text looks

625
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,880
and let's say for example you want to

626
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
scale this up a little bit I'm going to

627
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,000
hold control I'm going to scale this up

628
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
it's going to make those Strokes look a

629
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,120
little

630
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,279
smaller because the weight of them is

631
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,520
fixed relative to the size and once

632
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,720
you're happy with that as well you can

633
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,159
turn this setting back on that says uh

634
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
scaling objects scale the stroke width

635
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
by the same proportion and I'll just

636
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,559
group everything together I will go to

637
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,720
object and select group and there you go

638
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,559
now you can scale this and edit it

639
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,559
however you want now you have a simple

640
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,279
logo that you can work with so that's

641
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,919
how you can go about creating that logo

642
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,799
with inkscape if you have any questions

643
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,520
