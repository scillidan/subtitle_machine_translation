00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
this is nick with logos by nick.com and

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
in this tutorial i'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,360
how you can use

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,839
inkscape for desktop publishing purposes

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,520
to create things like reports

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
manuals ebooks and various other types

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
of pdf documents

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
now granted inkscape probably isn't the

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
best tool for this sort of thing

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
but if you just need to create a simple

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,560
one or two page document

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
or maybe even a short ebook and you're

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
already somewhat familiar with inkscape

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
then it would probably be more practical

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
than taking the time to learn

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,399
an entirely new piece of software like

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
scribus or indesign

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
i've used inkscape myself to create

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
manuals and ebooks in the past so i know

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
that it's perfectly capable in that

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,480
regard

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,760
before we get started though if you'd

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
like to learn everything that there is

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
to know about inkscape

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
be sure to check out my inkscape master

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
class it's a collection of over 60

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,039
videos where i go over

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
every tool and feature in inkscape and i

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,879
explain what it is and demonstrate how

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,520
it works

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
i'll have a link in the description of

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
the video if you want to check that out

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
so to get us started here in inkscape

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,360
i'm going to open up a new document and

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
then set up the documents that we are

37
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
all working with a similar workflow

38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,320
come up here to where it says view make

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
sure we have custom selected

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
and then come up to zoom and go to zoom

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
in at one to one

42
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,360
and then we'll open up the align and

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,799
distribute menu with this button right

44
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,600
here

45
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
and then open up the fill and stroke

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,159
menu with this button right here

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,400
and over here where it says snapping we

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,600
want to make sure we have enable

49
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,119
snapping enabled

50
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,640
and we want this one enabled right here

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
that says snap nodes

52
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,159
pads and handles we also want this one

53
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
enabled that says snap to cusp nodes

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,520
including rectangle corners

55
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
and the one next to it as well snap to

56
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
smoothnose we're going to enable that

57
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
and then over here where it says snap

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
text anchors and baselines

59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
enable that and then finally over here

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
where it says snap to the page border

61
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,640
enable that as well

62
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
and also you're going to want to make

63
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,759
sure you have snap guides enabled as

64
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,000
well

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,439
but that should be enabled by default

66
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
but if it's not go ahead and enable that

67
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,880
so what i want to do now is set up the

68
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,560
canvas so that it's suitable for

69
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,360
creating these

70
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
pdf documents we're going to create so

71
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,000
we'll come over here to where it says

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,799
file

73
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,840
click on document properties

74
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
then where it says display units i want

75
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,239
to change that to inches

76
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,319
and over here where it says page size we

77
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
have a list of templates here i'm going

78
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
to choose us

79
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,520
letter which is 8.5 by 11 inches if you

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
want to create something like an a5 or

81
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,440
an a1 or maybe even us legal you can use

82
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,879
that if you want for this tutorial i'm

83
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
just going to do the standard 8.5 by 11

84
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,599
inches

85
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,959
over here where it says border we want

86
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
to leave show page border enabled

87
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
border on top of drawing we're going to

88
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,400
enable that that should be helpful when

89
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
we're creating our design

90
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
and then show border shadow let's just

91
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,879
disable that

92
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
and then finally over here where it says

93
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
background color i'm going to change

94
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,200
this

95
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
i'm going to click on the hsl tab and

96
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
i'm going to come down here to the l row

97
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
and slide this to the left a little bit

98
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,879
if you notice the canvas

99
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
is becoming darker as i do that and we

100
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
want the canvas to be slightly darker

101
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
than white because

102
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
white is going to be the color of the

103
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
page we create here

104
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
so let me close out of that we should be

105
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
all set now close out of that

106
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
what i want to do now is create a

107
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
rectangle to place in this page border

108
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,040
here is going to represent the white

109
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
page of the document so i'll grab the

110
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,959
squares and rectangles tool

111
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
and i'll snap to the top left corner of

112
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
the page click and drag and then snap to

113
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,319
the bottom right corner of the page to

114
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
create this rectangle there

115
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,720
and i want to make this rectangle white

116
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,319
make sure your opacity is all the way up

117
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
at 100

118
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,959
and make sure you don't have an outline

119
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,640
around your object otherwise known as a

120
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
stroke if you do have a stroke added to

121
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,519
your object just hold

122
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
shift and click this red x down here to

123
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
get rid of it

124
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
and then finally up here where it says

125
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
make shoulders make corners sharp we

126
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
want to make sure we have sharp corners

127
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
while we're doing this so if this is not

128
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
grayed out go ahead and click on that

129
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
we don't want our page to have rounded

130
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,560
corners

131
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
okay so now that we have our page set we

132
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,319
need to define the content

133
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
area of this page we don't want the

134
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
content to run all the way to the edges

135
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
here so we want to create one inch of

136
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
padding going around the document here

137
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
so to do that let me grab the select

138
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,159
tool let me right click on this

139
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
dot this rectangle here and go to

140
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
duplicate and i'm just going to make

141
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
this red so we can differentiate it this

142
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
is just temporarily

143
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
and up here where it says width and

144
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
height or w and h

145
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
we're going to remove an inch from each

146
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,040
dimension so it's going to be 7.5 by 11.

147
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
before we do this though make sure you

148
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
don't have this lock icon enabled make

149
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
sure it's disabled like i have it here

150
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
so i'm going to change this to 7.5

151
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,440
i'm going to hit tab to skip over to the

152
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
height and change that to 10

153
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
and then press enter and it should now

154
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
be an inch smaller now what we have to

155
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,080
do is center this

156
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
up on the page so where it says relative

157
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
to change this to page over here in the

158
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
align distribute menu

159
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
and we're looking for center on vertical

160
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,800
axis and center on horizontal axis

161
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
and this right here is going to define

162
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
where the contents of the page

163
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
are we don't want to leave this red

164
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
object sitting here though so we're

165
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
going to convert this to guides

166
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
come up here to where it says object and

167
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
go to

168
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
convert objects to guides and now we

169
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
have guides there to reference as we're

170
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,000
creating our design

171
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
so the first thing we're going to do to

172
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
create the design that i showed you in

173
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
the beginning of the video is we're

174
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,880
going to create some

175
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
header text or title text up here let me

176
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,919
grab the

177
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,639
text tool let me click and drag actually

178
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
i'm going to snap to the corner of these

179
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
these guides over here and then just

180
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
click and drag to create a title area

181
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
i'm just going to title this monthly

182
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
report

183
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
and i'm going to change this make this

184
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
bold

185
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
maybe make this a smaller size go with

186
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,360
something like 20

187
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
and if you want to change the font you

188
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,840
can do so over here i'm going to leave

189
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
the default sans font

190
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
for now leave that now i want to put a

191
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,560
page

192
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
number over here so let me just

193
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,759
duplicate this text object i'll right

194
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,120
click it go to duplicate

195
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
and i'll change this let me grab the

196
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
text tool change this to zero

197
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,919
one because this will be page one and

198
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,880
let me uh

199
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
let me make this a little smaller first

200
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,160
of all i wanna remove the bold i'm gonna

201
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
make this normal

202
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
and then i'll just make this maybe

203
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
something like 16

204
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,639
that looks pretty good and now we can

205
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
just place this in the top right corner

206
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
over here

207
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,960
i'm going to zoom in on this to zoom in

208
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,319
i'm just holding ctrl and rolling up the

209
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
mouse wheel to move the page just press

210
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
down the mouse wheel and move the mouse

211
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
i just want to manually place this in

212
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
the corner here unfortunately these text

213
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
objects will not snap into

214
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
your guides unless it's the base of the

215
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
text object like you see here but

216
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
that's not what we're looking for so

217
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,600
we're going to leave that right there as

218
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
it is let me zoom back out

219
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
and now i just want to create like a

220
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
little divider to put right here so i'm

221
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
going to grab the rectangle tool again

222
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
click and drag to create like a little

223
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
rectangle going from one side to the

224
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
other

225
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,360
that's looking pretty good i'll make

226
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
this something like yellow

227
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
grab the select tool move this up like

228
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
that

229
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,440
let me zoom in so i can get a little

230
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
closer there we go that's what i'm

231
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,319
looking for

232
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,240
and i want to make a copy of this

233
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
divider and put it at the bottom of the

234
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,960
page too so let me right click this and

235
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
go to duplicate

236
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,759
and i will put this divider at the

237
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,039
bottom of the page where the bottom of

238
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,639
the margin is

239
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
and now i want to create some content

240
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,000
area for our design here

241
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
what i'm going to do for this particular

242
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,199
design i'm going to create two columns

243
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,240
of text

244
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
if you want you could just use one giant

245
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
block of text i'm going to put a little

246
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
more design into this so i'm going to

247
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,479
use two columns of text here so

248
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
let me grab the rectangle tool again let

249
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
me create another rectangle going

250
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
through the uh

251
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
through the uh guidelines here and let

252
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,120
me just make this red let me bring down

253
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
the opacity

254
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
and i want to divide this up into two

255
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
separate evenly sized and evenly spaced

256
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,240
apart

257
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,520
rectangle so to do that i'm going to

258
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
create another rectangle going through

259
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,759
the center here

260
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
like this and i'm going to center that

261
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
up on the page

262
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,800
grab the select tool hold shift

263
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
click on the object there and go to path

264
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,039
difference so those are now two

265
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,720
different objects and i'm just going to

266
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
zoom in i'm going to hold ctrl roll up

267
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
the mouse wheel to zoom in a little bit

268
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
position this down here a little further

269
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,199
we don't want this

270
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,639
we don't want this flush against the

271
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
guide here because the text is going to

272
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
be in this red area we don't want the

273
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
text to be stacked on top of this

274
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,840
divider so

275
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
a little bit of padding in there should

276
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,960
help something like that looks pretty

277
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,440
good

278
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
and i don't want these text columns to

279
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
be this high so i'm just going to take

280
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,080
this top arrow and just bring this down

281
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
i'm going to leave these two text

282
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
columns right

283
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
here and i'm going to put some other

284
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
contents up here

285
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
which we will go over momentarily so let

286
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,479
me zoom in

287
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
let's break this apart into two separate

288
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
objects we'll go to path

289
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,879
break apart and now we'll go to

290
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
objects object to guides

291
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,319
and we now just created guides that we

292
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
can reference for placing our text

293
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
so let's go ahead and place some

294
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
placeholder text in here i'm just going

295
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,800
to copy and paste

296
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
some lorem ipsum dummy text

297
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
and let me grab the text tool over here

298
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
click and drag this corner

299
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
down to here like that i'm just going to

300
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,120
hit ctrl

301
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
v to paste my text in there now this is

302
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,880
a little too big let me

303
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
let me select all of this and ctrl a to

304
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
select all

305
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
i want to bring the size down to like

306
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
maybe 12.

307
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
i'm just going to go ahead and add some

308
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
more text in here now let me just copy

309
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
and paste more of this alarm if some

310
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
text now if you notice

311
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
if you if your text is too long it's

312
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
going to run to the end of the page here

313
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
so let me take this little node and just

314
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
drag this down

315
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
and as you can see the text is running

316
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
through the edge here so if

317
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
your text is bleeding out to the edge

318
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
just go ahead and select it and delete

319
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,120
it

320
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
and you'll have to continue it on in

321
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,399
this column over here this is one of the

322
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
reasons why i think inkscape probably

323
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,279
isn't the best tool for this sort of

324
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,080
thing because

325
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,399
you got to do a lot of manual copy and

326
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
pasting with the text

327
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
if you want if you notice the text here

328
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
we have this spacing on the right side

329
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
if you want to make it so that the text

330
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
runs to the to the edges of both sides

331
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
uh what you can do is you can come up to

332
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
the uh justification up here

333
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
the alignment rather and then change to

334
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,880
change it to this option right here and

335
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
if you notice it spaces the text out so

336
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
it runs to the edges like that

337
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,839
i don't like how that looks personally

338
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
it looks too like robotic so i'm just

339
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,240
gonna

340
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
leave it as it was before and then we're

341
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,519
gonna do the same thing over here create

342
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,279
some more text i'm gonna make this box

343
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
even bigger this time so i don't have to

344
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,320
change the size of it and again we're

345
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
just gonna uh

346
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
i'm just gonna control paste use this

347
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,920
dummy text here

348
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
let me select all control a to select

349
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
all change the size of this to match the

350
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
size of the other text i'm gonna use 12.

351
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
and for this one i'm going to maybe

352
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
shorten this

353
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,600
by about this much because for this

354
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
design i'm going to use

355
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,480
like a placeholder graphic over here

356
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
like a chart or some kind of

357
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
pie chart or something like that go back

358
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
to the select tool

359
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
okay so now that part is done what we

360
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,800
could do now is create like a text area

361
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
in here like a like a header section

362
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
to do that i'm going to grab the white

363
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
rectangle that represents the page

364
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,839
i'm going to right click that and go to

365
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
duplicate and i'm just going to take

366
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
this bottom arrow and scale it up like

367
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,680
this

368
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
bring it up to about there let me change

369
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,800
the color of this so we can see what

370
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
we're doing here i'm going to make this

371
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,040
like a dark shade of blue like that

372
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
you can use whatever color you like i'll

373
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
take this top arrow bring this down

374
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
and we're going to use this area right

375
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
here to add some like uh

376
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
leader text or header text and before i

377
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,720
do that though i just want to make sure

378
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
that this is evenly spaced out between

379
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
this text object

380
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
this blue rectangle and this yellow

381
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,680
divider i want to make sure all three of

382
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
these are evenly spaced out so i'm going

383
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,959
where it says distribute

388
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,240
and we're looking for this icon down

389
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
here towards the bottom right that says

390
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440

go ahead and click on that

392
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160

i'm going to make that white

399
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,279
and maybe i'll make that a little bigger

400
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,920
maybe something like 30 32 that should

401
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
be pretty good

402
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880

i'm going to zoom in so that the snaps

417
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,560
won't get in the way there we go

text can go here

425
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
let me just stack this next to it like

426
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600

429
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
evenly spaced apart looking pretty good

430
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
now i'm going to put some text in here

431
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
on this right side to do that

432
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,880
let me grab the text tool i'm going to

433
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
start over here on this guideline

434
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,839
click and drag like this let me try that

435
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,880
again i'm going to click and drag to

436
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
create this text box

437
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
ctrl v to paste there we go make that

438
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
white

439
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,839
uh ctrl a to select it all i'm going to

440
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
make this one slightly bigger than this

441
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
body text over here so this was size to

442
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
12. i'm going to size this at maybe uh

443
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
16 see how that looks

444
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
that looks pretty good i'm going to go

445
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
ahead and remove some of this that we

446
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,760
don't have so much of that in there

447
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
okay looking pretty good now if you're

448
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
not happy with the width of this text

449
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
what you can do is let me zoom in a

450
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
little bit

451
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,760
you can move this over like this

452
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
and then you can go back to the text

453
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
tool and take this node right here and

454
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
just snap it to the right side so that

455
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
it changes the uh the orientation of it

456
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
like that

457
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
now let me grab the select tool i want

458
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,519
to center this text up within this blue

459
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
object so i'm going to hold shift and

460
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
click on the blue text i mean the blue

461
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
object

462
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
and i'm going to change the relative to

463
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
i'm going to change that to last

464
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
selected

465
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,279
and i'm going to center it up on the

466
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,880
horizontal axis like that

467
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
and now i want this text to to be

468
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
text so let me click and drag over those

470
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839

503
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
to where it says lower selection to the

504
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:49,920
bottom

selection

510
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
one step and if at any point you want to

511
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
see how your design is looking without

512
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,160
these guides in the way you could just

513
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
come over here where it says view

514
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
and then deselect guides what i like to

515
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,519
do is use the keyboard shortcut which is

516
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:07,920
this

517
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
vertical line right here so i'm going to

518
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,440
toggle them off and on to see how they

519
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,480
look

520
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,079
okay so let me center this up on the

521
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,000
blue box right here let me select that

522
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
hold shift click on the blue box

523
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
center it up vertically and horizontally

524
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
like that click off of it to deselect

525
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
everything

526
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,720
take just this blue box and bring the

527
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,079
opacity down a little bit so

528
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
the image shows beneath it then i want

529
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,759
to take this image

530
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,600
hold ctrl and shift and scale it down

531
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,759
like that

532
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
that's pretty good let me zoom in move

533
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
this up

534
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
okay so now i just want to crop this

535
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
image so that it fits this blue square

536
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
right here so let me take the blue

537
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,639
square

538
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
right click it go to duplicate hold

539
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,839
shift

540
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
click on the image and go to object clip

541
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
object clip set and there we go

542
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
now let me take this and just adjust the

543
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
opacity so that some of it shows through

544
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
that right there looks pretty good

545
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
now let me zoom out i'm going to come

546
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
over here now to where it says view let

547
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,839
me toggle off the guide so we can see

548
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,800
how it looks

549
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
and as you can see our design is looking

550
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
pretty good now you can use this area

551
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
here to import like an infographic or a

552
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
pie chart or something like i did i'm

553
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
going to leave it blank for now

554
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
as it stands this design is looking like

555
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,199
it's finished so what i'm going to do is

556
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
i'm going to save it as a pdf document

557
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,079
i'll go to file

558
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,120
save as i'm just going to title this

559
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,920
thing

560
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,040
report and for the file

561
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,880
save save as type i'm going to change

562
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
that to pdf

563
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
right there there we go and i'll go

564
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,600
ahead and save

565
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
you leave the defaults as they are go

566
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,519
ahead and click ok

567
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,000
ok now the downside of one of the other

568
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
downsides of doing this with inkscape is

569
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
that you'll have to design

570
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
your report or your book one page at a

571
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,320
time

572
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
and then save all of the individual

573
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
pages as individual pdfs

574
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
and then use something like pdf sam to

575
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
merge the pdf document together i'll

576
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,600
show you that in just a minute

577
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
again this is one of the downsides of

578
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
using inkscape that's why i recommend if

579
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,079
you're creating something really long

580
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,160
like a 50 or 60 page book

581
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
probably not a good idea to use inkscape

582
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,039
but if you just want to create a one or

583
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
two page report like this

584
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
that's fine so let me um let me uh

585
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
minimize this now let me come back over

586
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,160
here to my folder i'm looking for

587
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,280
report.pdf what i'm going to do is we're

588
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
going to save a second copy of this

589
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,400
file save as i'm going to save a second

590
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
a second copy of this just so i can

591
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,840
demonstrate how this works

592
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,200
report to

593
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,240
pdf click save

594
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
so now what i've done here is i opened

595
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
up a piece of software known as pdf sam

596
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
this is a free piece of software i'll

597
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,799
have a link in the description if you

598
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
want to download it this just allows you

599
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
to merge pdf documents together pretty

600
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,960
quickly

601
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
if you want you can use a web-based

602
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,919
solution if you'd like you don't have to

603
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,360
download software to do this

604
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
come over here to where it says merge

605
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
and i'm going to take these two

606
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,840
documents and place them in here like

607
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,120
this and it's going to ask you where you

608
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
want to place this i'm going to place it

609
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
where it originally was

610
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
and i'm going to leave everything as it

611
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,160
is and click run

612
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
and there we go so let me open up this

613
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,559
document

614
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
and as you can see here we have a

615
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
two-page pdf document that we created

616
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
with inkscape and you can take this text

617
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
and highlight it and copy and paste it

618
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
just like you would with any other pdf

619
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,320
document

620
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,760
and the great thing about this again is

621
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
since we created this in inkscape this

622
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,559
is a vector

623
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,880
design meaning you can zoom in on this

624
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
and you won't get that pixelization you

625
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,120
get that

626
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,799
the benefit of working with vectors like

627
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,280
that so i think that should do it for

628
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
this tutorial that's how you can go

629
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,000
about using inkscape

630
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,799
for some pretty rudimentary desktop

631
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,160
publishing purposes

632
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
if you have any questions just leave a

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,180
