1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,159
in this video I'll be demonstrating some

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,879
of the more advanced Transformations

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,000
that you can make when working with

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,120
nodes and inkscape by showing you how to

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,480
create this cassette tape design and

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,719
this will be more of an advanced

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,000
tutorial in that I'm not going to be

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,559
going over every step in fine detail but

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,359
if you're already somewhat familiar with

10
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,920
the software you should be able to get a

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,359
sense of what I'm doing as I go through

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,840
these steps so I'm going to come over

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,080
here into new document and get started

14
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,039
I'm going to draw a rectangle to start

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,320
off and let me grab my selection tool

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,560
I'm going to make this rectangle I

17
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,280
believe I used 400 by

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,600
250 and let me zoom in on this let me go

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,040
back to my rectangle tool I'm going to

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,320
make these Corners a little

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,280
rounded there we go and now I'm going to

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,920
put some circles in the corners to uh

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,120
serve as screws the screws in the

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,199
corners of the uh cassette tape so I'll

25
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,600
put that right there and I'll make a few

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
copies of this I'm going to press

27
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,719
controll D or command D to duplicate it

28
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,160
move this over

29
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,960
here make another duplicate of these

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,680
bring these down here

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
and I'm going to group these together

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,319
and I'm going to Center this up on the

33
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,799
document here so let me open this up and

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,880
Center it so now I have the four screws

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,000
centered in the uh corners of the

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,200
cassette tape as you can see here that's

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,520
uh this part of the design so let me

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
come back in here and next I'm going to

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,720
create the bottom part this uh this

40
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,119
little bottom part of the design right

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,400
here so I'm going to grab my rectangle

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,240
tool again and I'm going to click and

43
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,880
drag to draw a

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
rectangle and I'm going to make the

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,439
corners of this one Shar for now I'm

46
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,159
going to go back and make those Corners

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
rounded later on but I first want to

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
change the I want to distort the shape

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
of

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,680
this so I'll convert this to a

51
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
path grab my nodes tool and I want to

52
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,719
grab these two nodes right here and let

53
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,200
me scale those down I don't know why

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
that just layered beneath the other

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,799
object but I'll have to raise that up

56
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,399
again let me move that

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,520
up okay that looks good right there I

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,039
want to round these Corners a little bit

59
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,240
so I'm going to come over here and

60
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,360
choose the uh this handy new feature the

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
corner is live path effect I'm going to

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
select all of the

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
nodes and I'm going to scale let me turn

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
off the scaling handles and I'm going to

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,239
bring this in like this just to make

66
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,440
these

67
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,160
rounded there we go and I just want to

68
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,440
make sure that this is centered there we

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,319
go and I'm going to put some

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,640
more I'm going to put these uh these

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
little round parts of the design in

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,560
there now so let me come back over here

73
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
and for that I'll just duplicate let me

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,319
ungroup these circles I'm just going to

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
duplicate these circles and use these

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,160
copies to make those uh to make those

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,800
parts of the design I'll scale that

78
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,840
up duplicate that control D or command D

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
is the shortcut for duplicating very

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
handy shortcut to

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,599
know move that over let me zoom out a

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,720
little bit to see how that looks in

83
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,360
proportion I guess that looks pretty

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
good maybe I'll make it a little

85
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,879
smaller and I'm going to duplicate the

86
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,640
these and I will flip these horizontally

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,760
and move these over here and now I want

88
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,040
to Center this up on the uh bottom part

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,000
of this design here so let me group that

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,480
and I'll Center these

91
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,599
together let me move that down it looked

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,879
better down there there we go now I can

93
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,400
ungroup

94
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,159
them okay so the next part of the design

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
I will make is I'll make this inner part

96
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
of the cassette tape or the label so let

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,560
me come back in here I'm going to grab

98
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,319
my rectangle tool and I'm going to make

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,159
a rectangle in the uh on the inside of

100
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,080
the uh cassette tape there and let me

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
just make sure I have this centered up

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
on the other rectangle there we go and

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm going to change this a little bit

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,599
let me make this a little less tall

105
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,319
vertically and I want to convert this to

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,519
a path as well and now to make the

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,519
corners have this cut off effect we're

108
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,040
going to use a path effect for that so

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,720
let me come back over here to my nodes

110
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,079
tool and I want to enable the Corner's

111
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,319
live path effect again and I want to

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,519
select both of these and now I can roll

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,239
them down like that now the corners are

114
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,720
rounded right now but that's okay we're

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,200
going to go in and change that setting

116
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,000
so I'm going to open up the path effects

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
menu path path

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,840
effects and now I should be able to

119
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,959
change the corners to chamfer and now I

120
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,639
have those squared Corners that I

121
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,040
preferred let me make those a little

122
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,040
less let me scale those down a little

123
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,639
bit oh okay that looks good now we can

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,759
close out of that uh let me get out of

125
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,000
that and the next part I guess I will

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,160
make I I'll start working on the little

127
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,120
spindles here in the center this is uh

128
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,039
probably the most elaborate part of this

129
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,720
whole thing so let's go get that

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,919
started I'm going to grab my circles and

131
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,960
ellipses tool and I'm going to click and

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,919
drag to draw a

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,440
circle and let move this over I'm going

134
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,960
to duplicate this circle make this

135
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,080
circle a little

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
smaller and I'm going to make these

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
teeth that go on the inside of the uh

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
the spindle there so let me deselect

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
everything and to do this I'm going to

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
use clones and this is going to make it

141
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
a lot easier to adjust things I'll show

142
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,840
you what I mean here I'm going to click

143
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,680
and drag to draw a rectangle it's going

144
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,639
to represent one of the teeth of this uh

145
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,240
of the spindle and I'm going to right

146
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
click this and go to instead of

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
duplicate I'm going to use clone and I'm

148
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,120
going to take the Clone copy and I'm

149
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,759
going to bring it down

150
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,120
here and I just want to group both of

151
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,479
these together make sure I have them

152
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,120
centered on the circle so let me come

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,960
back over here to my aligned distribute

154
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,160
menu and now I'm going to clone these

155
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
again so I'm going to right click and go

156
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
to clone and I'm going to rotate this

157
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
copy that many steps and then I'll clone

158
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
that again so I'll right click that go

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,639
to clone and I'll rotate it hold the

160
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,319
control key and just rotate it around

161
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,960
like that there we go now the reason I

162
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
did that is because if I want to change

163
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,639
the width of these teeth sometimes

164
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,080
you'll make it too big or too small

165
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,000
without realizing it uh you'll have to

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
go back and undo all of it when you use

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
clones though you can just adjust one of

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
them and it adjusts all of them so I'm

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
going to hold my shift key and scale

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,440
this part in like that and it's going to

171
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,800
change the size of all the other teeth

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
like that so let me move that out a

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,720
little bit it looks better in a larger

174
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,400
size let me zoom out a little bit it's

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,199
hard to really perfectly visualize how

176
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,720
it's going to look until you unify it

177
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,199
with the other

178
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,840
shape let me try that one more

179
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
time okay I think I'll leave that as it

180
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,759
is I'm going to select all of these now

181
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,039
I have all of them selected and I'm

182
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,880
going to unlink the Clones so I'll go to

183
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,639
edit and I will choose clone and I will

184
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,840
select unlink clone and now I can

185
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,560
ungroup them we'll go to object ungroup

186
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,280
and unify them all together path Union

187
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,000
and then subtract it from that smaller

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
Circle so I'll hold shift and click on

189
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,360
that Circle and go to path difference

190
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,759
and now we have the teeth of the uh of

191
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,879
that wheel there let me scale that up a

192
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,599
little

193
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,039
bit and I'll take this part and scale

194
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,240
this

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,080
down and now I'm going to create the uh

196
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,639
the tape going around the uh the wheel

197
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,680
here so let me Zoom back out let me come

198
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,280
back in here and I'll take this larger

199
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,240
Circle I'm going to remove the fill and

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,479
I'm going to make a duplicate of this

201
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm going to press command D and then

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,000
hold control and shift and scale this up

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,599
about that much and I'm going to take

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,360
both of these circles now and I'm going

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,080
to combine them together so I'll go to

206
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,360
path and I will choose combine and now

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm going to apply the interp

208
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,680
interpolate path effects so I'm going to

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,199
come over here to my path effects menu

210
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,680
and I'm looking for

211
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,319
interpolate uh interpolate interpolate

212
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,319
sub paths not points the one they use

213
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,319
here is sub paths and now I can increase

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,120
or

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,599
decrease the uh number of paths between

216
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,400
those circles I think this looks good

217
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,759
with seven for now but I'm going to go

218
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,720
back and change that later as I adjust

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
things so for now that looks good I'll

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
leave it at

221
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
seven and next I will I'm going to make

222
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
a duplicate copy of this and move this

223
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,319
over here so we have two of these now so

224
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm going to select all of these let me

225
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,440
group it together let me duplicate this

226
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,759
and just move this one over like

227
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,319
that and then I'll group these together

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,039
and then Center them on this uh larger

229
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,039
rectangle and that looks pretty

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
good okay let me ungroup those

231
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,720
now and now I'm going to trim off the

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,440
edges I'm going create I'm going to

233
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,679
create the inner part like the window I

234
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,159
guess you can call it of this cassette

235
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,479
tape and I'm going to trim off all of

236
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,599
the other excess areas so let me come

237
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
back in here and to do that I'm going to

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,440
turn on my snapping and I'm going to

239
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,919
draw a

240
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
rectangle I'll start the

241
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
rectangle up here and I'll end it down

242
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
here like that and I'm going to grab my

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
selection tool now and I'm going to snap

244
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,440
it to the right Edge and then snap it to

245
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,079
the left Edge basically I'm creating a

246
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,519
rounded rectangle that goes around the

247
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,240
two wheels of the cassette tape so I'm

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
going to grab my rectangle tool now and

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,120
round the

250
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,160
corners there we go that's the effect

251
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm going for and what I'll do next is

252
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm going to convert this to a path

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
we'll get to path object to

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,800
path grab my selection tool and I'm

255
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,240
going to duplicate this and now I want

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,560
to select all of the wheels I'm going to

257
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
select the uh I'm going to select this

258
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
wheel right here and I'm going to hold

259
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,399
shift and select this wheel right here

260
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,880
and I want to group them all together by

261
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,480
pressing command G or contr G and I want

262
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
to take this duplicate copy and then

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,120
select the grouped wheels and go to

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,040
object clip set clip so now it is a

265
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
clipped object and what I could do now

266
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,240
is I can take this rectangle and

267
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,200
duplicate that we'll go to duplicate and

268
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,880
I will apply an offset to that so I will

269
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,519
go to path and

270
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,760
choose Dynamic

271
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,959
offset let me go to my nodes tool I'm

272
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,360
going to take this node and bring that

273
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,640
out let me turn off my snapping for now

274
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,360
and I think that looks pretty good as it

275
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
is I think I'll will leave it like that

276
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,240
now I want to create some asymmetry

277
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,519
between these two wheels here if you

278
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,440
notice in my original design there's

279
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,640
more tape on this wheel than there is on

280
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,120
this wheel so that's the effect I want

281
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,079
to uh I want to create to do that I'm

282
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,160
going to uh and this is where path

283
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,519
effects really come in handy because

284
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,160
this is still editable as a path effect

285
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
so if I go to my nodes tool I can still

286
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,120
select this and I'm going to select

287
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,959
these nodes I'm going to hold shift and

288
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,320
click on them and I'll turn on my

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
transformation handles and now I can

290
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,279
scale this up like that and all those

291
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,760
other circles in there scale with it the

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
problem is that there are a little more

293
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,720
SPAC out so I'm going to go back into my

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,399
uh path effects menu and add some more

295
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,839
sub paths in

296
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,120
there and I'll do the opposite over here

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,639
I'll maybe shrink this one down a little

298
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,079
bit let me move this

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,079
over and let me select these

300
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
nodes and I'll scale these ones

301
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,440
down and now I will remove some of those

302
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,760
sub paths in there to make it look

303
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
evenly spaced out with the other ones so

304
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,320
that looks a lot better I think let me

305
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,360
turn off the uh transformation

306
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,480
handles and that looks a lot better we

307
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,399
have some asymmetry there now between

308
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,079
those two uh objects now I just want to

309
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,000
size this up so it fits the cassette

310
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,760
tape overall and uh and it's nicely

311
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
aligned um you know what before I do

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
that let's trim off all of this other

313
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,600
excess stuff because if I go to my nodes

314
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,160
tool you can see if I hover my cursor

315
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,040
these other lines still exist with

316
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,360
within the clip you just don't see them

317
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
because they're hidden behind the

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
clipping mask that we created I want to

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
finalize these and make these um like

320
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
plain Vector paths so to do that I'm

321
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
going to select this all and I'm going

322
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,160
to come over here into the shape Builder

323
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,639
tool and now I'm just going to build the

324
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,040
shape that I want out of this so I'm

325
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,399
going to click on this part to add that

326
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,120
and everything that I make blue is going

327
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,360
to be what gets kept and everything

328
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,440
that's not blue will be deleted so I'm

329
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,040
going to combine all of this

330
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,160
together

331
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
and I'm making separate shapes out of

332
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,160
each of these because I want everything

333
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,240
in here to be its own shape so I can add

334
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
color to it which you will see in just a

335
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,079
few minutes so that right there is what

336
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm going for I want everything divided

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
into its own shape and if I go back to

338
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,160
my selection tool now it is everything

339
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
uh it's designed just how I want it so I

340
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
have these individual shapes here that I

341
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,199
can edit and work with however I need so

342
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,600
now that that's done let me select

343
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,680
everything here and group it together

344
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,360
and I want to center it up over this

345
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,920
rectangle so let me come back into my

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
alignment tab and I may have to make

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,399
this one a little bigger relative to the

348
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,720
relative to the uh the tape because

349
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,480
normally the wheel goes out almost past

350
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
the corner of this uh part of the tape

351
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
right here so I got to make mine oops

352
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
let me undo that I got to make mine a

353
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,560
little bigger uh maybe not bigger but

354
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,320
longer so let me ungroup everything I'm

355
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,199
going to grab my nodes tool and I'm

356
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,120
going to select these nodes over here

357
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,480
and I'll just move these over like

358
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,199
that and now we're elongating it without

359
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,959
having to um scale it so let me group it

360
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
together now and let me try centering it

361
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
again see if it looks any better and

362
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,279
that's more along the lines of what I'm

363
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,519
going for you know what I think

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,000
something got taken off center here let

365
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,199
me redo that this is one of the

366
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,959
downsides of working with a trackpad if

367
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,279
I'm working with the mouse I don't have

368
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,000
that problem so now let's uh let's make

369
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,440
these little lines right here this this

370
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,760
is like a blank label where you can

371
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,120
write in your own label on the cassette

372
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,959
tape I'm going to grab the pen tool to

373
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,760
make

374
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,519
those hold control so we get a straight

375
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,600
line press enter to close the path and

376
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,519
I'm going to make this the same size as

377
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,519
The Strokes on the other shapes which is

378
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,800
three so I'll come back over here stroke

379
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,639
style tab make this three pixels I want

380
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,800
this to have rounded

381
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,920
caps and I'll make a duplicate of this

382
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,240
and bring this down here so I'm going to

383
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,959
hold the control

384
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,639
key that looks good maybe I'll make this

385
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,959
a little

386
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,880
bigger and I'm just going to size this

387
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,839
up and adjust it until it looks

388
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,959
right okay there we go so I'm going for

389
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,480
a nice balanced look here where

390
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
everything is spaced up spaced out

391
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,360
nicely I'm going to ungroup that now and

392
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,279
the cassette tape part of the design is

393
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,440
finished now I want to create this um

394
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,320
this rainbow ribbon background here that

395
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,959
I put behind the cassette tape so let me

396
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
come back over here for this I want to

397
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,920
make sure I have my snapping enabled and

398
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,519
I'm going to grab my rectangle tool and

399
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm going to draw a elongated

400
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
rectangle and I'm going to make the

401
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,519
corner Sharp and I want to make cop I

402
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,880
want to make five copies of this so I'm

403
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,160
going to press control D to make a copy

404
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,800
I'll snap this copy over here to the

405
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,399
left end or to the right end and I'll

406
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,279
just repeat this until I have five

407
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,759
copies there we go let me select all of

408
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,519
those convert them to a

409
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
path path object to path and now I'm

410
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,320
going to do I'm going to duplicate these

411
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
and I'm going to put these down here and

412
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,480
snap these to the bottom and this time

413
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,279
I'm going to go with combin so I'll go

414
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,720
with uh path and and I will choose

415
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,279
combine and I'm going to move this

416
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,959
up and now I want to use the perspective

417
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,399
path effect to make this uh wider so I'm

418
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,759
going to come back over here to my path

419
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,800
effects and I'm looking for

420
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,720
perspective there we go grab my nodes

421
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,800
tool I want to lock this in the uh or

422
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,920
mirror it in the vertical axis and now I

423
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,000
can just scale that out like

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,920
that that looks pretty good now I'm

425
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
going to convert that to a path as well

426
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
we go to path object to path grab my S

427
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,399
ction tool and I want to break this

428
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,880
apart so I'll go to path and I will

429
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
choose break apart and now these should

430
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
already be broken apart yeah I need

431
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,880
these to be individual objects so what

432
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,959
I'm going to do is I'm going to start

433
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
unifying these objects together I'm

434
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
going to hold my option key or ALT key

435
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,240
and just draw a line between those two

436
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
objects unify them together by going to

437
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,959
path Union or the keyboard shortcut is

438
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,720
control shift and the plus key so I'm

439
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
just going to use that for the rest of

440
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,720
these we're going to repeat this process

441
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,319
I'm going select those unify those

442
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,160
together

443
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,440
do the same thing over here oops let me

444
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,680
un deselect

445
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,360
that control shift plus

446
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
deselect select these ones and there you

447
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,839
go one more to

448
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
go okay so that's what we're going for

449
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,120
now and to make these rounded what I

450
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
will do is I want to select all of them

451
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,560
first so I'm going to hold shift and

452
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,279
click on each of

453
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,240
these

454
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,800
and I want to combine these together so

455
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,680
I'll go to path and I will choose

456
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
combine let me move move this out of the

457
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,399
way of the cassette tape I'm going to

458
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,680
turn off the snapping now and I'm going

459
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,160
to go back to the nodes tool and I'm

460
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,480
going to turn on the corner live path

461
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,160
effect for this and I'm going to select

462
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
these nodes right here let me try that

463
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,519
again there we go and I'm just going to

464
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,199
round this like that so we get a nice

465
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,480
rounded effect

466
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,160
there

467
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
okay that looks good I'll leave that as

468
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,839
it is and now I'm going to go into my

469
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,119
shape Builder tool and I'm just going to

470
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,760
click on each of these one by one to

471
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,280
make sure that they are all separate

472
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
shapes and that they no longer have the

473
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
path effect applied they're just plain

474
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
Vector pads and there you go now we're

475
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,799
finished so let me go back over here now

476
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,559
and I could take this and move this over

477
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,480
here you know what let me leave this

478
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
here I'm going to take the cassette tape

479
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,079
group it together and place it over on

480
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,439
top of uh this backdrop here I want to

481
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,039
raise this up so it's layered above

482
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,840
it and I'm going to Center both of

483
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,039
these and the final step is to just add

484
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,520
some color as you can see that I've done

485
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
over here in my original design so let

486
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,559
me come back in here I'm going to start

487
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,000
coloring this thing in so I'll start

488
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
with these stripes down here let me

489
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
ungroup these or break them apart rather

490
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,880
object path break

491
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,000
apart and for the colors it was just red

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
orange yellow green and blue so I'll add

493
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,559
some variation of those Shades let me

494
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,120
start with this

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
one and now I'm going to start adding

496
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
some color to the cassette tape so let

497
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,159
me ungroup that

498
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,480
now and I want to change the color I'm

499
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,960
going to use this object right here as a

500
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
starting point I'll make that one white

501
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,799
and I'll make this one white as well and

502
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,400
the smaller shape inside of it I'm going

503
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,159
to hold my ALT key to select that

504
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,520
smaller shape and I'm going to make this

505
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,760
a dark shade of gray about as dark as it

506
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,039
can get without it Contra without it

507
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,880
losing its contrast with the black

508
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,640
stroke so I'm going to go with a really

509
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,520
dark shade let me go over here to my

510
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
fill and stroke menu and adjust this

511
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,480
manually make it a little darker that

512
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,080
looks pretty good and I'm going to use

513
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,760
this shade for a lot of other things so

514
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm going to select this one over here

515
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,440
use the same color with my dropper tool

516
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
and I will select this shape in

517
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,799
here let me try that again there we go I

518
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,880
want to make that the same color and I

519
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,679
want to make all of these wheels that

520
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,960
same color or that same shade of gray

521
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,559
rather there we go and I could take this

522
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,720
rectangle I'm going to make this a

523
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,000
darker shade of gray I'll make this a

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
lighter shade of

525
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,080
gray and I'll make this one over here a

526
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,480
much lighter shade of gray it's going to

527
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
be gray but it's going to be much

528
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,679
lighter and now I'm going to take the uh

529
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,720
well I'm going to take this shape right

530
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
here I'll start here and I will make

531
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,159
this the same shade of gray that this

532
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,360
cassette tape is and now I can take the

533
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,919
tape inside of here or the rolls of uh

534
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,320
tape and I'm going to select all of

535
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,679
those and make them this shade maybe

536
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,799
I'll make these a little bit

537
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,960
darker and then I'll do the same thing

538
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
over here with these ones I'll select

539
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,840
these ones as

540
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,919
well and I'm not quite satisfied with

541
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,200
the contrast between these darker Shades

542
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,880
of Gray so let me make those a little

543
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,720
darker I'm going to select that and I

544
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,240
want to apply this to all of the other

545
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
objects that have that color so I'll go

546
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,760
to edit select same and I'll choose fill

547
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,880
color and now that I have those all

548
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,080
selected I can change the shade and

549
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,240
darken it as

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,320
needed okay that looks good

551
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,440
enough all right so I guess one last

552
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,080
step would be to add a background as

553
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,679
I've done here let me just go back in

554
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,360
here I'm going to turn on snapping to do

555
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,799
this makes it a lot easier I'll snap to

556
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
this corner and then I'll snap to this

557
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
corner up here and now I can just grab

558
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,039
my selection tool and scale this out as

559
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,080
needed again using the snapping controls

560
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,320
let me send this to the

561
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,640
bottom let me make this a shade of

562
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,600
yellow I'll use this as a starting point

563
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,520
but I want it to be

564
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,880
lighter and there you go that should do

565
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
it for this tutorial that's how you can

566
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,840
use some of the more advanced uh node

567
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,039
editing features in in incap to create

568
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,400
something like this cassette tape design

569
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
if you found this lesson useful then

570
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,080
consider checking out my inkscape master

571
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,280
class it's a collection of over 60

572
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,919
videos where I go over all of the tools

573
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,000
and features in inkscape and I explain

574
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,520
what they are and demonstrate how they

575
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,279
work kind of like how I did in this

576
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,600
video we even have a private Community
