1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
when inkscape released version 1.0

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,240
earlier this year they made a pretty big

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,759
change to the way that the stroke to

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,879
path function works

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,480
and it was significant enough that it

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
actually broke some of my older

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,719
tutorials

8
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,400
so i wanted to put this video together

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
to address this problem and how you can

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,839
work around it if you're following along

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
with one of my older tutorials

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,119
and getting stuck on the stroke to path

13
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,590
part

14
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,500
[Music]

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
so on my screen here i have two

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
different versions of inkscape opened

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,120
this is the older version of inkscape

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,040
which is

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,800
0.92.5 and then this over here is the

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
new version of inkscape which is version

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,600
1.0

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,120
and as you can see i have the same

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
object posted into each

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,039
each installation if you notice this is

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
a circle it's a green circle with a

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
green fill and a red stroke as you can

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,079
see here in the data

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,800
the fill is green the stroke is red and

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,760
what happens is

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
in the older version of inkscape if you

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
go to path

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
stroke to path it takes that red stroke

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760
and turns it into a path of its own if

34
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
you go to the nodes tool you'll see

35
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
now that is now a red object of its own

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
it's no longer a stroke

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
so let me just undo that and come over

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
here to the newer version of inkscape to

39
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
show you how it works now

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
now if you go to path stroke to path

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
nothing visual nothing visibly changes

42
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
on the screen but what it did was it

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,840
took

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
this it took the red stroke and turned

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
it into a path of its own

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,000
only it didn't get rid of the green fill

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,240
it kept the green fill as a separate

48
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,880
object

49
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
grouped together with the red stroke and

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
to see what i mean you'll have to go to

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,360
object

52
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,759
ungroup and you can see it is now two

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,360
separate objects so you have this here

54
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
you have this red stroke which is now

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
its own path but it also

56
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
kept this green fill here as a separate

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,799
object

58
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,759
so let me undo this even further i want

59
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
to show you what the uh the work around

60
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
is now

61
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
let's come back over here to the

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
original one now in the if you're

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
following along with one of these

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
tutorials and i tell you to do stroke to

65
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,360
path

66
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
break apart union let me show you how

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
that works if you go to path

68
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,960
stroke to path path break apart

69
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,160
path union you end up with this right

70
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,878
here

71
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,280
this this sequence doesn't work in the

72
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
new installation of inkscape though so

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
what you have to do is you have to

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
select it

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,120
and go to path stroke to path

76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
and then object on group

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
and then path union so basically what

78
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
you're doing is we're taking the

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,080
sequence

80
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
stroke to path break apart union and

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,080
replacing it with

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
stroke to path on group union i'll have

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
this all written

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
out in the description below in case you

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
find it easier to follow along with that

86
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,519
so

87
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
i just wanted to put this video together

88
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
real quick to address that problem

89
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
hopefully this isn't too much of a

90
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
disruption to your learning experience

91
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
if you have any questions just leave a

92
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
comment below and as always thanks for

93
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
watching
