00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
in a previous tutorial from a few years

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,959
ago we went over how you can apply

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,839
Vector Textures in inkscape by using

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,660
path operations as it turns out though

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,760
there is a more efficient way to

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,679
accomplish this using a relatively new

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,719
feature in inkscape known as inverse

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,160
masking and I'd like to share that with

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,380
you in this tutorial

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,480
so to get us started here the object I

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,000
will be working with is this text object

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
here that was previously a text object

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,779
but I converted it to a path now it's

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,039
important to understand that what we're

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,560
going to do in this lesson only works on

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,780
objects that are vector pads so if

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,000
you're working with a text object or a

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
shape that you've drawn with the shape

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,180
tool you'll have to convert it to a path

20
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,160
first by selecting it and going to path

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,620
and selecting object to path and once

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,180
you do that you'll be good to go so what

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm going to do now is import my Vector

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,260
texture I'm going to open my folder and

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm going to grab the SVG file and just

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,700
click and drag that onto the canvas if

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,960
you want to follow along with what I'm

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,219
doing here I'll put a link in the

29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,239
description to where you can download

30
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,020
these textures

31
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,699
and once it's imported I'm just going to

32
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,559
scale it down and size it up and

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,360
position it where I would like it to be

34
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,159
relative to the subject that I'll be

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,840
applying it to so I'm going to move this

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,939
on top of it like that

37
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,740
now normally what we would do is we

38
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,720
would select both of these objects and

39
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,340
do a path difference but the problem

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,680
with using an object like a texture to

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
do something like that is that this

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,580
texture consists of thousands of nodes

43
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,200
maybe even tens of thousands of nodes

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,479
and if you perform path operations with

45
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,220
it it's going to slow down your computer

46
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,500
a lot so it's a really inefficient way

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,240
of doing things instead what we're going

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,280
to do is with both objects selected we

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,799
will go to object

50
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,979
mask and we're going to choose set

51
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,619
inverse mask

52
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,900
and once you do that it's going to apply

53
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,240
the texture to the object as you can see

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
there and if I zoom in all the way you

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,380
can see that the vector element has been

56
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,320
preserved in fact all of that texture in

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,759
there is negative space if I were to

58
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,320
grab my rectangle tool and draw a

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,680
rectangle and position that beneath

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,180
everything

61
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,979
you can see those negative you can see

62
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,360
the black background showing through

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,818
those negative space areas like that

64
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,500
now if at any point you want to remove

65
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,060
the texture the good thing about this

66
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,459
instead of using path operations is that

67
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,140
it's also non-destructive so you can

68
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,580
undo this at any point you could just

69
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,160
select the object and go to object and

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,819
go to mask and choose release mask

71
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,540
foreign

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,099
point you have your preserved text

73
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,620
object and the vector texture as it was

74
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,660
previously so that is a much more

75
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,520
efficient way of applying Vector

76
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,160
textures to objects using inkscape if

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,540
you found this lesson useful then

78
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,459
consider checking out my inkscape master

79
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,739
class it's a collection of over 60

80
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,660
videos where I go over all of the tools

81
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,400
and features in inkscape and I explain

82
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,140
what they are and demonstrate how they

83
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,940
work kind of like how I did in this

84
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
video we even have a private Community

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
where you can ask questions and get help

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,540
from me anytime you want and best of all

87
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,519
there's no monthly membership fees you

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,580
just pay 17 one time and you're in for

89
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,260
Life I'll have some information about

90
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,400
that down below if you want to check

91
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,560
that out as always thanks for watching

92
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,819
thank you
