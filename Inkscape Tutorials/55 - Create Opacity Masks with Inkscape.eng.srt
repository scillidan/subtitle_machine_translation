1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,680
if you're familiar with how gradients

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,199
work in inkscape then you probably

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,880
already know that you can take an object

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,799
and give it partial transparency

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
by applying a gradient like that now as

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
you can see the left-hand side of the

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
object still has all of its color

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
whereas the right-hand side slowly

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,400
transitions to transparency what if you

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,920
wanted to do the same thing to a group

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
of objects though

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
well if you select your group of objects

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,000
and you try to apply

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a gradient the same way you end up with

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,199
something like this right here it's

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
pretty safe to say that this is probably

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
not the effect you're going for

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
so how would you go about applying

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
partial transparency to this group of

20
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
objects like you did to this object

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,160
right here

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
this is where opacity masks will come

23
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,600
into play and that's what i will be

24
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,840
demonstrating in this tutorial

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
this is nick with logosbynick.com and in

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
you can create an opacity mask

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
using inkscape before we get started

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
though if you'd like to learn everything

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
that there is to know about inkscape

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
be sure to check out my inkscape master

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
class it's a collection of over 60

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,479
videos where i go over every tool and

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,600
feature in inkscape

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
and i explain what it is and demonstrate

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,799
how it works i'll have a link in the

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,840
description of the video if you want to

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
check that out

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
so to get us started here in inkscape as

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
you can see i have this selection of

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,439
objects here if i

42
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
click and drag over all of them this is

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
uh this entire design consists of a

44
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
bunch of individual objects

45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
i'm going to go ahead and group them

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
together using this button right here

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
that says group selected objects

48
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
and what i want to do is apply an

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,080
opacity mask to this

50
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
so that i can have partial transparency

51
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
so to do that let me first open up the

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
fill and stroke menu which is over here

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
you can click on this or you can go to

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,880
object

55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
fill and stroke and that will open up

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
that menu right here okay

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

58
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,439
use the masking feature instead of

59
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
applying a linear gradient like i would

60
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
with an individual object

61
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
i'm going to use the masking feature

62
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
instead okay and the way

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
masking works is that you take an object

64
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,720
and you apply it over the group of

65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
objects

66
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
and whatever whenever the object is

67
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
black it becomes transparent on the

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
group of objects but when it's white it

69
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
becomes opaque

70
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
it's a lot easier for me to demonstrate

71
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
how this works and it is to explain it

72
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
so let me go ahead and do that i'm going

73
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,959
to grab the squares and rectangles tool

74
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,080
and i'm going to click and drag to

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
create a rectangle covering the entire

76
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
subject here

77
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

78
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
make this black and i'm going to give

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
this a linear gradient with this button

80
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
right here

81
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
and i'm going to click on this stop on

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,959
the right hand side and i'm just going

83
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
to make that white so we have a gradient

84
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
going from black

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
to white like this now how this works is

86
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
what when i take

87
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
this object right here and apply it as a

88
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,560
mask

89
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
to the group of objects beneath it

90
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,239
whatever is black

91
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
will become transparent and whatever is

92
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
white will remain opaque

93
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
okay so let me show you what i mean here

94
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
let me grab the select tool

95
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
let me click and drag over both of these

96
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
objects my grouping of objects

97
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
as well as the mask that i created here

98
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,519
with this rectangle

99
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
i can go to object mask

100
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
set and as you can see there's some

101
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
partial transparency here

102
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
over here on the right hand side was the

103
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
color white so this is more visible

104
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,080
whereas over here is the color black so

105
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
this becomes more transparent

106
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
now if you want to alter this further

107
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
you can go to object mask

108
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
release and let me click off of that to

109
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
deselect everything let me click on just

110
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,360
this object right here and i'm going to

111
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
grab the gradient tool which is right

112
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,920
here

113
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
and i'm going to move this white stop in

114
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
like this and i'm going to move this

115
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,040
black stop in like this and i'm holding

116
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
ctrl when i do this to lock it onto the

117
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
horizontal axis

118
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
now if i go back to the select tool and

119
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
i select both of those objects and go to

120
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
object mask set as you can see

121
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
the right hand side of this is more

122
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
visible now because there was more white

123
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
included in that

124
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,799
mask whereas the left hand side is more

125
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
transparent because there was more

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
black included in that mask and a tip

127
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
one helpful tip for how you can go about

128
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,799
adjusting this better what i'm going to

129
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,400
do is i'm going to release this

130
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
object mask release what you can do

131
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
is you can take this object right here

132
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
and bring the opacity down a little bit

133
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
so you can see exactly where the black

134
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
and white lines up

135
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
so if i take that and i go back to the

136
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
gradient tool i can take this white stop

137
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,000
and put it

138
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
directly in the middle like this and i

139
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
can take this black stop and put it

140
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,319
almost next to it like that and now what

141
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
i can do is go back to the select tool

142
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
take the object take the mask and bring

143
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
the opacity of it all the way back up

144
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,159
if you apply the mask with partial

145
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,599
transparency you're going to have

146
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
partial opacity in your object which is

147
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,720
not what you're looking for so

148
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
make sure to bring that opacity all the

149
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
way back up click and drag over

150
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,759
both objects object mask

151
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
set and there you go and i think that

152
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
should do it for this lesson that is how

153
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
you can go about creating an

154
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,479
opacity mask with inkscape and by the

155
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
way this doesn't just work with linear

156
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,199
gradients this can work

157
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
with a radial gradient as well i'll show

158
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
you that real quick i'm going to choose

159
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
a radial gradient

160
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
and let's go ahead and apply it again

161
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
object mask

162
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,000
set and as you can see the center where

163
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
the black was became transparent where

164
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,560
the outside

165
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
became fully opaque one last thing i

166
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,919
want to show you though before i end

167
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,639
this video

168
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
you can take your object go to the

169
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
gradient tool and you can click on

170
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
i believe it's this button right here

171
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
reverse the direction of the

172
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
gradient let's say you want the outside

173
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
to be black and the inside to be white

174
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
just click that button right there and

175
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
it reverses it for you

176
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
and now you can click and drag over both

177
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
of it go to object

178
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,080
mask set and there you go and that

179
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
should do it for this tutorial that is

180
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
how you can go about easily creating

181
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
an opacity mask using inkscape if you

182
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
have any questions leave a comment below

183
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
and as always thanks for watching
