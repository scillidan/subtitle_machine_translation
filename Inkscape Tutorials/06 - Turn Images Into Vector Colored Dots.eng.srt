1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,719
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,679
how you can use inkscape to trace an

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,560
image into a series of individual Vector

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,719
color dots and to show you what I mean

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,559
for my example here I started off with

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,320
this image which is a pixel-based image

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,519
and I was able to trace a series of

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
vector dots that all have a single fill

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,279
color and no gradients applied which is

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,080
what I'll be showing in this tutorial

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,560
before we get started though if you'd

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,160
like to learn more about inkscape be

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,800
sure to check out my inkscape master

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,880
class it's a collection of over 60

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,519
videos where I go over all of the tools

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,320
and features in inkscape and I explain

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,760
what they are and demonstrate how they

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,719
work we even have a private Community

19
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,360
where you can ask questions and get help

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
from me any time you want I'll have some

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,719
information about that down below if you

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
want to check that out so to get started

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm going to import my image into

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
inkscape and I want to make sure I have

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,399
my document the same size as the image

26
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,719
so click on the image and press control

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,079
shift R if you haven't done so already

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,120
and that will make the document the same

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,039
size as the selected image now let's

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
open up the layers menu by going to

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
layer and selecting layers and objects

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
and I want to make sure I have my image

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
on one layer by itself and I'm going to

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
add another layer on top of that so I'll

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,880
click on this plus icon up here and I'm

36
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,600
going to name this layer to which is the

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
default and I'll click

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,240
add and on this layer I want to create a

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
circle so I'm going to zoom into the top

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,840
left corner of my image and I'm going to

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,320
grab the circles and ellipses tool and

42
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
I'll click and drag to draw a circle and

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,880
I'll hold the control key while doing so

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
to make sure I can draw a perfectly

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
round circle like that so now I'll grabb

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
my selection tool and I'll open up the

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,040
fill and stroke menu by going to object

48
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,640
and selecting fill and

49
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,560
stroke and I'll come over here to the

50
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,159
fill Tab and I want to make sure I

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,079
choose this option right here which says

52
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,880
unset paint and when you have an unset

53
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,680
paint it should turn black by default

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
and what that will do is it'll make it

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,280
so that this object can trace all of the

56
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
objects it can trace the objects beneath

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,840
it and Sample a color from each copy

58
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
that we create so let me take this and

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
put this in the top left corner I'm

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,399
going to open up the aligned distribute

61
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,719
menu by going to object and selecting

62
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,000
aligned

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,439
distribute I'll set the relative two

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,639
make sure you have this set to page and

65
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm going to align this on the top Edge

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
and the left Edge and I'm going to zoom

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
out a little bit just as a

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
comparison I'm going to make the

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,200
circle about that big you can eyeball it

70
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
doesn't have to be a specific size I'll

71
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,080
go with that size right there and what

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
you want to do now is click on your

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
image and look up here in the width and

74
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,959
the height to see what the width and

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,319
height is and make a mental note of

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,840
whatever that is so my image is 872 by

77
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,360
1280 so I'll select my circle now and

78
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,760
with the circle selected I will go to

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,800
edit clone create tiled

80
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,640
clones and from this menu I want to

81
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,200
choose this option over here that says

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
width and height and I want to input the

83
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
width and height of my image so I'm

84
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,200
going to write 872 by 1280

85
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,640
and then I'll come over here to the

86
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,720
trace tab I want to enable tracing and I

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,519
want to enable color and I want to turn

88
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,360
off everything else so whatever else in

89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,599
here is enabled turn that off we only

90
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,040
want Trace color and color and width and

91
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,959
height and once that's done let me make

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,560
sure I have my object selected first

93
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
there we go my object got deselected

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,879
somehow that's important you got to have

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,239
your object selected and now I will make

96
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,040
sure I have everything set here and then

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,159
click create and when you click create

98
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,400
it may take a minute or two to load

99
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,879
because it's pretty CPU intensive mine

100
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,080
rendered pretty quick though so as you

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,879
can see the tracing has completed I'm

102
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,239
going to click the x button to get out

103
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,879
of this menu and if you zoom in on this

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
a little bit you can see the individual

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
color dots that were traced over the

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,599
image and what you could do now is you

107
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,720
can scale them down if you want so if I

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
were to select this dot if I were to

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,640
hold my ALT key or if you're on Mac it

110
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,079
would be the option key and click again

111
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,799
I would select the original dot on

112
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,640
underneath it and I would scale that

113
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
down by holding control and shift and

114
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,720
then scaling that down just a little bit

115
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,519
and the rest of the dots scale down with

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,560
it now I'm going to turn off the

117
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,480
visibility of the background image so

118
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,040
you can see this even better I'll come

119
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
over here to my layers menu and I'll

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
come all the way down here to the bottom

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
of the layers menu and I'm going to turn

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,160
off the visibility of layer one and you

123
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,400
can now see if you zoom out you can see

124
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,080
the image better but what I'm going to

125
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,560
do now is put a background Behind these

126
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,919
dots so you can see it better so I'll

127
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,720
grab my rectangle

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,880
tool I'll send this to the bottom and

129
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,320
now you can see it a little better okay

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
so if I zoom in you can see each dot

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
here is individually colored I could

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
select on each one and you can see the

133
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,320
color that's applied there there's no

134
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
gradients here each dot is a single

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
individual

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
color and that should do it for this

137
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,199
tutorial that's how you can trace an

138
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,320
image into a series of vector colored

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
dots using inkscape

140
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,800
if you found this lesson useful then

141
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,880
consider checking out my inkscape master

145
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,320
what they are and demonstrate how they

146
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,039
work kind of like how I did in this

147
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
video we even have a private Community

148

Life I'll have some information about

153
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,600
