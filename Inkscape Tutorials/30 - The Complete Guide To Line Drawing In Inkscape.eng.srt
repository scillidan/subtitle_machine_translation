1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:01,920
in this tutorial we'll be going over

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,240
everything you need to know about

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,319
drawing lines in inkscape so getting us

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,119
started let's first go over how you can

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,400
draw simple straight lines to do that

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,080
we're going to use the pencil tool which

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,200
could be located over here in your

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,519
toolbar or you can access it by pressing

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,960
the letter P on your

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,160
keyboard when you have the pencil tool

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,480
enabled you'll notice up here in the

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,000
tool settings we have these three

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
different modes that we can work with

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,240
these are the different types of lines

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,599
that you can draw and in this lesson

16
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,560
we'll be going over all three but let's

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,920
first focus on this setting right here

18
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,800
which allows us to draw simple straight

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,079
lines so to draw your straight line all

20
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,120
you have to do is Click once to add a

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,480
point and then move your cursor wherever

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,520
you would like the line to be and then

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,280
click again to add another point and now

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,480
we have a simple two-point line as you

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,000
can see there if you want to continue

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,800
drawing this line all you have to do is

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
connect back to one of these nodes and

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,960
click move your cursor wherever you

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,440
would like the next line to be placed

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,359
and click again and now we have a single

31
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,960
three-point line that follows a Bend

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
here so let's say you want to draw

33
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
straight lines that follow a perfect

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,080
vertical or horizontal path all you have

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,040
to do is click to add your point and

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
then while placing your line hold the

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
control key on your keyboard and if you

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,439
bring your cursor down and up you get a

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,280
perfectly vertical line or if you bring

40
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,840
it left and right you get a perfectly

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,119
horizontal line and you can rotate it

42
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,119
around like this to place your line in

43
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,960
15Â° increments so I'm going to create a

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,000
vertical line right here click to add

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,960
the point and I'm going to continue

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,439
drawing straight lines down here I'm

47
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,799
going to hold I'm going to hold control

48
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,280
and draw a horizontal line now and then

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,159
I will draw one more line up here back

50
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,119
to the starting point and we end up with

51
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
something like that right there so let

52
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,000
me get rid of that and show you what

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
else this Bode can do so going back to

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,439
the pencil tool another thing you can do

55
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,960
with this tool is draw freehand lines so

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,719
if I click and drag like that you'll

57
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,520
notice we get a scribbled line that

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,759
follows my hand movement so this would

59
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,119
be useful if you're creating something

60
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,799
like a signature or maybe if you're

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,640
using a stylus or a pen and you're want

62
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,079
and you want to draw calligraphy or

63
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,680
something like that that would be a good

64
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,598
mode to use for that the problem with

65
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,560
using this pen mode though is that it's

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
hard to get really smooth lines so let's

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,519
say I wanted to draw a curse of letter L

68
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,000
like that this does not look very fluid

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,080
because it follows my hand movement and

70
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,519
my hand isn't perfectly stable so this

71
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,480
is where these other pen modes come in

72
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,200
handy I'm going to click on the Spyro

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,560
option now this middle option right here

74
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,640
that says create spiral path this makes

75
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,840
it so that the freehand lines you draw

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
follow a much more fluid Contour so if I

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
were to draw that same letter L over

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,280
here I get a different output over here

79
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,200
it looks much more smooth in fluid now

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,319
to show you what I mean even more let me

81
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,920
change the size of this so we can see

82
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,959
this line better and I'll do the same

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,360
thing to this line over here I'll make

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,640
this bigger as well I'm going to change

85
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,319
the stroke size to

86
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,519
seven now I'm going to select this line

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,440
right here and I'm going to grab the

88
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
nodes tool and if you know notice the

89
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
blue path on there represents the line

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
that I drew but the black line

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,799
represents smooth path that was created

92
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,760
so if I move these nodes around I can

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,440
change the Contour of the line but it

94
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
stays smooth the whole time it never

95
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,640
it's never not smooth it remains pretty

96
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,640
fluid as you can see there so that isn't

97
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
exactly the case over here if I click on

98
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,360
these handles over here you don't really

99
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,480
get that smoothness maintained you have

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,519
more control from these handles this is

101
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,239
better for creating accurate lines but

102
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,159
this is better over here for creating

103
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,720
really smooth

104
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,200
lines so let's go over that final option

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,599
now I'm going to go back to the let me

106
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,040
deselect everything and go back to the

107
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,280
pencil tool and we have this final

108
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,000
option over here which is creating Beast

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
blind paths now this is more useful when

110
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,799
it comes to using the bezier pen which

111
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,680
we'll go over in just a minute but this

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
does work with the pencil as well so let

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
me show you how this works this also

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,239
allows you to draw smooth lines but it

115
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,000
gives you more control over the nodes

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,640
afterwards so if I change the size of

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
this let me make this seven again I can

118
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,439
come over here to the nodes tool and if

119
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,079
you notice we have this path that we can

120
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,959
edit but the lines are drawn using

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,319
straight lines for the path and then the

122
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,560
actual stroke itself follows a curved

123
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,639
line so this the trade-off you're making

124
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,320
here this is not as fluid as this option

125
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,399
over here but this option over here

126
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,400
gives you more control over where

127
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,240
exactly you can place the Contours of

128
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,960
the line This option over here gives you

129
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,759
smoother lines but it's kind of hard to

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
really control where the lines get

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
placed because it's always making sure

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,840
that the lines were made smooth now

133
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,560
let's go over how you can draw lines

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,919
using the be pen which is located over

135
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,960
here in your toolbar or you can access

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,280
it by pressing the letter B on your

137
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,039
keyboard and when you have this tool

138
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,560
enabled up here in the tool settings you

139
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
notice we have the three same settings

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
that we had previously in the pencil

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,080
tool in addition to these other two so

142
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,639
let's go over what all of this does Now

143
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,320
to create straight lines with the bezi

144
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
pen all you have to do is click to add a

145
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,759
point just like the PC tool but the

146
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,800
difference is that as you add points the

147
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,880
line does not end the line goes on as

148
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,400
long as you'd like it to go on so this

149
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,039
is ideal for drawing one long continuous

150
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,120
line as you can see there and this line

151
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
does not end until you either connect

152
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
back to the starting point or you press

153
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
enter on the keyboard to end the path

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,520
like that and another thing that you can

155
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,800
do with this mode is you can also draw

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
curved lines in addition to the straight

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
lines so if I were to draw a straight

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
line like this and make it vertical and

159
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
click to add my point I can come up here

160
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,720
and I can click and drag to add my point

161
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
and as I'm clicking and dragging it

162
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,600
curves the line as you can see there and

163
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,080
then you could bring the other side down

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,759
like this over here bring this line

165
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,440
straight down and connect it back to the

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
starting point and now we end up with

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,919
this Pac-Man sort of shape right here

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,639
now the problem with drawing curved

169
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,039
lines in this method is that there's a

170
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,039
pretty steep learning curve with this

171
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,479
sort of method it's really hard to

172
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,639
create accurate lines that follow the

173
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,360
the Contour that you want so this is

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,479
where these other modes come in handy so

175
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,160
let me get rid of all of this

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,520
here and I'm going to choose the spiral

177
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,759
path now now if I click to add my points

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
it's creating an automatic spiral path

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,599
as you can see there and if I draw My

180
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,160
Curse of letter L that I tried with the

181
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
pencil tool earlier I end up with a much

182
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,319
better result here because this allows

183
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,720
me to create more accurate placements of

184
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,199
where the line is clicking and dragging

185
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,039
is always less accurate than clicking to

186
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,639
add individual points and you can see

187
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,400
here we end up with a much better result

188
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,639
so let me make this

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
bigger I'm able to get the proportions

190
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,160
just how I like

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
it and if I grab my nodes tool you'll

192
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
notice we have these editable nodes here

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
the path remains smooth no matter what I

194
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,599
do to

195
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,400
it and then finally over here we have

196
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
let me go back to the pen tool over here

197
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,599
up top we have the be lines this works

198
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,960
the same way we're clicking to add

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
points and it's creating a curved line

200
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
although we're drawing a straight path

201
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,599
we're drawing straight lines indicated

202
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
by the Blue Line there and then the path

203
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,360
being

204
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,879
drawn is curved so I can press enter

205
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,759
like that and the downside with this is

206
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,360
that the path isn't as smooth but the N

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
the nodes are easier to control same

208
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,000
with the pencil tool it just gives you

209
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
more control over these nodes here like

210
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,840
that let me make this bigger so you can

211
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,759
see it

212
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,599
better and there you go now another

213
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,720
thing that you should keep in mind when

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,759
using this mode this is actually one of

215
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,599
the best modes to use with the pen tool

216
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,120
I use this more than anything because

217
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
not only can you draw curved lines

218
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,280
easily you can also create straight

219
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
lines as well if you hold the shift key

220
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,759
so I'm going to hold shift and click to

221
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,639
add a point and now we have a corner

222
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,120
node there and if I hold shift again and

223
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,400
control I can draw a straight line like

224
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,840
that and now we have a combination of

225
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,680
straight lines and curved lines as you

226
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
can see there and this is actually the

227
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,680
tool that I use whenever I'm tracing a

228
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,159
subject to create a silhouette or

229
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,039
something like that I'll put a uh a

230
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,319
little video up on the screen here so

231
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,000
you can see what I mean this allows you

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,599
to create nice smooth fluid lines that

233
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,759
follow what you're tracing accurately

234
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,120
while also allowing you to create

235
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,800
straight lines to go with it so let me

236
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,960
get rid of all this and let's go over

237
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,759
these final two modes right here this

238
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,720
one right here is for creating only

239
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,440
straight lines so if I select this pen

240
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,720
mode right here it's only going to draw

241
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,479
straight lines now you may be wondering

242
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,520
what the point of this mode is because

243
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,080
the original pen mode lets you draw

244
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
straight lines as well well the

245
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,319
difference is that with this tool you

246
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,720
can't accidentally draw curved lines so

247
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,199
if I click and drag it's not going to

248
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
draw curved line it's always going to be

249
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,599
a straight line as you can see there now

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,799
if I go back to my original pen mode and

251
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,799
I click like that if you click ever so

252
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,519
slightly you end up with a very slight

253
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
Bend in that line there even if you

254
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
can't see it it's there and you could

255
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
see by the handles if there's a handle

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,839
showing there you'll notice it's a

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
curved line so this is actually a

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,959
problem when you're trying to draw

259
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,279
straight lines with this pen mode

260
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,920
sometimes you'll accidentally create a

261
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
curved line without realizing it when

262
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
you really need a straight line so this

263
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,920
is when this mode up here comes in handy

264
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,560
and then finally we have this setting up

265
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,519
here which is for drawing parallel lines

266
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,200
so if I if I choose this option and

267
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
start drawing my lines you'll notice

268
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,399
every line that I draw goes parallel to

269
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,839
the original line that I drew so this

270
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,320
could be really useful if you're doing

271
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,920
something like drawing a floor plan or

272
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
tracing over something that where you

273
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,519
need to keep the angles preserved just

274
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,720
like that and you can connect it back to

275
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,160
the starting point as you can see there

276
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
if I start off drawing a perfectly

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
horizontal line it's going to make it so

278
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
that every line that I draw is vertical

279
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,560
and horizontal like that so this could

280
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,279
actually be really useful if you're

281
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
doing something like tracing over a

282
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
Skyline and you want to create like

283
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,839
buildings like that it ensures that you

284
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,079
never draw any kind of curved path at

285
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:47,079
all so those are all of the ways in

286
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,000
which you can go about drawing lines in

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

288
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,920
then consider checking out my inkscape

289
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,240
master class it's a collection of over

290
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,040
60 videos where I go over all of the

291
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
tools and features in inkscape and I

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,600
explain what they are and demonstrate

293
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
how they work kind of like how I did in

294
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,480
this video we even have a private

295
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,120
Community where you can ask questions

296
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,519
and get help from me anytime you want

297
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,240
and best of all there's no monthly

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
membership fees you just pay $17 one

299
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
time and you're in for Life I'll have

300
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
some information about that down below

301
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
