00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,849
Inkscape recently introduced version 1.0

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,650
as a new release and this was not your

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,960
typical update this new release comes

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,789
packed with lots of new features and

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,830
functionality that might make your life

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,320
a little easier as an Inkscape user I'll

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,850
have a link in the description to the

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,710
wiki page with a complete list of all

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,359
the new features and updates added if

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,980
you want to check that out but in this

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,900
video I'd just like to go over a few of

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,340
those features that I'm really excited

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,230
about in particular and if you are

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,000
enrolled in my Inkscape masterclass I

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,710
have updated the course contents

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,840
according to the new release and if

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,129
you're not enrolled maybe consider

19
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,360
checking it out if you want to learn

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,190
more about Inkscape I'll have a link in

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,539
the description for more information

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,260
about that as well

23
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,830
to get us started Inkscape has

24
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,660
officially added support for theme

25
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,030
customization gone are the days where we

26
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,830
had to tinker with system files and

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,200
perform other types of voodoo magic just

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,030
to get a more visually appealing dark

29
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,550
theme with a more modern icon pack it's

30
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,800
now built right in you can just navigate

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,800
to edit preferences and click on theme

32
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,020
under the interface tab and from there

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,760
you can choose from a variety of themes

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,650
and yes that does include a dark theme

35
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,630
not only that but you can also switch to

36
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,760
a more modern icon pack with the

37
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,830
monochromatic style that looks more like

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,080
it belongs in the year 2020 you can even

39
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,820
go as far as changing the color of those

40
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,170
icons if you so desire

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,100
one new feature that I'm really excited

42
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,740
about an Inkscape version 1.0 has to do

43
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,960
with the text tool if you generate some

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,820
text on your canvas you'll notice that

45
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,649
there's now a little note on the bottom

46
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,720
right side of your text item clicking

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,250
and dragging that node will allow you to

48
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,530
determine where a line of text should

49
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,869
end this will be really useful when

50
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,580
designing things like brochures where

51
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,470
you have to confine your text to a

52
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,750
specific vertical column you won't have

53
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,280
to worry about making the bounding box

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,860
of that text fit that column any longer

55
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,259
you can simply adjust that node to make

56
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,929
your lines of text end exactly where you

57
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,170
want

58
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,980
those of you who use illustrator may

59
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,020
already be familiar with the concept of

60
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,790
outline mode which allows you to view

61
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,800
your design as somewhat of a skeleton

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
where you can see all of the individual

63
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,460
paths and boundaries that make up a

64
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,530
design without fill colors and other

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,870
design elements getting in the way this

66
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,850
is useful because sometimes you need to

67
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,800
select or work with a particular object

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,810
but you can't select it because you

69
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,520
don't know where it is because it's

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,140
positioned beneath other objects with

71
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,210
fill data this is one of the reasons why

72
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,950
I tend to make objects with partial

73
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,210
transparency when I'm designing

74
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,580
something you just need to be able to

75
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,110
know where things are sometimes and

76
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,870
Inkscape has now made that easier with

77
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,580
their own version of outline mode and

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,080
I'll even go as far as saying that

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,730
they've outdone illustrator with this

80
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,470
update because it offers a lot more

81
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,780
versatility the first way you can view

82
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,190
your work in outline mode is by

83
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,020
navigating to the View menu and clicking

84
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,450
on x-ray mode this will allow you to use

85
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,100
your cursor as somewhat of a viewfinder

86
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,260
where you can hover it over specific

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,240
areas of your design to see all of the

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,670
individual outlines the second way you

89
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,500
can view your design is outlines is by

90
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
navigating to the View menu and

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,340
selecting split view mode this will

92
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,019
generate a guide through the center of

93
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:13,500
your screen

94
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,540
that will show how your design normally

95
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,430
looks on one side and how it looks an

96
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,530
outline mode on the other side you can

97
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,180
move the guide around by clicking and

98
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,830
dragging it and you can also change the

99
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,900
orientation and position of your guide

100
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,730
by clicking on the individual arrows

101
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,970
if you open up your align and distribute

102
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,550
menu you'll notice a new icon in the top

103
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,160
left portion of the menu labeled enable

104
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,770
on canvas alignment handles if you hover

105
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,230
your cursor over it enabling that icon

106
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,540
will allow you to align objects directly

107
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,760
on the canvas without having to use the

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,400
alignment menu interface the way that it

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
works is that you select the objects

110
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,450
you'd like to align click on them once

111
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,370
to display the rotation handles then

112
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,200
click on them a second time to display

113
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,780
the new alignment handles then from

114
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,370
there you can simply click on those

115
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,650
handles to align your objects the same

116
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,450
way you normally would in the align and

117
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,730
distribute menu this is a unique feature

118
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,770
that I have not seen anywhere else and

119
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,120
it's one of those things that you didn't

120
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,650
know you needed until you tried it

121
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,130
another new feature that I know I'll be

122
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,470
using a lot is the new offset live path

123
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,899
effect this functions very similarly to

124
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,150
the standard dynamic offset path

125
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,370
operation only with one very big

126
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,199
improvement and that is that it now

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,630
allows you to maintain sharp corners

128
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,340
to see what I mean if you were to

129
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,860
perform a dynamic offset on an object

130
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,810
with sharp corners like a star you'll

131
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,610
notice that the corners become rounded

132
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,009
as you offset the object this is fine

133
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,900
for objects with rounded corners but

134
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,610
it's useless in scenarios where you need

135
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,289
to maintain the sharp corners of an

136
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,960
object my workaround for dealing with

137
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,699
this in the past was to offset the

138
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,530
object by adding a stroke with sharp

139
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,810
corners then convert the stroke to a

140
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,030
path to work with it further now those

141
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,009
days are over thanks to the new offset

142
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,080
live path effect which allows you to

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,509
maintain sharp corners on an object as

144
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,150
you offset it to access the new feature

145
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,009
select the object you'd like to offset

146
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,349
then navigates a path and path effects

147
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,539
to bring up the path effects window then

148
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,310
click on the little plus sign to add a

149
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,380
new path effects and from the path

150
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,110
effects menu search for offset and apply

151
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,539
that then you can grab the edit pads by

152
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,759
nodes tool and use the little node to

153
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,560
offset your object while maintaining

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
sharp corners

155
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,379
excape version 1.0 comes with lots of

156
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,330
welcomed improvements like support for

157
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,550
high-resolution displays if you're using

158
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,889
a 4k monitor you'll actually be able to

159
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,469
see the user interface now there's also

160
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,330
some other subtle changes like in the

161
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,339
way that stroke to path works when you

162
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,080
convert a stroke to a path it now

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,269
retains the fill segment of that stroke

164
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:50,909
as a separate object like I mentioned

165
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,800
earlier there's lots of new updates and

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
details to comb through so be sure to

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,159
check out that wiki page for a complete

168
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,959
overview let me know what you think of

169
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,219
the new version of Inkscape in the

170
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,959
comments below and as always thanks for
