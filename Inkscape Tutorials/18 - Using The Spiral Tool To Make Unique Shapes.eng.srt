1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,680
in this tutorial we'll be going over an

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,679
example of what can be created using the

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,879
spiral tool in inkscape and to show you

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,640
what I mean I have this simple spiral

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,400
path that I started off with and I was

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,240
able to use it to construct this rolled

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,960
sheet of paper icon that you could see

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,839
here and I will be demonstrating how to

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,320
create this entire thing so let me come

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,000
over here into a new document and we

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,240
will get started so the first thing I'm

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
going to do is grab my spiral tool which

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,400
is located over here and the tool

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
settings I want to use I already have

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,679
inputed into my input boxes here so go

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,880
ahead and pause the video and type in

17
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,480
these values into each of these three

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,960
boxes here we want 2.9 2.0 and

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
0.550 and once you do that you'll be

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
good to get started so now what I will

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
do is I will hold the control key and

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,960
click and drag to the right to create a

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,000
spiral and the way that I want this

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
spiral positioned I want the tail of the

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
Spiral on the right hand side I want

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,559
that to rest on the horizontal plane so

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,440
that it's going up vertically like that

28
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,800
we don't want it offc Center like that

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
we want it placed just like that and

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
that's the result we're looking for and

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,239
now I'm going to convert this to a path

32
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,519
so I'll come up here to where it says

33
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,439
path and I will go to object to path and

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,479
I'm going to grab my selection tool and

35
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm going to flip this vertically by

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,200
pressing this button right here that

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,799
says flip uh object vertically or you

38
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,280
could just press the letter V on your

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
keyboard and that works as well and I'm

40
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,079
going to zoom in on this and I'm going

41
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,640
to click on it again to get the rotation

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
handles I'm going to rotate this around

43
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,240
a little bit just so that this tail

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
right here is not too far up we don't

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,119
want that too far up like that we want

46
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,920
this down a little bit and that looks a

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,520
lot better so what I'm going to do now

48
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,320
is first of all come up here to the tool

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
settings menu if you hover your cursor

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
over this first of four icons right here

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
it'll say when scaling objects scale the

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,960
stroke width by the same proportion make

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,880
sure you have that turned off right now

54
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,560
we want that disabled and once we do

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,640
that I'm going to come back over here to

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,360
my object click on it again to get back

57
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,200
to my scaling handles and I'm going to

58
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
take this bottom Arrow icon right here

59
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,439
and just scale this up like that so we

60
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,640
have this distorted effect as you can

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,240
see here and once we've done that I'm

62
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,119
just going to click on it again I'm

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,000
going to rotate this a little bit more

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm not quite happy with how that looks

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,319
all right that looks a lot better and

66
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,519
now I'm going to open up the fill and

67
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,000
stroke menu so come over here to where

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,840
it says path or No Object and go to fill

69
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,080
and stroke and the menu should open up

70
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,239
over here on your right hand side of

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,000
your screen I'm going to select the

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
stroke style Tab and I want to change

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,840
the width of the stroke from one pixel

74
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
to five pixel

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,879
pixels and I want to make the caps

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,560
rounded as well and then I want to come

77
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,440
down here and bring the opacity of this

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,760
down in half this is just going to make

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
it easier for us to see what we're

80
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,200
working with as we move

81
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
forward so we now have the top portion

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,120
design so what I'm going to do is I'm

83
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,560
going to right click this and go to

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,280
duplicate and I'm going to hold the

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
control key and move this down here like

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
this this is going to represent the top

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,239
of the roll of paper and this is going

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
to represent the bottom if I could show

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,319
show you what I mean here this is the

90
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,200
shape we're starting off with and this

91
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
is what we're putting it we're putting

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,159
it down there like that and now what I

93
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,560
will do is let me click off of that to

94
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,080
deselect it I'm going to turn on

95
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
snapping I'm going to come over here to

96
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,680
this magnet icon and enable that let me

97
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,200
expand this menu and we don't want

98
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,920
advanced mode if you're in advanced mode

99
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,080
just come over here to where it says

100
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,440
reset to simple snapping mode and the

101
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,799
two options we want enabled in simple

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,000
mode are bounding boxes and nodes and

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,920
we're going to keep alignment turned off

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,560
so now I'm going to grab my bezier pen

105
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,439
which is located over here or the pen

106
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,280
tool as it's called and I'm going to

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,760
come over here and I'm going to snap to

108
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,480
the left side of this spiral and let me

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,360
zoom out I'm going to bring the line

110
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,519
straight down I'm going to hold my

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,239
control key to lock it onto the vertical

112
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,599
axis and then snap to the left edge of

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,480
the other shape like that and press

114
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,640
enter and now we want to give this

115
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,400
stroke the same style so let me change

116
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
this to five pixels and I'll make these

117
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
caps arounded as well and I'll bring

118
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,200
down the opacity of that in half and you

119
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,959
can see why I'm turning down the opacity

120
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,159
I want to be able to see where this line

121
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,040
lines up with the other path with the

122
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
spiral path I want to make sure

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
everything there is nice and lined up

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,959
and having partial opacity makes it easy

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,360
to see through these objects while you

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
do that so now let's create another line

127
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,798
going over here let's connect this top

128
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,798
part to this bottom part over here I'm

129
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:20,918
going to hold control bring this

130
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,080
straight down and then snap it onto the

131
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,639
path right there and press enter to

132
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
create the line I'm going to make the

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
width five pixels make the Caps rounded

134
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,600
and bring the opacity down in half like

135
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,520
that and now we have the right side in

136
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,880
place okay so I'll just zoom in to make

137
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
sure everything looks correct here we

138
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,840
want this nice and smooth we don't want

139
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,120
anything off

140
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,199
center and now I'm going to do the same

141
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,600
thing over here let me snap to this

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
piece bring this straight down by

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,320
holding the control key snap to the

144
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,160
bottom part click again and press enter

145
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
I'm going to make this five

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
pixels make the caps rounded bring the

147
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
opacity down and I'll do the same thing

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,479
over here I'll snap to the right Edge

149
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,039
bring the line straight down by holding

150
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,320
control there we go let me change the

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,199
style of this one as

152
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,680
well and it's starting to come together

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
as you can see we now have to get rid of

154
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,360
this bottom piece down here so uh

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
there's various ways we can get rid of

156
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800
this bottom piece down here the way that

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm going to do this is I'm going to

158
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,319
grab my select tool I'm going to enable

159
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,080
the ruler on my canvas by pressing

160
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
controlr on the keyboard if you're using

161
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,319
Mac it would be command R so I'm going

162
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,520
to press command R and now we have the

163
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,039
ruler and I'm going to come up here to

164
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,600
the horizontal ruler and click and drag

165
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
to pull a guide down and I'm going to

166
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,800
snap that guide right where the end

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
point of this vertical line is and now

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm going to select this path right here

169
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,280
and I will grab my nodes tool and I will

170
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,440
double click right there to add a new

171
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
node and I'll make sure that Noe is

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
selected and I want to come up here to

173
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
where it says uh not join selected we

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
want this one right here break path at

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
selected nodes and that's going to break

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
that up into separate

177
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,039
pieces and now I'm going to grab my

178
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,680
select tool I'll go to path and I will

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,039
select break

180
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,759
apart deselect it by clicking off onto

181
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,960
the canvas and I'm going to take this

182
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,400
piece and just press delete to get rid

183
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,479
of it and then I will get rid of the

184
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,199
guide I'll press I'll click on the guide

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,520
hover the cursor over it until it

186
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
highlights red press the delete key to

187
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,440
get rid of the guide and now I will get

188
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,520
rid of the ruler as well by holding uh

189
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,560
command and pressing r or controlr if

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,400
you're on Windows or Linux so a lot of

191
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,560
this is in place now all we have to do

192
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,199
now is create these lines of text or

193
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,639
what are supposed to be lines of text

194
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,919
and then we'll fill this in with some

195
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,720
color so let me uh let me click on this

196
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,919
object up here the original spiral path

197
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,039
I'm going to right click that and go to

198
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
duplicate and I'll hold control and

199
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
bring this straight down like this let's

200
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
turn off snapping now we don't need that

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,360
anymore and I just want to I just want

202
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,280
to take this segment right here and use

203
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,879
it that so let me grab the rectangle

204
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,800
tool and I'll click and drag and create

205
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
a rectangle over that portion of the

206
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
Spiral right there we just want to take

207
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,800
this selection and then I'll select both

208
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,720
of those and I will go to path and

209
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
select cut path and that should break it

210
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,720
up into separate pieces and now we can

211
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,199
just take this piece right here and get

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,039
rid of that and get rid of this piece

213
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
right here as well and let me move this

214
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,599
up I'm going to hold control while doing

215
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,759
this so that we lock it onto the

216
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
vertical axis and I'm going to duplicate

217
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,800
this instead of right clicking and going

218
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,039
to duplicate I'm just going to press

219
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,560
contrl D or command D if you're on Mac

220
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,120
and then I'll take this duplicate copy

221
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
and move that down and I'm going to

222
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
repeat this I'm going to select both of

223
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
these control D to duplicate bring them

224
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,240
down here and I'll do this maybe one

225
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,319
more time bring these ones down

226
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,360
here and now we want to make sure that

227
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
these lines are evenly spaced so let me

228
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,479
select all of them and I will open up my

229
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,639
aligned distribute menu you can access

230
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,800
that by going to object and selecting

231
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,319
aligned distribute I already have mine

232
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
open over here in my dock dockable menu

233
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,479
so I'll just click on that and the

234
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:06,919
option I'm looking for over here where

235
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,840
it says distribute we want to choose

236
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,720
this option right here that says even

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,039
vertical gaps and when I click on

238
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
that it makes everything spaced apart

239
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
evenly and what we could do now is I'm

240
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,479
just going to adjust this a little bit

241
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,960
what we could do now is we can combine

242
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
all of these Strokes together so that

243
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,280
this becomes one shape so I'm going to

244
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,520
select everything and I will go to path

245
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,360
and select combine

246
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
and once you do that you can come back

247
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,799
over to your fill and stroke menu and we

248
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,399
can bring the opacity all the way up and

249
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,159
if you want you can make the stroke

250
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
larger another way that you can make the

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
stroke larger is that you can just scale

252
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
this down I'm going to hold control and

253
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,279
scale this down and since we have this

254
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
setting disabled as we scale the object

255
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
the stroke size will stay the same so if

256
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
you want a heavier stroke you can scale

257
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
this down like that and you could see

258
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
the result as it's happening and once

259
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,720
you're happy with the thickness of the

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
stroke let's enable this setting again

261
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,680
so so that now we can enlarge this

262
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,519
object without losing those

263
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,279
proportions and I'm actually going to

264
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,640
adjust that a little bit I don't want it

265
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
that

266
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,760
heavy okay that looks a little better so

267
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
all that's left now is to color this

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,519
thing in so let me zoom in on this a

269
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,240
little bit and I'm going to come over

270
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,680
here to my stroke paint Tab and I'm

271
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,079
going to give this a dark blue color

272
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll come over here to the original

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,880
design you can see how I colored it here

274
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
this is I'm going to go for something

275
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,920
similar right here I mean obviously you

276
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,680
can color this however you'd like I'm

277
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,200
just going to go with this blue theme

278
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,680
I'll make this a little

279
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,000
darker and I want to fill in these empty

280
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,120
areas here using the paint bucket tool

281
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,920
so let me grab the paint bucket tool and

282
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm going to click on this area right

283
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,240
here to fill it in and I'm going to

284
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
change that color to something else oops

285
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
that was the wrong thing let me press

286
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,040
control Z I want to choose the fill tab

287
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,360
not the stroke paint tab there we go let

288
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,240
me make this a different

289
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
color I'll go with a lighter shade of

290
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,959
blue and I'll come over here and fill

291
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,839
this in as well I'll make this a

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,240
I don't know why it's applying a stroke

293
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
let me get rid of that there we go I'll

294
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
take this and I'll make this one a

295
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
little

296
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,600
darker maybe I'll put a little more blue

297
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
in

298
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,640
there and then I'll do this one more

299
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,440
time I'll fill that one in and I'll make

300
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,560
this one the darkest of them all so let

301
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,240
me make it a little

302
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
darker and I'm actually going to make

303
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,279
this stroke a little darker as well to

304
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,279
accommodate these uh other colors and

305
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,680
once that's done we want to raise this

306
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,000
to the top so I'm going to press this

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
button over here that says raise to the

308
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,240
top we want that we want the stroke

309
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
object on top of everything else on top

310
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
of the fill objects and we could zoom

311
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,200
out and you can see we are finished so

312
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,880
that's an example of what you can do

313
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,040
using the spiral tool in inkscape if you

314
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,760
found this lesson useful then consider

315
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,279
checking out my inkscape master class

316
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
it's a collection of over 60 videos

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
where I go over all of the tools and

318
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
features in inkscape and I explain what

319
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,519
they are and demonstrate how they work

320
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,440
kind of like how how I did in this video

321
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,160
we even have a private Community where

322
