1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,460
so as you may already know you can

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,560
change the colors of objects in inkscape

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,660
by clicking on them one by one and

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,220
applying fill colors

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,900
but what if you wanted to change an

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,120
entire range of colors all at once so

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,559
that you get a more consistent result

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,599
like this while saving yourself a bunch

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,619
of time

10
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,840
this is where the hsl adjustment

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,640
extension comes in handy and in this

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,260
tutorial we'll be going over how you can

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,340
use it

14
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
so to get started I have this example

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,640
design here on my canvas it just

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
consists of individual Vector objects

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,779
I'm going to click and drag over all of

18
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,279
them to select them and group it all

19
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,320
together by going to object and

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,360
selecting group

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,300
now I'm going to open up my extensions

22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,460
menu over here I'll come down to where

23
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,280
it says color and I will select hsl

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,899
adjust

25
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,780
let me bring this menu over here now hsl

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,239
stands for Hue saturation and lightness

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,160
to show you how this works let me turn

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,379
on the live preview

29
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,300
first I'll show you what saturation and

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
lightness does and then I will explain

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,739
you so saturation is the intensity of

32
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,359
the color so if I bring this all the way

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,720
up we have more vibrant intense colors

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,060
if I bring this all the way down

35
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,159
the colors become more muted and if I

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,140
bring it all the way down like that we

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,420
end up with an almost or a black and

38
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,979
white image as you can see there in that

39
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,060
grayscale

40
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,119
let me set this back to zero

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,460
lightness represents the lightness of

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,560
the color so if I bring this up we end

43
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
up with the lighter result like that or

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,880
if I bring this down we end up with a

45
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,560
darker result like that

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,140
so let me reset that as well

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,420
and then finally Hue is what you would

48
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,820
use to change the actual color so if I

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,439
move this over here

50
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,420
we end up with this color or if I move

51
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,400
this down more we end up with that color

52
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,860
and as you go up and down this scale

53
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,079
here you can run through the entire

54
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,180
gamut the entire range of colors you can

55
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,799
make this object virtually any color

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,320
that you want you can use green blue or

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,420
whatever and the thumbnail of the video

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,399
I used a pinkish purple so I will use

59
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,500
something like that right there and then

60
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,939
you can if you want to you can change

61
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,740
the saturation to increase the the

62
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,079
intensity of that color

63
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,818
and then finally over here you can use

64
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,560
your lightness to adjust that if you

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,140
want I think this looks better

66
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,140
with a modest lightness like that and

67
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,940
once you're finished click the apply

68
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,879
button once and I say once because once

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
you click it nothing visibly is going to

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,239
happen on your screen well nothing

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,860
nothing's going to change that you can

72
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,900
see anyway but the changes are now

73
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,000
applied and if you click that button

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,099
again it's going to apply those changes

75
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,660
a second time so you'll end up with a

76
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,160
different result so that's one thing to

77
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,260
keep in mind click that button once and

78
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,900
once you click it close out of the menu

79
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,000
and now if I ungroup these objects and

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
select them one by one you can see their

81
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,500
colors have indeed been changed this is

82
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,959
not a temporary filter or some kind of

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
adjustment layer these are actual

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,160
changes that have been applied to the

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,780
subject as you can see there

86
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,300
so that is how you can change colors

87
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,879
globally using the hsl adjustment in

88
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,459
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

89
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,319
then consider checking out my inkscape

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,540
master class it's a collection of over

91
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,459
60 videos where I go over all of the

92
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,319
tools and features in inkscape and I

93
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,940
explain what they are and demonstrate

94
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,860
how they work kind of like how I did in

95
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
this video we even have a private

96
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,340
Community where you can ask questions

97
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,500
and get help from me anytime you want

98
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,659
and best of all there's no monthly

99
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,599
membership fees you just pay 17 one time

100
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,700
and you're in for Life I'll have some

101
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,200
