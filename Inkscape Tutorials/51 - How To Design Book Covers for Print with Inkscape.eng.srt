00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,960
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,120
you can design your own book covers

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
using inkscape and i don't just mean a

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
book cover for an ebook i mean an actual

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,119
physical book cover that you would print

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,039
and use on a book as you can see here in

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,039
the mock-up before we get started though

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,560
if you'd like to learn everything that

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
there is to know about enscape

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,840
be sure to check out my inkscape master

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
class it's a collection of over 60

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,800
videos where i go over

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,239
all of the tools and features in

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,079
inkscape and i explained what they are

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,520
and demonstrate how they work

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,719
i'll have a link in the description of

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800
the video if you want to check that out

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,719
okay so as you can see here i've opened

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,480
up the kindle direct publishing

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
uh this is there this is amazon's print

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
on demand service for uh having your own

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,719
books

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
printed i'll be showing you how to use

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,079
this service here because this is the

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,680
one that people most commonly use when

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,879
they have books printed

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,480
in order to design your book cover with

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,320
inkscape you first have to come here and

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,760
download a template

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
for the size of book you'd like to print

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,400
so if you notice over here we have all

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
these different sizes to choose from we

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
have a page count to choose from and we

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,000
have

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
color options to choose from for the

38
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
paper as well for this demonstration

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,000
i'll be showing

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
you how to design a six inches by nine

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
inches book with 200 pages in it

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
with white paper now if you go ahead and

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,600
click the download cover template button

44
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
you should get a zip folder and within

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
that zip folder is a

46
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
dot png file that we will be working

47
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
with in inkscape

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
okay so getting started here in inkscape

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,400
the first thing i want to do is just set

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
up the documents that we all have a

51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,119
similar workflow here

52
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,320
i'm going to come up here and turn off

53
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
snapping i want to change the

54
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,439
units of measurement to pixels and then

55
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,640
i will come up here to where it says

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
view and make sure you have custom

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
selected

58
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,320
and now what i'm going to do is i'm

59
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,640
going to import that png template onto

60
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
my canvas here by just clicking and

61
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,000
dragging it onto the canvas like that

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
now you can't see where this is coming

63
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
from because i have this folder opened

64
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,560
up on my other monitor but if you take

65
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
the dot png file

66
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
and click and drag it onto your canvas

67
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
like that you should get this little

68
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
this little menu that pops up and from

69
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,320
these defaults here we want to make sure

70
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
we have embed

71
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038
from image dpi default import resolution

72
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
and for image rendering mode

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,640
none and once you have those presets as

74
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,239
they are click ok

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,239
and it should import your image as you

76
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,520
can see here now let me zoom out a

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,640
little bit so i can see that a little

78
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,360
better

79
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
you hold ctrl roll down the mouse wheel

80
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
a couple of times

81
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,440
okay so there's our template a couple of

82
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
things about this template

83
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
this image right here represents the

84
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
size that our document needs to be so

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
what i'm going to do is i want to resize

86
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
the document so that it fits

87
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
this image right here now if you notice

88
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
this is the document size right here as

89
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
it stands

90
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
so in order to change that what i'm

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
going to do is i'm going to select the

92
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,920
image

93
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,720
and i'm going to press ctrl shift and r

94
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,680
on the keyboard

95
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
and that's going to change the document

96
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,879
size to match

97
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,480
the size of the selection there as you

98
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
can see there a couple of more things uh

99
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
worth noting about this template over

100
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
here you'll notice this dotted line

101
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,519
going around the edge

102
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
of the image here this dotted line

103
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
represents the bleed cutoff

104
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
once this document is printed everything

105
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
outside of this dotted line will be

106
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
trimmed off

107
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
and then this pink area right here

108
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,360
represents the safe area

109
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
meaning all of your contents of your

110
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
design need to be

111
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
away from this pink area if you have any

112
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
elements like text or imagery that touch

113
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
this pink area or start to bleed out

114
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
into that area

115
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,400
uh amazon will reject your book cover

116
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
design so that's something important to

117
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,959
keep in mind as we're going through and

118
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,080
creating this design you want to make

119
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
sure you keep everything

120
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
in this white space in here now as you

121
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
can see over here on the right

122
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
we have the cover of the book the front

123
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
cover over here on the left we have the

124
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,599
back cover

125
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
and this right here is the spine of the

126
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
book now the way this works is this will

127
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
be printed out as one

128
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
entire document and then just wrapped

129
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
around the book as a single

130
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
a single piece of paper and then over

131
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,239
here we have

132
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
the barcode now when we're designing we

133
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
want to make sure we do not put anything

134
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
over here we do not need to put the

135
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
barcode on the design ourselves amazon

136
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
will handle that themselves all we have

137
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,680
to do

138
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
is make sure that we leave this space

139
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
right here free

140
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
so let me zoom out a little bit let me

141
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
open up the layers menu

142
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
which is located over here you can also

143
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
press shift control l as a keyboard

144
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
shortcut

145
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
and what i want to do is i want to

146
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
rename this layer to

147
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,399
template and i want to create a new

148
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,959
layer

149
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
by clicking the plus button over here

150
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
and i want to name this contents

151
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
all of the contents the design is going

152
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
to be on this layer i want to put this

153
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,199
below current

154
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
and click add so we have the contents

155
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,040
layer where the design is going to be

156
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
and then we have the template layer up

157
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,919
here which we're going to use for a

158
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,000
reference as we're creating our design

159
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,759
now instead of using this template right

160
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,120
here i'm just going to create some

161
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
simple guides to make sure that i'm

162
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,840
staying within these boundaries here so

163
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
the first thing i want to do is let me

164
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
grab the rectangles tool

165
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
and i'm going to create a rectangle

166
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,479
going over the white space right here

167
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
of the back cover and i want to give

168
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
that an outline um

169
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
or a stroke i'm going to hold shift and

170
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
click on the color green to give that

171
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,400
an outline let me remove the fill color

172
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
let me grab the select tool

173
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
i'm going to be moving through these

174
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
steps a little quicker than normal this

175
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,440
is going to be more of like an

176
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
intermediate tutorial because

177
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,199
there's a lot for me to go over in this

178
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
lesson so i'm not going to be explaining

179
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
every single click like i normally do so

180
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
that's something to keep in mind

181
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
let me zoom in over here i want to make

182
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
sure i have this option up here disabled

183
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
where it says when scaling objects scale

184
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
the stroke width by the same

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
proportion have that turned off and i

186
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,039
just want to make sure

187
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
that the edge of this green stroke is

188
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160

to come down here to the contents layer

220
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
and i want to create another rectangle

221
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080

design i made this book cover

225
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
yellow with some white going through

226
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,520

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
i'll make that yellow let me get rid of

230
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
that stroke by holding shift and

231
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
clicking the x

232
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
and i want to make this the same size as

233
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,919
the template that we just copied so to

234
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
do that

235
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
let me go to edit paste size paste size

236
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
and it'll paste the width and height of

237
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,680
that image like that

238
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
and then i just want to align this on

239
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
the artboard here or the canvas so let

240
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,919
me open up the alignment menu over here

241
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
ctrl shift a is the keyboard shortcut

242
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
and i'm going to align this relative to

243
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
the page i'm going to put that on the

244
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
vertical and horizontal axis like that

245
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,360
okay now we'll come back over here to

246
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,199
the layers menu now that we have that in

247
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,080
place

248
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,639
we can select the template layer turn

249
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
the visibility of that back on

250
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
and what i want to do is take this

251
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
template and we don't need this anymore

252
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,199
you could just press delete on your

253
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,560
keyboard and get rid of that

254
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
and as you can see we have the book

255
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
cover design which is the yellow

256
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,639
rectangle

257
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,720
with these guides in place to let us

258
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
know where the important content should

259
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,280
go

260
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
and where we should not be putting any

261
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
content so let me

262
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
lock this layer so that i don't

263
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
accidentally

264
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
move any of these guides as i'm

265
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
designing and there we go now i'm going

266
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
to click on the contents layer

267
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
and now we are ready to start designing

268
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
so as you can see here this book cover

269
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:58,800
is

270
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,639
yellow and i have some white in there so

271
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,160
i'm going to go ahead and create that

272
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,759
aspect of it real quick let me

273
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
take this image right here and duplicate

274
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,520
that by pressing ctrl d

275
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
and i'm going to make this white and i'm

276
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
just going to scale this down like this

277
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
kind of like that now i'm going to grab

278
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,639
my text tool

279
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
and i'm going to put some text in here

280
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
i'm going to write

281
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
how to create a

282
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
now let me change the font i'm going to

283
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
go to text text and font

284
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
and the font i'm looking for is

285
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,759
montserrat obviously you can use

286
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,120
whatever font you'd like i'm just

287
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
showing you how i created this specific

288
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
design i'm going to apply that font like

289
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,479
that

290
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,479
let me scale that up i'm holding ctrl

291
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,279
while i scale to lock the proportions

292
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
place this right about there and i'm

293
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
going to duplicate that control d

294
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
bring that down there and i'm going to

295
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
change

296
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
this to with inkscape

297
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,519
and the text in the middle here is going

298
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
to be a different font let me just make

299
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
sure i have this centered up first i'm

300
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
going to select both of these

301
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
come back over here to the align

302
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
distribute menu and set this to

303
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
last selected and just make sure i have

304
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
that centered up like that

305
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
now if you notice here i have a book

306
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
cover design in the middle here with a

307
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,959
different font so i'm going to go ahead

308
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,160
and create that next

309
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
let me grab my text tool again i'm going

310
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
to write

311
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
book cover design

312
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
there we go let me change the font of

313
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
that to

314
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,279
sirona make sure i have that

315
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,720
centered and i'm just going to scale

316
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
that up as well

317
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
i'm actually going to move this out of

318
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
the way i want to make this i want this

319
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
title to take up the whole width of this

320
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,360
of this uh of this cover right here just

321
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
like that

322
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
let me center that up on there

323
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,320
and let me just change this white stripe

324
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,519
right here to accommodate the change

325
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
in the size of the text like that let me

326
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,560
move this up

327
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,959
move this up now if you notice over here

328
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,800
i also have these little white stripes

329
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
on the top and bottom of each of them so

330
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,519
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

331
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,480
duplicate that

332
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,519
ctrl d move this over here like this

333
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
and just bring down the height of that

334
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
and i'll just duplicate that and bring

335
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
that up there

336
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
and i want to make sure that all three

337
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
of these white stripes are

338
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
spaced out apart evenly so i'm going to

339
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
hold shift and click on each of them

340
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
come over here to align and distribute

341
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
and click on where it says

342
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
make vertical gaps between objects equal

343
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
there we go

344
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
and now i just want to align my text

345
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
again to make sure that it's aligned

346
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
after that change right there and i'm

347
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
just trying to make sure that this is

348
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
centered

349
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
like that i'm going to take this text

350
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,519
and this text

351
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
select them both and then center it up

352
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
with this text just to make sure that

353
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
everything is aligned

354
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,839
in the center like that let me move that

355
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,360
up

356
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,200
there we go okay so what i'm going to do

357
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,600

358
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
is down here all of the secrets of book

359
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
cover design revealed

360
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,360
and then by author name let me add that

361
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
text in there real quick

362
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
and i'm going to give this text a little

363
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
bit of a shear by clicking on it again

364
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
and getting these shearing handles just

365
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
to make it look like it's italics

366
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
because there's no italics version of

367
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,560
this font

368
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
let me just do that there we go and i

369
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
want to make sure i have that centered

370
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
right there

371
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
there we go and then down here finally i

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
your author right here so let me

375
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
i'm just going to use this text item

376
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
right here i'm going to duplicate that

377
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
by author name and i'll make this one

378
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
smaller because this one is less

379
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,760
less prominent there we go put that down

380
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,000
there

381
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
towards the bottom center that up i want

382
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
to make sure i have everything centered

383
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,680
up here so i'm going to click on

384
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
click and drag over all of that make

385
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
sure it's all centered up like that

386
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,079
and i want to make sure it's all

387
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,600
centered relative to the page there

388
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
and what i might want to do is just

389
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
space things out vertically a little

390
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,760
better so let me move this down

391
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
let me move this down i'm going to group

392
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
all of this right here together

393
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
i'm going to just press ctrl g to group

394
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
that together like that

395
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
move this down like this now if you can

396
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,120
see here

397
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
i have the um the inkscape logo up top

398
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
there so let me import that in here and

399
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
place that real quick

400
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
okay so there we go there's the inkscape

401
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
logo and now i'm just going to select

402
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,959
all of these objects or actually you

403
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,160
know what let me make sure i have this

404
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
centered first

405
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
there we go i'm going to select all of

406
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
these objects

407
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
and i just want to space them all apart

408
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
evenly vertically like this

409
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
there we go and maybe move that up a

410
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,160
little bit

411
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
all right we're looking pretty good here

412
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
okay so what i'm going to do now is the

413
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
cover of the book

414
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,320
is now finished i'm going to work on the

415
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
spine now as you can see in the spine

416
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
i have the inkscape logo i have the

417
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,079
author name i have the title

418
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
and then i have some subtext over here

419
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
so let me add that in here

420
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
let me put the escape logo in there i'm

421
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
going to duplicate that by pressing ctrl

422
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
d

423
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
i have to make this small

424
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,959
there we go put that right about there

425
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
and i'm going to put some text right

426
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
here that says the author name

427
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,839
let me just duplicate this text and move

428
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,040
it over here

429
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
and just rotate that around like that so

430
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
that it fits in there

431
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
you may have to scale it down a bit like

432
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
that there we go

433
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,959
now i'm going to put the book title in

434
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,399
this white space right here so i'm going

435
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
to duplicate

436
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
first let me ungroup that i'm going to

437
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
duplicate this design right here i'm

438
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,360
going to

439
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,120
duplicate this text right here and i

440
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
want to put this text all on one line

441
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
like that

442
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,959
oops scale that down

443
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,800
rotate that place this in here

444
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
and scale this down so that it doesn't

445
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
it doesn't touch the green edges right

446
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
here you want to make sure it's well

447
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
within that safe area

448
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
and then just center that up there we go

449
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,160
looking pretty good

450
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

451
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,399
put some subtext down here

452
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
uh let me just duplicate this

453
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
the secrets i'm going to i'm going to

454
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
abbreviate this text so that it doesn't

455
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,360
take up too much space down here

456
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
the secrets of book cover design let's

457
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
see if that works

458
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
okay looking pretty good alright so now

459
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
the spine is finished

460
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
the final step would be to work on the

461
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
back cover of the book

462
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
so i'm going to put some text up there

463
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,959
some placeholder text in the middle and

464
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,560
then about the author

465
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,920
uh down there at the bottom so we'll go

466
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
ahead and get started on that

467
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,079

470
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
put this over here i'll make this a

471
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
little smaller

472
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,320
let me uh change this learn how to

473
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639

478
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,639
and now i'm going to put some

479
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
placeholder text in here some lorem

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,680
let me close out of that and this text

493
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,759
pretty small i got it was generated over

let me select the text with the text

498
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
tool

499
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680

i want to make this uh medium or

501
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,519
semi-bold

502
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,720
make this a little bigger maybe 28

503
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,440
see how that looks maybe a little bigger

504
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,839
than that

505
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,120
36. looking better

506
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
okay that's good enough i'll leave it at

507
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
36. i'll place this over here towards

508
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,759
the top left

509
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
again making sure it's not it's not

510
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,519
going anywhere near that green border

511
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,959
let me go back to the text tool and i'm

512
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,000
just going to take this little node

513
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,959
right here and bring that

514
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
in so that it forces the text within

515
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
this area right here

516
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
and then i will center align that text

517
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
and just to uh let me bring this down a

518
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
little bit

519
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,680
there we go just to make this look a

520
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
little better i'm going to add some

521
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
spacing between these lines because

522
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
something about this text right here is

523
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
just not visually appealing it just

524
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,759
looks like a cluster of text so

525
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
i want to space this out a little bit

526
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
let me grab the text tool

527
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,399
select that and over here uh spacing

528
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
between baselines i'm just gonna

529
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
increase that

530
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,279
there we go that looks a lot better okay

531
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,800
now down here

532
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
bottom left we have about the author and

533
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
some more lorem ipsum

534
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
text so let's go ahead and create that

535
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
and then we'll be done so let me take

536
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
this text let me duplicate that

537
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
and then i'll just take this text over

538
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
here and just duplicate that i'll put

539
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,319
this down here

540
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,079
let me go back to the text tool i'm

541
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,359
going to give this i'm going to align

542
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,679
this to the left

543
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,039
there we go i'll bring this in like this

544
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,400
and i want to make this text smaller

545
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,679
this is less prominent if you're

546
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,559
following

547
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,640
the rules of visual hierarchy here this

548
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,000
here is the most prominent this is

549
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
secondary and then this is

550
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,640
uh down here the least important text

551
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,440
let me uh

552
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
shrink that down let me try 24.

553
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,440
see how that looks okay that looks

554
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,160
pretty good

555
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
i'm gonna get rid of some of these lines

556
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
of text in here so that it's not

557
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
bleeding out into the uh the bleed cut

558
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,280
off

559
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,240
um there we go

560
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
and if you want you could add like a

561
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
little picture right here a picture of

562
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,840
the author and

563
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
you know whatever else you want to add

564
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
in there okay so the design portion of

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
the book cover is finished

566
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
okay so how do we go from here to having

567
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
an actual file that we can send to the

568
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
printers and have printed

569
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,240
what we want to do first is come over

570
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
here to the layers menu and where it

571
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
says template we want to just turn off

572
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
the visibility of that layer we don't

573
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
need that anymore

574
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,720
and what we want to do now is export

575
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
this as a jpeg image so we'll go to file

576
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
and we'll go to export png image it's

577
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,919
labeled as png image but it also allows

578
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
you to export other formats such as jpg

579
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,919
if you're working with inkscape version

580
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
1.1 or later so let's open up the export

581
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
menu

582
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,799
and i want to leave all of the defaults

583
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
as they are the export area we are

584
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
exporting the page

585
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,320
and just leave all of these defaults as

586
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
they are and then just go ahead and

587
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
click on export as and when you click on

588
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
that it's gonna it's gonna ask you to

589
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
choose a location on your hard drive to

590
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,559
save this file to

591
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
and it's also going to ask you to it's

592
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,679
also going to ask you to choose a file

593
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,559
format

594
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
now for this probably a good idea to

595
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
choose jpeg

596
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
so um yeah whenever you're printing

597
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
something jpeg is always better than png

598
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
and once you save that file you should

599
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
be done you should be able to take that

600
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
file that jpeg file that you've exported

601
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
and upload it to kindle direct

602
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,160
publishing

603
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
to have your book cover printed so i

604
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,080
think that should do it for this

605
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
tutorial that's how you can go about

606
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
designing your own book covers

607
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,679
using inkscape if you have any questions

608
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,440
just leave a comment below and as always

609
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:39,840
thanks for watching
