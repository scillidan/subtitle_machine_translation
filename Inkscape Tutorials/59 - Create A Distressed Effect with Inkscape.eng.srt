00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,559
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,080
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,000
you can create this distressed text

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,639
effect

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,800
using inkscape but before we get started

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
if you'd like to learn more about how

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
inkscape works be sure to check out my

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,279
inkscape master class

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,119
it's a collection of over 60 videos

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,800
where i go over every tool and feature

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,680
in inkscape

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
and i explain what it is and demonstrate

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
how it works i'll have a link in the

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,080
description of the video if you want to

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,199
check that out

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,719
so to get us started here in inkscape

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,160
the first thing we want to do is set up

19
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
our document so that we are all working

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,040
with a similar workflow

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,399
to do that i'll come up here to where it

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
says view make sure we have custom

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,520
selected

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
and then go to zoom and where it says go

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,600
to view zoom and we're looking for zoom

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,879
one to one

27
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
like that and for this tutorial we're

28
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,160
going to want to disable snapping which

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,039
is up here this

30
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
icon in the top left hand corner just

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
click on that to disable it

32
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
if you already have it deselected then

33
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
you're good to go and then finally we

34
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
want to open up the fill and stroke menu

35
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,559
which is over here

36
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,000
or you could press the uh you could

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
press ctrl shift and f on the keyboard

38
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
to open that up

39
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
so the first thing i'm going to do is

40
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,720
create some text so let me grab the text

41
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,000
tool over here

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
click on the canvas and for this

43
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
tutorial i'm just going to use a capital

44
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,680
letter g

45
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,439
you can use whatever letter or number

46
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,880
you want though

47
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,479
and i'm going to change the font of this

48
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
i'm going to click on the text editor up

49
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
here this little t

50
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
icon and i'm going to change this to

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,080
league

52
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
gothic you don't have to use this font

53
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
you could use whatever font you'd like

54
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
it should work just fine with this

55
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,680
tutorial and let me grab the select tool

56
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,799
over here

57
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,280
and let me just scale this up oops not

58
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
like that let me grab this arrow right

59
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,400
here then hold ctrl

60
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
to lock the proportions put this towards

61
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,799
the center of the page scale it up a

62
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,600
little more

63
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
that's looking pretty good and now what

64
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,280
i want to do is convert this from a text

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
object to a path so that we can edit it

66
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,840
further

67
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
to do that i'll go to path object to

68
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,520
path

69
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
and then click on the ungroup button

70
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
over here which is uh this icon that

71
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
says ungroup or you could

72
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
press ctrl shift and g

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
now i will take the opacity and bring

74
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
this down roughly in half

75
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
and in order to give this the distressed

76
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,600
effect we're going to do two different

77
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,399
things to it

78
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
number one we're going to roughen the

79
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
edges so it looks more whimsical

80
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
and number two we're going to add a

81
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
vector texture to the center of the

82
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,480
letter here

83
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,879
so starting first with the the rough the

84
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
roughened edges to do that i'm going to

85
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
grab the edit paths by nodes tool

86
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
and what we're looking at is the number

87
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
of nodes here in the letter if you

88
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,920
notice

89
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
during in this curve over here we have a

90
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
lot of nodes but in this straight line

91
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
we don't have

92
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
very many nodes at all so what we want

93
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
to do is add some new nodes in here

94
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
by double clicking these lines so that

95
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,879
it's more consistent with the rest of

96
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,519
the design

97
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
because the way we're going to roughen

98
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
these edges is by altering the position

99
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
of these nodes using an extension which

100
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
i'm going to show you in just a minute

101
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,560
so

102
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
go ahead and add some new nodes where

103
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
they are needed so that it looks more

104
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
consistent all the way through maybe

105
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
i'll put one here

106
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
another one right here

107
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
and i'd say that's looking pretty good

108
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
right there so we'll go back to the

109
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
select tool

110
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,840
what i want to do now is go to

111
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
extensions modify path

112
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
and click on jitter nodes and i'm going

113
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
to use these presets right here

114
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,560
1.0 1.0 shift node selected

115
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
shift node handles deselected uniform

116
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,879
and go ahead and click live preview to

117
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,920
see how it looks

118
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
now the numbers that you should use here

119
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
depend entirely on the size of your

120
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
letter if you notice here

121
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,000
displacing these two axis at one pixel

122
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
is perfect it looks good right there if

123
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
this were too high let's say if i had

124
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
something like 10

125
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,040
it would look something like that or

126
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,879
that's not that's not that's that's too

127
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,920
much it doesn't even look like a letter

128
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,080
anymore so i want to lower that to 1.

129
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,599
now i'm mentioning this because you're

130
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
probably going to have to use a

131
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
different value

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
other than one in order to get this

133
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,440
result so make sure to play around with

134
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
these numbers a little bit to see what

135
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
gets the best result

136
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,439
what we're looking for is this right

137
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
here where the edges just look a little

138
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
roughened like that that's perfect as it

139
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,360
is so

140
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
i'll click apply then close out of that

141
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
and now we want to do is apply a texture

142
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,680
to this letter

143
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
but i don't want to apply the texture to

144
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,599
the entire letter i want it

145
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
to only be applied to the center of the

146
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
letter here the middle portion so i'm

147
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,439
going to create a duplicate of this

148
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
letter and then offset it

149
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
to make it smaller and then use that as

150
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,238
the reference selection

151
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
for applying the texture so i'm going to

152
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,358
right click this object and go to

153
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,639
duplicate

154
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
and i'm going to make this green just so

155
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,320
we can differentiate it

156
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
and i'm going to come up here to where

157
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
it says path and i'm going to click on

158
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,479
simplify to get rid of some of those

159
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,600
nodes that we added

160
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
and then we'll come over here and go to

161
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
path and i will look for

162
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,479
dynamic offset and now i want to take

163
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
this little node up here and just bring

164
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
this down

165
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
so that we have this smaller version of

166
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,560
the letter

167
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
inside of it like that and that green

168
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
area that's where we want the texture to

169
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,880
be applied

170
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
so let's finalize that by going to path

171
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
object to path

172
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
go back to the select tool and now what

173
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,199
i want to do is import a vector texture

174
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
i will have this linked in the

175
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
description of the video to where you

176
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
can go and download this svg texture so

177
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
you can work with it i'm just going to

178
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
open up the folder here on my other

179
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
monitor and uh

180
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
well i'll show you over here i have this

181
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
open like this i'm going to take this

182
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,120
scratch.svg and i'm just going to click

183
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
and drag that into inkscape like that

184
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,720
and it's going to ask all of this stuff

185
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840
i'm just going to leave the defaults

186
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
click ok

187
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
and there is our let me zoom out a

188
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
little bit to zoom out i'm going to hold

189
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
ctrl and roll down the mouse wheel

190
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
there is our vector texture now let me

191
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
position this over the green area if you

192
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
notice where the red

193
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
and the green are intersecting that's

194
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,639
going to be the area where the

195
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,080
the texture is applied to the letter so

196
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,039
i just want to make sure i have it

197
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,479
positioned where i want it

198
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
that right there looks pretty good so

199
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
i'm going to hold i'm going to click on

200
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
this green letter to select that

201
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,639
and then i'm going to hold shift and

202
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
click on the red texture

203
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,919
and with them both selected i'll go to

204
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
path intersection

205
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
and then i'll hold shift and click on

206
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,680
the letter and go to path

207
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
difference and what we can do now is

208
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,479
bring the opacity all the way back up

209
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,720
and zoom out and as you can see we are

210
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
finished that is how you can

211
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
pretty easily create a distressed text

212
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
effect using inkscape so

213
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
if you have any questions just leave a

214
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
comment below and as always thanks for

215
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
watching

216
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:36,749
