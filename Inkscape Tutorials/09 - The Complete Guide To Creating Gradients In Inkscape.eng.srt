1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,880
in this tutorial we'll be going over

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,159
everything you need to know about

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:05,879
working with gradients in inkscape now

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,359
in this lesson we're going to focus on

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,040
linear and Radial gradients in

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,400
particular but if you want to learn

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,960
about some of the more advanced types of

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,160
gradients in inkscape such as mesh

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,359
gradients and conical gradients I have a

10
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,720
separate tutorial for that that I'll

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,199
have Linked In the description below so

12
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,840
to start us off here a gradient is

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
basically a transition between two or

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
more colors and a good example of that

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,679
would be the sunset graphic in the

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,279
background this sky does not have a

17
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,680
single color applied to it it has a

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,120
gradient applied to it where it

19
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,760
transitions from lavender to this Peach

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,559
sort of shade so let me show you how

21
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,039
this can be accomplished in inkscape I'm

22
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,920
going to grab my rectangle tool and I'm

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,640
going to click and drag on the canvas to

24
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,840
draw a rectangle and then I'm going to

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,440
open up my fill and stroke menu by

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,239
coming down here to this color stripe

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,680
and double clicking

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,079
it when I do that the fill and stroke

29
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,719
menu will open up over here on the right

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
hand side of the screen and Under The

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,120
Fill tab you'll notice we have have

32
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,600
these different types of fills that we

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,680
can apply to an object right now we have

34
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
a solid color applied to the object but

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
if we wanted to apply a a gradient we

36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,960
can choose one of these options over

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
here we have a linear gradient which

38
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
follows a linear or straight path and

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,119
then we have a radial gradient which

40
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,000
follows a circular or round path so let

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,799
me select linear gradient and when I do

42
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,079
that you can see that by default the

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,400
gradient that it applies starts off with

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,600
the original color on the left hand side

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
and then it transitions over to

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,119
transparency on the right hand side now

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm going to grab my gradient tool from

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
the toolbar over here you can also

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,079
access it by pressing the letter G on

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,799
your keyboard and if I click on this

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
handle you can see the color that's

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
applied to this part of the gradient

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,920
over here in the fill and stroke menu

54
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,880
you can see the color code you can see

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,200
the hsl values and then you can see the

56
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,759
colors indexed over here in the stops

57
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,039
menu now if I click on the other end of

58
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,680
this gradient you can see now I have the

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,799
other color selected now this is the

60
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,600
same color but the alpha channel is

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,399
brought all the way down and by the way

62
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,239
if you don't have an alpha channel here

63
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,639
make sure to come up here to this drop

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,640
down and choose hsl from this list now

65
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm going to bring the opacity of this

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
end of the gradient all the way up so

67
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm going to change the alpha channel to

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,800
100 and I'll press enter and I'm going

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
to give this a different color so I'm

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,480
going to click on this side of the

71
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,720
gradient to select it and I'll choose a

72
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,200
different color from my color palette

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,879
down here now by the way you don't have

74
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,200
have to use the color palette if you

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
want you can change the color using the

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,000
color wheel or the hsl

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,959
sliders and once you've chosen your

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
colors you can take these ends of the

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
gradients and move them around if you'd

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,879
like you could just click and drag them

81
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,599
like that and you can move them as if

82
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
they were any other object in fact if

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,080
you hold the control key it'll lock it

84
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,680
onto 15 Dee increments so that you can

85
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
get a perfectly straight gradient that

86
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,480
either goes vertically or

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
horizontally so let me move this back

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
over a little

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,800
bit now if you come up here to the top

90
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
top of the menu you can see we have some

91
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,319
controls in here let's say I wanted to

92
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,000
reverse this gradient I can click on

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,280
that button and it flips the gradient

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
around so that yellow is on the left

95
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
hand side and pink is on the right and

96
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm going to flip it back and it gets

97
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,040
the same effect and then over here we

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,640
have repeat as of right now there is no

99
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,400
repeat applied to this gradient so the

100
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,360
default is none but if I were to change

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
this to a direct repeat you can see what

102
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,799
happens here when the gradient ends it

103
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,959
just starts and stops abruptly and opens

104
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,319
up a new one and this goes

105
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,200
infinitely so let me put this back and

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,239
then the other option is reflected so

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll choose reflected and this repeats

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,760
the gradient as well but it just mirrors

109
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,319
it each time so it's a little bit of a

110
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,000
softer transition so let me set this

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,159
back to none I'm going to move my stops

112
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,840
out a little bit and let's say I wanted

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
to add a new color to this gradient to

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,920
do that all I have to do is doubleclick

115
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,680
anywhere on the path with the gradient

116
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,879
tool so I'll double click right here and

117
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,200
it'll add a new stop to that gradient

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
and if you look over here in your stops

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,079
index you can see all of the colors that

120
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,959
are included in this gradient and we now

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,480
have that one in the middle that was

122
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,280
just added and if you click on that one

123
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,239
to select it you can change the color of

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,879
that as well so I'll make this something

125
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,720
radically different like green just to

126
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,639
show you and you can see we now have a

127
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,519
gradient that transitions from pink to

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,320
Green to yellow and I could take these

129
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,560
stops and move them around as needed and

130
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
this works infinitely you can keep

131
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
adding new stops in here if you want to

132
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,120
to add new parts to the

133
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,720
gradient and if you want to remove them

134
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
all you have to do is just press the

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
delete key so I'll press delete to

136
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,199
delete that one I'll click on that one

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
to select it press delete and then I'll

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
do the same thing over here and then

139
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,199
we're back to our original gradient and

140
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,720
by the way it works the same thing over

141
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
here in this menu you can select these

142
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,039
stops just by clicking on these colors

143
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,479
in the stops index and another thing you

144
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,960
can do is if you want to offset your

145
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
gradient so that one color is more

146
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,680
dominant than the other you can use this

147
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,000
slider up here so let's say I wanted

148
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
more pink in this gradient I could take

149
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,759
this slider and just bring this over and

150
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,000
then it becomes more pink dominant and

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
it works the other way in Reverse as

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,680
well I can take the yellow slider and

153
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,720
bring that

154
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,919
over and there you go now there's more

155
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,440
yellow in the

156
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,639
gradient so now let's have a look at an

157
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
example of when linear gradients would

158
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,199
come in handy getting back to my

159
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,639
original example of the sunset right now

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
the sky just has a single color applied

161
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
to it but if I wanted to make this look

162
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,919
more like a realistic Sunset I would

163
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,160
apply a linear gradient to it so I'm

164
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,680
going to click on the object to select

165
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,199
it and then I'll open up my fill and

166
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,319
stroke menu I'll apply a linear gradient

167
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,479
and I'm going to grab my gradients tool

168
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
and I'm going to select this end of the

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
gradient and instead of letting this be

170
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
transparent I'm going to make this a

171
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
purple shade so another way that you can

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,639
apply colors to your gradient is with

173
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,120
the dropper tool so with this end of the

174
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,319
gradient selected I will press D on my

175
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,280
keyboard to grab my color selector and

176
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,680
then I'm going to sample this color

177
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
right here just to make it that shade of

178
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,800
purple

179
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
and then I'll grab my gradient tool and

180
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll take this stop and bring this up

181
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,520
here and then I'll take this one and

182
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
bring this down and again holding

183
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
control on my keyboard so that it

184
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
remains a perfectly vertical path and

185
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
there you go just like that I was able

186
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,880
to use linear gradients to make this

187
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Sunset look more

188
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
realistic now let's have a look at how

189
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,840
radial gradients work I'm going to grab

190
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,440
my circles and ellipses tool and I'll

191
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
hold control and click and drag to

192
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,919
create a circle and now I'm going to

193
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,800
apply a gradient to it but instead of

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,919
using a linear gradient this time I'm

195
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,160
going to use a radial gradient and when

196
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I click on that you can see what happens

197
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,240
here uh if I grab my gradient tool you

198
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,440
can see that this works almost the same

199
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,919
way but the only difference is that the

200
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,160
gradient is now following a round path

201
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
instead of a linear path and I could

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
take these handles and bring them in

203
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,319
like this and if I do that you can see

204
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
it distorts the gradient but if I want

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
to maintain the aspect ratio while

206
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,599
scaling what I would do is I would hold

207
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,680
the control key or control and shift

208
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,240
rather and it scales both at the same

209
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,479
time time let me try that again though

210
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,000
since I already distorted it the key is

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,800
that you want to hold control and shift

212
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
before you click and drag so I'll hold

213
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,919
control and shift and then I'll click

214
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,599
and drag and now it scales it with the

215
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
aspect ratio

216
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,800
preserved and again this works the same

217
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
way if you want to add new colors in

218
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,599
here you could just double click the

219
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,919
path and with that node selected you can

220
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,680
click on a different color and then it

221
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,400
adds that color to the

222
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,039
gradient so let me undo that let me undo

223
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,360
adding the new stop to the gradient and

224
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,720
I'm going to reverse this gradient up

225
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,919
here I'm going to click on this option

226
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,199
that says reverse the direction of the

227
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,199
gradient and I'm going to select this

228
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,560
option in the middle and I'm going to

229
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
bring the alpha Channel up to

230
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,360
100 and I'll make this one white so I'll

231
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,879
bring this up to 100 as well so that

232
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,039
it's all white and then I'll take this

233
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,159
end of the gradient and I'll move this

234
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,319
up into the right like

235
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
that and then I'll change the offset of

236
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,560
this gradient by adding more white to it

237
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,919
so I'll take this handle and bring this

238
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,319
out a little

239
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
bit

240
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,319
and I'll scale this out some more I'm

241
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,599
going to hold control and shift and

242
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
scale

243
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
up and as you can see we were able to

244
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,639
use the radial gradients to create this

245
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,639
simulated uh I guess you can say it sort

246
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,080
of looks like a sphere or like a

247
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,440
three-dimensional round

248
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
object so now let's go over an example

249
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
of when radial gradients come in handy

250
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
I'm going to use radial gradients to

251
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,120
create a vignette effect over this

252
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,199
graphic here so let me grab my rectangle

253
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,479
tool and I'll click and drag over the

254
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,879
graphic to draw a rectangle that covers

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,399
the graphic entirely and let me get rid

256
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,039
of that Stroke by holding shift and

257
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
clicking the X and I'm going to make

258
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
this all white and now I'm going to

259
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,599
apply a radial gradient to it I'm going

260
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,120
to reverse the gradient so that

261
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,240
transparency is on the inside and white

262
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,360
is on the outside and then I'll scale

263
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,480
the gradient down so that the boundaries

264
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
of it stay or the ends of it stay within

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
the boundary of the

266
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
image and now I'm going to add more to

267
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,920
the I'm going to set an offset favoring

268
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,000
the transparent side of the gradient so

269
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,519
I'll bring that up a little bit so that

270
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,079
you can see more of the image and if I

271
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,839
zoom out you can see what we were able

272
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,480
to accomplish with that there we created

273
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,040
this vignette effect where it looks like

274
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,760
the edges of the graphic have been

275
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,360
softened and faded out so that is how

276
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
you can go about working with linear and

277
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,279
Radial gradients in inkscape if you

278
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,040
found this lesson useful then consider

279
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,519
checking out my inkscape master class

280
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,320
it's a collection of over 60 videos

281
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
where I go over all of the tools and

282
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,839
features in inkscape and I explain what

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,800
they are and demonstrate how they work

284
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
kind of like how I did in this video we

285
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,519
even have a private Community where you

286
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,720
can ask questions and get help from me

287
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,959
anytime you want and best of all there's

288
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,040
no monthly membership fees you just pay

289
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,360
$17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

290
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,680
have some information about that down

291
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,320
below if you want to check that out as

292
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,240
always thanks for
