1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,719
how you can take your initials or any

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,319
series of letters and use them to create

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,599
a logo where the letters overlap each

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,480
other and to follow along with what I'm

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,880
doing here in this tutorial I'm going to

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,920
recommend that you download and install

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,759
this font that I used for this logo

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,800
design because this font works really

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,720
well for this sort of thing so check the

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,920
description of the video for a download

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,039
link to that font and install it before

13
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,640
you launch inkscape and then you'll be

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,320
good to go so let's get rid of this and

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
we'll get started here I'm going to grab

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,159
my my text tool and I'm going to click

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,640
on the canvas and I'm going to use the

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,840
letters c and b for this demonstration I

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,320
found that these letters work really

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,800
well together but this works with pretty

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
much any letter as long as you're using

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,200
this font and I'm going to select the

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,879
letters and I'll open up my text editor

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,920
by going to text and going to text and

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,399
font and the font I'm looking for is

26
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,120
called winner so I'm going to type that

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,800
in and apply it and now we have the font

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,719
applied so let me collapse this menu I'm

29
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,440
going to grab my selection tool and I'm

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,840
going to in increase the size of this

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm going to hold my control key while I

32
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
do that so we can scale it up

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
proportionately and I'm going to place

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
it in the center of the page so now

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
let's convert this from a text object to

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,119
a path by going to path and selecting

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
object to path and then we want to split

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
the letters apart so I'll go back to the

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,479
path menu and I will choose split path

40
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,200
and now we have two separate letters and

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,520
I'll zoom in on this so you can see it

42
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,159
better so what we're going to do here is

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm going to take this letter C and I'm

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,320
going to collapse its height and then

45
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,040
elongate it so that it can intertwine

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
with this letter B here here and to do

47
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,479
that we're going to use the nodes tool

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,439
so let me select the letter and then

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,479
I'll come over to my nodes tool and I'm

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,200
going to click and drag over these nodes

51
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,759
to select them and then I'm going to

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,159
click and drag them down I'm going to

53
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,840
hold my control key while I do that and

54
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,399
click and drag to bring these nodes down

55
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,079
like this we want this letter C to fit

56
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,600
within this letter B uh and in order to

57
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
do that we need to shrink that down now

58
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,119
a problem I'm running into here is that

59
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,119
this part of the design this part of the

60
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,840
letter anyway is starting to collapse in

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,399
on itself so I'm going to move these up

62
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,039
a little bit I'm going to select just

63
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,600
these nodes right here and I'm going to

64
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,520
use my arrow keys to move them up I'm

65
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,159
going to use my up Arrow key and I'm

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
going to count the number of steps that

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,520
I used to move these nodes because I

68
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,360
want to move these nodes over here down

69
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,040
by the same number of steps so I'm going

70
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,599
to press the up Arrow key 1 2 3 four

71
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,040
five six seven

72
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,400
eight 15 times and I'll do the same

73
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
thing down here I'm going to select

74
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,360
these nodes and I'll move them down 15

75
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,920
Steps as well 1 2 3

76
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,440
4 and we do that just to maintain the

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
symmetry tree so let me grab my

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,560
selection tool now and I'm going to move

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,640
this letter over here and put it on top

80
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,160
of the letter B where I would like it to

81
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,040
be and I'll go back to my nodes tool and

82
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm just going to use the nodes tool to

83
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,959
select these nodes and adjust the size

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,280
of this some more so I'm going to hold

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
control while I do this so it locks it

86
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,000
onto the horizontal axis while I move

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,840
these nodes and I'm going to collapse

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
this down a little more what I'm paying

89
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
attention to right here is where the arm

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
of the C intersects with the um negative

91
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,800
space of the letter B here I want the

92
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,560
this to be roughly halfway through so

93
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,120
let me move this up a little bit and now

94
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,599
it looks like it's going about halfway

95
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,959
through and I'll do the same thing to

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
these top nodes over here I'll move

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,239
these ones down and again I'm holding

98
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,000
control the whole time I do this to make

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,239
sure that we're locking it onto the

100
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,400
vertical

101
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
axis and what I'll do now is I'll grab

102
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,680
my selection tool and I will select both

103
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,920
of these letters and I'm going to open

104
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
up my alignment menu by going over to

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,760
object and selecting aligned distribute

106
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
and I want to choose last selected and

107
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm just going to make sure that they

108
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,840
are aligned horizontally and vertically

109
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,000
and then I'll collapse this menu and

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
what we can do now is I'm going to make

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
a duplicate copy of these two letters so

112
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm going to rightclick them and go to

113
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,040
duplicate and I want to make offset

114
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
copies of these so with them selected

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
I'm going to go to path and I'm going to

116
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,239
select outset and that's going to

117
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,840
increase the offset of the letters and

118
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm going to do that a couple of more

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,879
times uh this offset represents the

120
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,360
spacing that's going to be between the

121
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,799
letters when they're overlapping each

122
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,000
other so depending on how large or small

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,599
is you may want to repeat this step a

124
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,360
few more times I'm going to repeat this

125
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,840
one more time I'm going to choose

126
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
outset and maybe I'll do it one more

127
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,319
time just because I have my letters

128
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,360
pretty large I'll go to path outset and

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
now that's looking much bigger than the

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,920
original letters so what we want to do

131
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,358
now is let's click and drag over

132
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,160
everything we want to select everything

133
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
and now we can use the shape Builder

134
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839
tool to morph this into what we want it

135
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,960
to be so I'm going to come over here to

136
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
the shape Builder tool and I'm going to

137
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,639
zoom in on this and I want to make sure

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,759
I have the plus icon selected here the

139
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,039
add option and now I can just click and

140
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,039
drag through the areas of the design and

141
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,880
shape it how I would like it to be

142
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
shaped so I'm going to click and drag

143
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
through this part of the design right

144
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,960
here because I want this part of the

145
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,120
letter B to overlap this part of the

146
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,039
letter c and then I want this part of

147
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,919
the letter c to overlap the letter B

148
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,600
over here and then we get that effect so

149
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll come down here and repeat this but

150
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720
the opposite way I'm going to make this

151
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
part overlap and then I'll make this

152
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
part overlap and then I'm going to click

153
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
on this part right here to highlight it

154
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,560
in blue now it's important that you

155
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,880
highlight everything that you want to

156
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
keep in blue you have to click on it to

157
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,320
highlight it in blue and if you don't do

158
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,639
that it's going to be deleted once

159
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,000
you're finished so everything that's

160
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,720
gray is going to be deleted everything

161
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
that's not blue is going to be deleted

162
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,039
and once you're finished you can press

163
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,039
the check mark button up here and just

164
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,440
like that we have created an

165
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,280
interlocking letter logo using the shape

166
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,880
Builder tool in inkscape if you found

167
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,280
this lesson useful then consider

168
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
checking out my inkscape master class

169
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
it's a collection of over 60 videos

170
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
where I go over all of the tools and

171
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,120
features in inkscape and I explain what

172
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
they are and demonstrate how they work

173
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
kind of like how I did in this video we

174
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,840
even have a private Community where you

175
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,039
can ask questions and get help from me

176
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
anytime you want and best of all there's

177
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
no monthly membership fees you just pay

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
$17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

179
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
have some information about that down

180
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,639
