[Music]

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,410
one of my favorite features in Inkscape

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,940
is having the ability to create a

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,920
document and save it as a template that

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,570
you can launch directly from within

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,210
Inkscape anytime you want this is useful

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,949
because it means you won't have to waste

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,529
time formatting your document every time

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,060
you go to create certain types of

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,980
designs that you may regularly work with

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,050
like YouTube thumbnails channel art

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,019
business cards invoices and so on if you

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,480
go to file new from template you'll see

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,040
a list of templates that are already

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,660
formatted for whatever it is you'd like

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,850
to create and if you're using Inkscape

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,309
version 1.0 or later you can add your

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,500
templates to this library by going to

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,989
file save template and from there you

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,670
can choose a name along with some other

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,170
metadata and whatever it is you're

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,879
currently working on an Inkscape will be

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,399
saved to that library as a template that

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,260
you could launch anytime you'd like all

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,360
you have to do is go to file new from

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,340
template and there it will be because of

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,930
this I've been able to generate a list

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,940
of eleven templates for common design

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,159
items like print-ready business cards

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,470
and trifold brochures with bleed lines

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,720
and dpi already accounted for and in

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,220
this video I'll be sharing them with you

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,930
and just to be clear these are not

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,390
designs these are just blank templates

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,130
that you can load into your template

36
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,930
library and use to create your own

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,850
designs in the description of the video

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,229
I'll have a link to where you can

39
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,790
download a zip folder with these

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,920
templates in them once you open the

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,540
folder you'll see a list of templates

42
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,900
including brochures business cards

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
contact icons for business cards

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,009
Facebook banners Google Ads and so on

45
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,810
like I mentioned earlier all you have to

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,549
do is open one of these files with

47
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,100
Inkscape then go to file save template

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,600
and if you're using an earlier version

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,399
of Inkscape that doesn't yet have the

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,350
same template feature you can simply

51
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,689
navigate to see Program Files

52
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,409
Inkscape share templates and copy and

53
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,700
paste all of the files into that folder

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,860
and the next time you launch Inkscape

55
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,600
you will be able to create a new

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,430
document based on one of those templates

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,860
this method also works for Inkscape

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,570
version 1.0 if you don't feel like

59
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,670
opening each document one by one and

60
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,350
saving it although the pathway is

61
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,940
slightly different for this one navigate

62
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,410
to see Program Files share Inkscape

63
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,270
place I'll have this information posted

64
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,100
in the description as well one thing I'd

65
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,540
like to point out is that some of these

66
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,550
templates may be a little confusing when

67
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,470
you first open them take the brochure

68
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,600
template for example it has separate

69
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,520
layers with boundaries that represent

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,920
the bleed cutoff line another example

71
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,570
would be the business card templates as

72
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,640
you may already know business card sizes

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
differ by countries so I created a

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,540
master file with every size included if

75
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,280
you're unsure of how this works then I

76
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,780
would recommend checking out the PDF

77
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,270
document in the zip folder it has links

78
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,740
to some articles that I've written in

79
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,090
the past where I explained how some of

80
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,010
these templates work in more detail

81
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,260
other templates like the switch banner

82
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,880
for example are more self-explanatory

83
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,980
because it's just a document set to a

84
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,290
specific width and height the templates

85
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,550
are free to download and use however

86
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,870
you'd like without any need for

87
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,790
attribution I'm releasing them into the

88
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,650
public domain so use them however you

89
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,480
want you can even redistribute them if

90
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,780
you'd like

91
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,760
finally if you want to learn more about

92
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,590
how Inkscape perks be sure to check out

93
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,600
my Inkscape course it's a collection of

94
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,520
over 60 videos where I go over every

95
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,260
single tool and feature in Inkscape and

96
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,240
I explain what it is and demonstrate how

97
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,650
it works I'll have a link in the

98
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,700
description if you want to check that

99
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,320
out if you have any questions leave a

100
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,000
