1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,620
you can Arch text in inkscape to create

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,379
this classic athletic t-shirt design

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,120
and if you just want to know how to arch

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,740
text then you could skip to that part of

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,540
the lesson using the chapters in the

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,799
play bar below

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,599
if you do want to recreate this design

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,220
just make sure to download and install

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,960
this font that I'll have Linked In the

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,460
description of the video

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,720
so I'll come over here into a new

13
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,580
document and get started the first thing

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,380
we want to do is add some text so I'm

15
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,480
going to grab my text tool and I'm going

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,859
to click on the canvas and I'm going to

17
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,260
type inkscape

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,880
and then I'm going to click again to

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,200
create another text item and I'm going

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,960
to write the EST date which is 2003.

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
and then I'll come down here and make

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,920
one more text item that has the tagline

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,140
which is draw freely

24
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,640
and once you do that let's go back to

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,680
the select tool let's select all three

26
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
text items and change their font so I'll

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
come up here to text and I will select

28
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,340
text and font

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,920
and from this menu we're looking for the

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
varsity team font as it's called so let

31
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,780
me locate that highlight it and then

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,420
click apply

33
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,939
and now I'm just going to resize my text

34
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,960
items

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
accordingly so I'm going to make this

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,500
one a little bigger I'll keep this one a

37
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,360
little smaller and I'll make this one

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,280
the biggest ad the biggest of them all

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,380
now make sure to hold your control key

40
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,500
while you're scaling to ensure that you

41
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,659
preserve the aspect ratio

42
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,640
and now I'm going to create a rounded

43
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
rectangle to place behind this text here

44
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,020
so let me grab my rectangle tool I'm

45
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,820
going to click and drag over the object

46
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,740
to create the rectangle

47
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,119
and I'm going to use this little round

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,979
handle up here in the top right corner

49
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,020
to round the corners of this rectangle

50
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,360
rectangle ever so slightly

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,340
and then I will grab my selection tool

52
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,380
and place this beneath the text so I'll

53
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,119
click on this button over here that says

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,060
lower selection one step

55
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,340
now I'm just going to size this up

56
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,159
according to the text there

57
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,439
and now I'm going to select both and I'm

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,939
going to align them so let me open up

59
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,439
the Align and distribute menu by going

60
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,540
to object and selecting align and

61
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,280
distribute

62
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,619
and I'm going to choose relative 2 and

63
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm going to align it vertically and

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,740
horizontally

65
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,080
and with the items still selected let's

66
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,099
go to path and select difference and

67
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,540
what that's going to do is subtract the

68
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,940
text from the rectangle and now this

69
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,120
rectangle has empty space in it in the

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
shape of those letters so that any

71
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,120
backdrop that you place it on top of

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,440
will show through where those letters

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,520
are

74
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,319
so let me zoom out I'm going to make all

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,640
of this the same color I'm going to

76
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
select everything here and choose a

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
color that I'd like to work with if you

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,500
want to choose a different color other

79
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
than what you see down here you can open

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
up your fill and stroke menu just double

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,900
click this color stripe over here and

82
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,060
it'll open up the fill and stroke menu

83
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,599
and I'm going to choose my color

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,940
there we go and now I just want to make

85
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,220
sure that everything here is aligned so

86
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,300
I'm going to come over here to the align

87
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,980
the distribute menu and I'm going to

88
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,560
align it vertically and let me make

89
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,319
these items a little closer together

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,700
I'm just going to move them up like that

91
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,980
now again to select multiple objects I

92
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,360
click I click on them while holding

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,340
shift and while I'm moving them I'm

94
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,319
holding the control key to ensure that

95
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,879
they are locked to the vertical axis

96
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,959
there and they do not lose their

97
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,519
alignment

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,280
and once you've done that let's apply an

99
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
arch to this text right here so I'm

100
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
going to click on the text to select it

101
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,739
and I'm going to convert it to a path by

102
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,080
going to path and selecting object to

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
path

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
and now I will open up the pathfx menu

105
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,080
so let's come back up here to path and

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,599
let's choose pathfx

107
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,300
from the pathfx menu I'm going to choose

108
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,879
the envelope deformation option which is

109
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,440
right here

110
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
and in the settings menu I want to

111
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,799
disable this setting right here that

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,260
says enable left and right paths we only

113
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,239
want to enable the top and bottom for

114
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,799
what we're doing here so let me deselect

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,659
that and then click on this button right

116
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,480
here that says Top Bend path

117
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,799
and once you do that you'll get this

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,299
little green line at the top of the

119
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,400
object here and if you hover your cursor

120
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,140
over you can click and drag

121
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,480
to bend the text up like that

122
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,860
and then we'll do the same thing here

123
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,379
we'll choose the bottom bent path and

124
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,620
we'll bend that text up like that

125
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,540
and just like that we have arced our

126
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,580
text so let me grab my selection tool

127
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,260
let's move these items up a little bit

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,339
and I'm just going to Center this up one

129
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,540
more time just to make sure everything

130
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
is still aligned

131
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,839
and now I'm going to make this much

132
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,979
bigger because if you're going to print

133
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,000
this on a shirt you're going to want

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
this design to be really big so let me

135
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
make this a lot bigger

136
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,759
again holding the control key while I

137
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,380
scale to ensure that everything remains

138
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,660
proportionate and now I'm going to

139
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,699
resize my document to match this

140
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,020
selection right here so with everything

141
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,419
selected I'm going to press Ctrl shift

142
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,340
and R or if you're using Mac it would be

143
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,380
command shift and R and there we go now

144
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,520
we're finished you could take this

145
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,740
design export it and upload it to a site

146
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,419
like Teespring or spreadshirt or

147
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,880
wherever else and have your shirt

148
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,740
printed so I think that should do it for

149
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,060
today's tutorial that is how you can

150
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,040
Arch text to create a simple athletic

151
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,680
T-shirt design using inkscape if you

152
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
found this lesson useful then consider

153
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
checking out my inkscape master class

154
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,500
it's a collection of over 60 videos

155
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,120
where I go over all of the tools and

156
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,160
features in inkscape and I explain what

157
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
they are and demonstrate how they work

158
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,300
kind of like how I did in this video we

159
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,979
even have a private Community where you

160
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,780
can ask questions and get help from me

161
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,300
anytime you want and best of all there's

162
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,280
no monthly membership fees you just pay

163
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,699
17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

164
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,020
have some information about that down

165
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,699
below if you want to check that out as

166
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,900
