1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,560
inkscape is a large application with

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,520
lots of advanced

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,000
tools and features as a new user you

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,680
have a lot to learn and you're probably

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,200
going to make some mistakes along the

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,840
way

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,519
in this video i'll be going over some of

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
the more common mistakes new users make

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,590
so you can avoid making them yourself

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
this is nick with logosbynick.com and in

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
this video i'll be going over five of

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,279
the most common mistakes users make

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
when they're new to inkscape and if

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,079
you'd like to learn more about how

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,960
inkscape works

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
be sure to check out my inkscape master

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
class it's a collection of over 60

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,800
videos where i go over every tool and

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,920
feature in inkscape

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
and i explain what it is and demonstrate

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
how it works i'll have a link in the

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,559
description of the video if you want to

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,520
check that out

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
that being said let's get started

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
one of the most common mistakes i see

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
new users making is trying to perform

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,920
path operations on objects that aren't

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
paths

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
in short path operations allow you to

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
take multiple objects and turn them into

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,319
new objects

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,840
based on how they interact with each

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
other you can unify them

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
subtract them from each other use the

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
intersecting area to create a new

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,799
object and more however this only works

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,040
on

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
individual objects that are paths so if

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,880
you're trying to unify

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
groups of objects for example it's not

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,080
going to work

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
you'll have to ungroup the objects first

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
same for text objects

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
and rasterized images these objects are

46
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,280
not

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
paths therefore the path operations will

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,799
have no effect on them

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
another mistake you might make if you're

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,079
new to inkscape and don't know any

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,560
better

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,799
is neglecting to respect the power of

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
the edit paths by nodes tool

54
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,200
the nodes tool allows you to transform

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
all of the individual coordinate points

56
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,399
of a vector object

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
but it also has the power to freeze up

58
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
the software

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
and make it crash if you try to select

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
objects with too many nodes

61
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
this is more of a problem with inkscape

62
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,360
than it is with the user so i can't

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
really blame someone for walking into

64
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,520
this problem

65
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
but it is something you need to be aware

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
of regardless when working with the

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,079
nodes tool

68
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,479
always be careful not to select objects

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
that are really complex

70
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
and may have lots of nodes if possible

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
try to break your objects apart into

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
separate objects first

73
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
another mistake you might make as a new

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
user to inkscape is forgetting to

75
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
delegate

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
whether or not you want the strokes on

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
your object to scale

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,560
with the object every vector object has

79
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,599
two properties

80
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
a fill color and a stroke that acts as

81
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
an outline around your object

82
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
and the stroke has its own size

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
independent of the size of the object

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
if you scale down your object you may

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
notice that the thickness of the stroke

86
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
scales down with it if you'd like to

87
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
maintain the thickness of the stroke

88
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
regardless of how you scale your object

89
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,959
though you can find the setting for that

90
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,040
in the tool settings menu for the select

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
tool just look for the icon that says

92
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
when scaling objects scale the stroke

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
width by the same proportion when you

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
hover your cursor over it

95
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
if you'd like your strokes to scale

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
alongside your objects

97
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
leave it enabled if you'd like to

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
maintain a fixed size for your strokes

99
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,000
regardless of scaling

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
simply turn it off

101
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
next up on our list of common mistakes

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
you might make as a new inkscape user is

103
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
forgetting to disable snapping when

104
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
you're working

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
snapping is a really useful feature that

106
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
allows you to draw with precision

107
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
for example let's say you have two boxes

108
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,239
and you want to place them

109
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
flush against each other doing this

110
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
freehands would prove difficult because

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
it would be nearly impossible for you to

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
know

113
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
exactly where the edges are with

114
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,239
snapping enabled though

115
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
your objects will snap directly against

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
each other once they're in close

117
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
proximity

118
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,519
as useful as this may be there will be

119
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
some instances where you're trying to

120
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,319
create something

121
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
but the snaps keep getting in the way

122
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
and drawing your cursor away from where

123
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,560
you actually want it to be

124
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
to disable snapping just click the

125
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
enable snapping icon

126
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
in the top left portion of your screen

127
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,000
or what i like to do is just press

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
shift and 5 on the keyboard as a

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
shortcut

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
the final common mistake new inkscape

131
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
users make has to do with exporting png

132
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,720
images

133
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
exporting allows you to generate usable

134
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
copies of your designs in the dot png

135
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,000
format

136
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
this is useful for exporting your logo

137
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,759
for use on a website

138
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,720
generating app icons graphics for a game

139
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
so on and so forth

140
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
one aspect of the export menu that many

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
users overlook though

142
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
is the export area section this is what

143
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
allows you to dictate

144
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
exactly what gets exported the page

145
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
option will export everything inside of

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
your page border

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
the drawing option will export

148
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
everything inside and outside of your

149
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
page border

150
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,479
the selection option will only export an

151
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
object you have selected

152
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
and the custom option allows you to

153
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,919
manually define coordinate points

154
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
on the x and y axis of your canvas that

155
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,919
you'd like to export

156
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
where a lot of users run into trouble is

157
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
when they think they're exporting one

158
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,759
thing

159
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
but they're really exporting something

160
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
else because the proper export area

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,360
setting hasn't been selected

162
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
this is why it's important to always pay

163
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
close attention to the settings

164
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
in the export menu and that should do it

165
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,479
for today's video

166
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
hopefully these pointers will make your

167
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
learning experience a little easier

168
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
if you have any questions or need

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
clarification on anything i've gone over

170
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,080
in this video

171
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
just leave a comment below and as always

172
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:39,750
thanks for watching
