1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,760
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,879
how you can create these technologically

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,359
styled letters that look like they're

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,439
made of circuits using nothing but

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,440
strokes and shapes in inkscape so I'll

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,840
come over here into a new document and

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,519
I'll get started the first thing I want

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,000
to do is grab the rectangle tool and

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
click and drag on the cvas to draw a

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,279
rectangle I want to hold my control key

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,000
while I do that so we have a perfectly

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,480
symmetrical square like that then I'm

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,199
going to remove the fill color from that

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,119
rectangle by clicking this red X down

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,720
here in the bottom left corner and I

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,000
want to apply a black stroke to this

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,960
object by holding the shift key and

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,920
clicking on the black Swatch down here

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,200
in my color palette and now we have a

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,920
square with a black

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,879
outline so let's come over here to the

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,079
selection tool come up here to the tool

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,800
settings menu uh where this icon that

24
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,520
says when scaling objects scale the

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
stroke width by the same proportion

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
let's turn that off for this tutorial

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,480
and now let's change the size of the

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
stroke here so I'm going to open up the

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,879
fill and stroke menu by going to object

30
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,879
and selecting fill and stroke

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,239
and from this menu I'll come over here

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,840
to the stroke style Tab and I want to

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
make sure the stroke width is five

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
pixels so mine's already set to five

35
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
pixels if yours isn't just manually type

36
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,600
that in and change the units of

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,640
measurement to pixels Here and Now I

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,320
want to make this Square 100 by 100

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
pixels so I'll come up here to the

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
toolbar where we have the width and the

41
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,640
height I'm going to turn on this lock

42
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,079
icon between the two of them to make

43
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,600
sure that we're locking the proportions

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,560
as we scale and I'm going to change this

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,640
to 100 and press enter and now we have a

46
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,159
100 100 by 100 rectangle uh with a five

47
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,000
pixel

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
stroke so what I'm going to do now is

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,079
I'm going to duplicate this I'm going to

50
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,040
right click this and go to duplicate and

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to add 25 pixels to each

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,640
Dimension so this one will be 125 pixels

53
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,439
so I'll write in 125 and press enter and

54
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,759
then I'll do this one more time I'll

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,520
right click this go to duplicate and

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,759
I'll make this one 150 so I'll write in

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,240
1 15 and press enter and there we go and

58
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,560
now I'm going to select all three of

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
these and I just want to Center them up

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
vertically and horizontally so I'll open

61
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,039
up the the alignment menu by going to

62
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,360
object and selecting align

63
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,520
distribute and from this menu I want to

64
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,440
choose last selected from this drop down

65
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
and I'll Center them up vertically and

66
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
horizontally just like that so with all

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
of these objects selected let's go to

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
path and select object to path so that

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
now these are no longer rectangles these

70
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
are pure Vector paths and I'm going to

71
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,440
grab my edit paths by nodes tool and I'm

72
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,400
going to click and drag over these nodes

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
over here on the right hand side to

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
select them let me try that again if

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
you're using Max sometimes it's

76
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,319
difficult to select these nodes there we

77
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,920
go I was able to select those nodes now

78
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm going to come up here to the tool

79
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
settings menu where it says add Corners

80
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,920
live path effect I'm going to enable

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,720
that and when I do that you're going to

82
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
see these round knots that appear next

83
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,879
to the nodes and I'm going to select the

84
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,760
nodes again and I'm going to grab this

85
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,120
white node right here and just bring

86
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,720
this in like that until it snaps I want

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,080
this I want it to snap right in the

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
center there before you do that though

89
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,680
let me back up a little bit turn on your

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,319
snapping menu up here by clicking on

91
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,959
this mag magnet icon in the top right

92
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,720
corner and then do that again so let me

93
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,200
uh let me do that again now that I have

94
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
snapping enabled and I want to snap them

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,599
together just like that you'll see that

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,959
red line up here there in the middle I'm

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,959
going to do the same thing with these

98
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,440
other nodes over here I'm going to snap

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
them together so we have nice rounded

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,879
edges like

101
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
that and once we do that we can finalize

102
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,959
this by going to path and selecting

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
object to path now with all with all of

104
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
these objects still selected I'm going

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
to select over all of these nodes right

106
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,239
here and I want to break all of them up

107
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,480
so I'll come over here to the tool

108
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
settings menu and I'm looking for the

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
option that says break path at selected

110
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,840
nodes and when I click on that it's

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,319
going to break them all up into separate

112
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,239
nodes and now we want to break them up

113
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,239
into separate objects so we'll go to

114
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,400
path and select break apart and click

115
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,040
off of the the graphic let's grab this

116
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,400
selection tool and click off of it to

117
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
deselect everything and you can see we

118
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,680
now have individual pieces of this

119
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,360
entire element here and if I select all

120
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
of these I can come over here to my fill

121
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,159
and stroke menu I could bring down the

122
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
opacity roughly in half and just so you

123
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,599
can see where the start and end point is

124
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,480
of each of these lines they all overlap

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,200
and underlap with each other and the

126
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
point of doing this is that we now have

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
these individual elements that we can

128
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,079
use to construct virtually any letter

129
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,879
that we'd like so let me put that back

130
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
and I'm going to zoom out I'm going to

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,440
take all of these and I'm going to right

132
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,279
click them and go to duplicate and move

133
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,000
the duplicate copy off to the side just

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,639
in case I want another copy to work with

135
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,240
if I want to create other letters and

136
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,639
I'm going to use these objects right

137
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,000
here to to uh create the letter A so let

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,759
me select all of them I'm going to

139
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,639
rotate them around by clicking on the

140
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,039
objects and then I'm going to get those

141
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,120
rotation handles and with the rotation

142
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,320
handles enabled I'm going to hold the

143
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,360
control key and just roll it around

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
until it's flat like that and I'm going

145
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
to create a letter A out of this right

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,880
here I'll come back over here to show

147
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,759
you what I mean this letter a is what

148
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,639
we're going to create so let me come

149
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
back into inkscape let me click off of

150
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,680
it to deselect everything I'm going to

151
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,759
click and drag over these three pieces

152
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,960
right here and I'm just going to bring

153
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,800
them up and I'm going to snap them up

154
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,080
here I want this object to snap to this

155
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,800
part of the uh the starting point of

156
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
that curve right there so I'll snap that

157
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,039
in

158
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,400
there and now I want I want to make

159
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
these lines right here all the same

160
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
height so I want to take these lines and

161
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,320
bring them down so that they're the same

162
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,160
height as these ones with snapping

163
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
enabled we should be able to grab the

164
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
nodes tool and select the node and then

165
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
just hold control and bring it straight

166
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,160
down and it may

167
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,440
snap or we might have to create a guide

168
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
for that so it didn't snap to the bottom

169
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
there what I'm going to do is I'm going

170
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
to create a guide uh you should have a

171
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,360
ruler on your canvas up here if you

172
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,880
don't have a ruler uh as is the case on

173
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,360
my screen you can activate it by

174
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,680
pressing control r on your keyboard or

175
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
if you're using Mac it would be command

176
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,280
R and once we have that ruler we can

177
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,880
click and drag a guide down here and I'm

178
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,840
going to snap that Guide to the bottom

179
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,880
of this path right here and now I could

180
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
take these paths and snap them down to

181
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
the bottom of the guide and I'm holding

182
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,960
control while I do this to lock the line

183
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,479
onto the vertical axis if I'm not

184
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,840
holding control it's going to wobble

185
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,880
around like that holding control will

186
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
enable you to lock it onto that axis so

187
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll come over here and do the same

188
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,759
thing I'm going to snap these lines as

189
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
well and then I'm going to zoom back

190
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,599
out and I'm going to adjust these lines

191
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,120
here so let me select this line in the

192
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
middle and I'm going to take this node

193
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,720
and bring this in right here and I'm

194
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,319
holding control while I do that to lock

195
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,840
it onto the horizontal axis I'm going to

196
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
bring that line right there and I'll do

197
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
the same thing over here on this side

198
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm just going to bring these lines in

199
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,840
like that and then I want to take this

200
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,039
line right here and take this node and

201
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,199
just snap it down here and I'll do the

202
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,479
same thing over here on this side I'll

203
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,199
snap this line onto this node and we end

204
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,479
up with this outcome right here so I'm

205
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,880
going to get rid of the guide now I'm

206
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,280
going to make the guide Invisible by

207
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,000
holding shift and pressing the vert

208
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,039
vertical Bar Key on the keyboard and I'm

209
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,440
going to get rid of the ruler as well

210
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm going to press command r or controlr

211
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
again to get rid of that and what we

212
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,160
have here is we have all of these

213
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,560
individual lines for each segment here

214
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,080
we want it to be one continuous path so

215
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,800
for this segment here this is not a

216
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
continuous path this is broken up into

217
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,000
three pieces to make this a continuous

218
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,479
path I'm going to select all of the

219
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,120
objects by holding shift and clicking on

220
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,759
each of them and then I'll come over

221
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
here to my nodes tool and I want to

222
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,039
select all of these nodes I'm going to

223
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
hold shift while I'm doing that select

224
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,879
all of the nodes and with them all

225
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,800
selected I'm going to come up here to

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
the tool settings menu where it says

227
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,879
join selected nodes and click on that

228
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,840
and you can you should see that those

229
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,879
overlapping segments go away we now have

230
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,599
uh combined the nodes together so let me

231
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,919
grab my selection tool if you notice we

232
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,520
have a little bit of an extra piece that

233
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,160
got left out here this is kind of like a

234
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
I guess you could consider it a

235
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
mathematical error with working with

236
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,919
vectors it's really not supposed to be

237
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,560
there but it happens sometimes let me

238
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,919
put that back if you have this on your

239
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,720
screen you could just select it and then

240
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
press delete on your keyboard to get rid

241
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,680
of it and now we're going to do the same

242
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,199
thing to the rest of these paths we want

243
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,039
this to be one continuous path as well

244
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,400
so I'm going to select each of these

245
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
I'll come over here to my nodes tool

246
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
I'll select each of these these nodes

247
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,639
one by one I want to make sure they're

248
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,159
all selected I'm going to hold shift

249
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,560
while I do that to make sure they're all

250
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,680
selected and I'll unify those together

251
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,039
as well and now I will do the same thing

252
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
to this line that runs in the middle so

253
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm going to hold shift and select each

254
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,360
of these lines and then I'll click and

255
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
drag over each of these nodes while

256
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,680
holding shift to select all of them and

257
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,759
once I do that I'll merge them together

258
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,039
as well now that's one continuous path

259
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
and then finally I'll do that for this

260
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,000
path as well so I'm going to select each

261
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,319
of these hold shift and click and drag

262
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,760
over each and then combine them

263
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,399
together and there we go now we have

264
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,799
continuous paths for each segment of

265
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,919
this letter so at this point in the

266
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
tutorial we're going to start

267
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
subtracting areas of these lines and

268
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,320
adding the circles to the ends of them

269
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,160
to really complete this look here so let

270
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,320
me come back into here and we'll get

271
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
started on this uh I think at this point

272
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
we can bring the opacity of these

273
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
objects back up let me select all of

274
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
them and bring the opacity back up to

275
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
100% And I'm going to start off with

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
this segment in the center here I'm

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,640
going to select that and grabb my nodes

278
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,480
tool and I want to add a couple of nodes

279
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
in an area where I'd like to subtract

280
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,720
part of the line so I'm going to double

281
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,600
click right here to add a new node and

282
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
let's say I want to subtract the area or

283
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
remove the line segment between these

284
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,000
two nodes right here I could select both

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,959
of those nodes and I can come up here to

286
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
the tool settings menu and select this

287
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
option that says delete select delete

288
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,519
segment between two non- endpoint nodes

289
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
and click on that and that line has been

290
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,519
eliminated so I'm going to eliminate

291
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,839
another part of this line down here I'm

292
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,560
going to double click to add a new node

293
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
right here and then double click to add

294
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
a node right here and then I'll select

295
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,600
both of those and I'll sub I'll uh

296
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,360
subtract that segment as well and now

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,640
what we can do is we can put the circles

298
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,720
at the tips of those lines by coming

299
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,360
over here to the stroke style Tab and if

300
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,839
you notice we have these three drop

301
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,760
downs for markers I'm going to choose

302
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,279
this drop down over here in the left

303
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,839
first I'm going to choose I'm going to

304
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,160
click on that I'm going to choose this

305
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,360
rounded marker right here and I want to

306
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
make the size of that 04 so by default

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,440
it's 1.0 I'm going to remove that and

308
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,320
type in4 and press enter and I'm going

309
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,279
to close out of that and I want to apply

310
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,480
the same type of marker to the end point

311
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,320
so I'm going to click on this drop down

312
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,079
and instead of choosing Circle again and

313
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,720
manually typing in that size we could

314
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
just use the most recently applied

315
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,120
marker so I'm going to choose this one

316
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,800
right up here in the top of this list

317
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
and now we have it applied there as well

318
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,839
so the problem at this point is that we

319
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,720
have the circles at the start point and

320
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,279
the end point but we don't have them on

321
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
these middle points here so to fix that

322
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm just going to break this apart I'll

323
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
come up here and go to path and I'll

324
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
select break apart and now these are

325
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
separate segments that have the circles

326
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,399
at the start point and the end point of

327
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,240
each

328
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,720
line so now let's do the same thing down

329
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,560
here with this other segment this time

330
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm going to put the line braks on the

331
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,720
opposite side so instead of putting the

332
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
line break right here where it looks

333
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,760
kind of symmetrical I'm going to make it

334
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,480
look a little little more Whimsical than

335
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,959
that so I'll put it over here I'm going

336
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,839
to grab my nodes tool I'll double click

337
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,760
to add a point right here and then I'll

338
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
add another point right here and then

339
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm going to select those and delete the

340
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,200
segment between between them and then

341
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,519
I'll put another one down here I'll

342
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,760
double click this one and then put

343
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,639
another one right there and I'll delete

344
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,839
that segment out of there and now we can

345
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,480
just go to our markers drop down and

346
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,959
choose our previously used marker for

347
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,360
each the uh for both the start and the

348
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,639
end point and now we can break this

349
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,040
apart by going to path and

350
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
selecting break

351
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,240
apart and there we go that segment is

352
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,959
done now when I'm creating these letters

353
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
what I like to do is I like to leave the

354
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,320
center line in place I don't like to

355
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,040
break them apart and add those nodes on

356
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
there because then it starts to look

357
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,160
less like a letter I've noticed that

358
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,000
leaving that line like it is helps

359
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
preserve its appearance as a letter

360
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,639
especially if you zoom out more so let

361
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,959
me Zoom back in and finally I'll do this

362
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
outer line here so for this outer line

363
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm going to put the line brakes at

364
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
opposite sides of this one here in the

365
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
center so instead of putting the line

366
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
brake right here I'll put it over here

367
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,320
so let me go back to my nodes tool I'll

368
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,760
click double click to add a node where I

369
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
want the line brakes to be select both

370
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,880
of them

371
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,120
delete the segment and then I'll come

372
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,399
down here and do the same thing I'll

373
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,160
maybe choose this part right here and

374
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
then I'll just delete the segment

375
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,600
between these two nodes let me try that

376
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,279
again and then I'll delete that out of

377
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,639
there and again once again we could just

378
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,360
choose the same markers for the start

379
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
and end

380
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,560
point and then break it apart by going

381
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,320
to path and selecting break

382
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,839
apart and what I like to do is for this

383
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
Center Line here I'm just going to grab

384
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,199
my nodes tool and I'm going to select

385
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,839
these two nodes and I'm just going to

386
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,639
drag this down a little bit personally I

387
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,040
think this just looks a little better

388
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
when this Center Line descends down a

389
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,519
little further than those other two

390
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,320
lines right there and as you can see

391
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,959
we're finished with the letter now if

392
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
you want to change the color and style

393
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,959
of your letter you could just select

394
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,440
over all of it and change the stroke

395
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,560
color so I'll come over here to the

396
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,399
stroke paint Tab and I'll choose a new

397
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,720
color for my stroke that I've created

398
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
and there we go now we have a blue sort

399
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,240
of line like that now one thing to keep

400
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,600
in mind is because we have this setting

401
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,839
disabled if you go to scale this object

402
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,560
up like that the lines are going to

403
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,440
appear thinner and the same thing if you

404
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
scale it down if you scale it down the

405
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,480
lines are going to appear thicker like

406
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
that if you want to preserve the object

407
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
so that it scales the line the line

408
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,199
weight stays the same regardless of how

409
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,760
much you scale it just enable this

410
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,040
setting again and now you'll be able to

411
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,120
scale your object however you'd like

412
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,279
without losing any of those proportions

413
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,839
and now you can repeat that process

414
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,399
using these objects over here you could

415
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,560
take these lines and use them to create

416
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,360
every other letter of the alphabet and

417
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,839
I'll put a quick little graphic up on

418
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,360
the screen here just to show you how I

419
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
went about creating all of the

420
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
individual letters of the alphabet if

421
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
you want to use that for

422
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
inspiration and that should do it for

423
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,519

60 videos where I go over all of the

428
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
tools and features in inkscape and I

429
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,279
explain what they are and demonstrate

430
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,120
how they work kind of like how I did in

431
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
this video we even have a private

432
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,800
