1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
in previous tutorials i've demonstrated

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,080
how to create simple line style drawings

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
from photos by using some of the tool

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,320
settings in the pen tool but inkscape

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
has come a very long way since then and

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,599
there's now a better way to do this

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
using the power stroke path effect in

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
this lesson i'll be showing you how

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,719
[Music]

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
so let's go over how you can use this

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,880
handy feature in inkscape we're going to

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
start off by drawing a single line using

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
the bezier pen which is located over

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,719
here in your toolbar or you could access

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,079
it by pressing the letter b on your

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,200
keyboard

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,879
i'm going to click on the canvas once to

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,480
create a point and then i'm going to

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
hold ctrl on the keyboard and move the

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
line straight across my screen like that

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,920
and then click again to create another

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
point and then i can let go of control

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
and then i'm going to close the path by

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
pressing enter on the keyboard and now

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
we have a single line here as you can

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,879
see

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,079
now what i'm going to do is grab the

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,520
edit paths by nodes tool which is

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,359
located over here and i'm going to click

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,960
and drag on this line like this just to

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,239
give it a little bit of a curve and then

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
i'm going to click on these nodes over

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
here

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,159
and i'm going to get access to these

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,840
handles and use these handles to make

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
this

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
line dip down over here and then rise up

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
over here so we have a fluid curved line

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
like that now i'm creating this because

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
this is a good

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,000
uh way to depict what this path effect

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,960
does

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,479
so once we've done that let's grab the

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,479
selection tool we now have our line

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,320
selected i'm going to open up the path

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,479
effects menu by going to path and

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,960
selecting path effects

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
and with this line selected i want to

49
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,079
click this little plus icon down here in

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,759
the bottom right corner to add a new

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,880
path effect

52
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,240
and the path effect that we're going to

53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
be adding from this list is called power

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
stroke now instead of trying to navigate

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,159
through this list and find it you can

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,840
just use the search bar up here and type

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
in power

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,399
and it should come up right over there

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
as you can see power stroke click on

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
that

61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
and now we have a power stroke applied

62
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
what we want to do to edit this power

63
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,399
stroke is come back over here to the

64
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,399
edit paths by nodes tool

65
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,000
and you'll notice on your path you

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
should see three pink nodes let me zoom

67
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
in a little bit i'm going to hold ctrl

68
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,200
and roll up the mouse wheel so you can

69
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,320
see it better

70
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,318
there's one pink node right here in the

71
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
center point of the path

72
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
and then over here there's another pink

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,760
point on the

74
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
on the left hand side of the path or

75
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
otherwise known as the start point of

76
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,400
the path where you originally drew the

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
path first and then over here towards

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
the end point there's another pink path

79
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
now all all of these handles allow you

80
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,840
to change the width of your stroke

81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
so if i click and drag on this pink path

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
right here you can see the stroke is

83
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
becoming wider as i move it like this

84
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
and if i use this handle down here i can

85
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
make this end of the line wider as well

86
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
i could even move this the opposite way

87
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
and get like a little bit of a crossover

88
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
effect there but i'm going to use this

89
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,599
to make this about that size and then

90
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,640
i'll do the same thing over here i'll

91
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
make this about that size and another

92
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,640
thing that you can do is you can move

93
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,360
the location of these handles

94
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
so that you can change the width of any

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,879
particular spot of your line as you see

96
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
me doing here i could give this a line a

97
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
bulge over here so that this kind of

98
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
looks like a leaf or a paintbrush maybe

99
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
or i could bring this down here so that

100
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
we end up with a

101
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,159
maybe it looks more like a follicle of

102
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
hair or something like that okay so let

103
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
me put this back over here let me show

104
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
you what some of these tool settings are

105
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,959
over here

106
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,239
in the bottom right hand corner of the

107
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
screen now if you notice there's a start

108
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,879
cap and then there's an end cap the

109
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
start cap is the beginning of the path

110
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
that you originally drew and the end cap

111
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
is the end of the path that was

112
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
most recently finished

113
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
now if i change this by default it's set

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
to zero width if i want to change the

115
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,519
start cap to rounded

116
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,080
or to let's say for example but

117
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
it ends up with the flat

118
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,599
edge like that so you could take this

119
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,959
handle and bring this over here like

120
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
this and pull this all the way out so

121
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,959
you get this sort of effect right here

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,280
where it kind of looks like a wispy hair

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
okay so let me undo that and then

124
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
there's other settings in here you could

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
try as well you can make this peak

126
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,159
which ends up with something like this

127
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
right here

128
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
or you can make this round so that you

129
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
have a rounded path like that

130
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,519
you can make this square so you have a

131
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
squared path and then zero width takes

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
you back to the starting point with the

133
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
fine tip like that

134
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
so let's put this tool into context and

135
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
use it to create a simple abstract

136
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,199
mountain range logo i'm going to grab

137
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
the bezier pen

138
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
and i'm going to create some points on

139
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
my canvas in the shape of a mountain top

140
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
with a couple of peaks

141
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
as you can see here like this

142
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
and i'll press enter

143
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
and now i'm going to add the power

144
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
stroke path effect as we did previously

145
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
grab the edit pads by nodes tool i'm

146
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,880
going to use my pink handles over here

147
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
to make this a little wider i'm going to

148
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
use this handle over here and put this

149
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
towards the top of the base of the leg

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
so that it looks a little more

151
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,160
consistent

152
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
there we go and i want this side to be a

153
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,040
little thicker than the rest of it so

154
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
i'll make that a little bigger like that

155
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
now if you notice here the corners of

156
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
this mountain range are rounded

157
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
the reason why that happens is because

158
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
the default setting over here in the

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,639
tool settings where it says join

160
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
is rounded by default if you want

161
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
corners there what i would recommend

162
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
doing is selecting miter and as you can

163
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
see now we get sharp corners like that

164
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
or if you're working with curved paths

165
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
sometimes you'll want to use

166
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
extrapolated arc as well if the corners

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
don't show up using miter

168
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
for this demonstration we'll be sticking

169
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,759
with miter

170
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
okay so now that that's done i'm going

171
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
to create another line i'm going to come

172
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,320
over here

173
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
i'm going to draw a line over here

174
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
start a point right there

175
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
start another point right there

176
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
and press enter on the keyboard and i'm

177
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
going to grab the edit pads by nodes

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
tool i'm just going to click and drag

179
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
this down like that

180
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
and i'll take this and i'll maybe bring

181
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
this line up like that

182
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
maybe bring this one down a little more

183
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,400
we want a nice fluid curve here

184
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
and i'm going to update my mountain

185
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
range

186
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
to to accommodate this swoosh a little

187
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
bit i'm going to take this side right

188
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
here move that up a little bit

189
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
that's a little better

190
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
and now i'm going to apply a power

191
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
stroke to this line right here

192
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
use my nodes right here to make this

193
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
wider

194
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
make this a little wider

195
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,039
and then make this a little wider

196
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
and maybe even make this a little wider

197
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
okay that's looking a lot better

198
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,840
and i'm just going to adjust this a

199
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
little bit make sure this is looking

200
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
the way i'd like it to look

201
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,039
and there we go i'd say that's good

202
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,080
enough so what i'm going to do now is

203
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
grab the selection tool as you can see

204
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
now as you can see here we have created

205
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,560
a very simple abstract mountain logo now

206
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
at any point you can go back and edit

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
the nodes of these tools you can go back

208
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
and edit the width of these lines over

209
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
here like that of the power stroke

210
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
and if at any point you want to finalize

211
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
this so that it becomes an editable path

212
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
all you have to do is select everything

213
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,199
and go to path

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
object to path and if you go back to

215
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
your nodes tool now you can see that

216
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
this is an individual path that was

217
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
created using that power stroke function

218
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,039
so i think that should do it for today's

219
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,800
tutorial that is how you can use the

220
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
power stroke path effect in inkscape

221
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,720
before i end this video if you found

222
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
this lesson useful then consider

223
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,880
checking out my inkscape master class

224
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
it's a collection of over 60 videos

225
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
where i go over all of the tools and

226
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
features in inkscape and i explain what

227
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
they are and demonstrate how they work

228
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
kind of like how i did in this video we

229
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,840
even have a private community where you

230
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
can ask questions and get help from me

231
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
anytime you want and best of all there's

232
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
no monthly membership fees you just pay

233
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
17 one time and you're in for life i'll

234
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
have some information about that in the

235
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
description of the video if you want to

236
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
check that out as always thanks for

237
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,240
watching

238
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,840
you
