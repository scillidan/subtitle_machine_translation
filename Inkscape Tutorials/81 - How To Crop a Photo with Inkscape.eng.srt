00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:10,440
this is Nick of logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,519
in today's tutorial I'll be

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,110
demonstrating how you can crop a photo

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,690
using Inkscape and if you'd like to

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,220
learn more about how Inkscape works be

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,900
sure to check out the Inkscape master

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,300
class which is a collection of over 50

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,250
videos where I go over every single tool

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,960
and feature in Inkscape and I explain

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,310
what it is and demonstrate how it works

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,109
I'll put a link in the description of

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,310
the video if you want to check that out

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,410
so to get started here I'm going to open

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,940
up Inkscape the first thing we want to

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,410
do is just make sure that we set up our

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,760
documents that we're all working with

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,500
this similar setup I'm gonna come up

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,149
here to where it says view we're gonna

20
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,160
want custom selected and then I'm going

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,559
to go to zoom going to zoom in at 1 to 1

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,270
and then I want to open up the the edit

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,190
objects colors gradients and Stroke menu

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,780
with this button up here or you could

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
just press control shift F as a keyboard

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,180
shortcut and what I want to do now is

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,370
import my photo into Inkscape you can do

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,230
that by going to file import and

29
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,120
navigating to the file on your hard

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,949
drive where the photo is located what I

31
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,479
like to do is I like to just grab a

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,100
folder like this and just click and drag

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,189
it into Inkscape like that and I'm just

34
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,720
gonna choose M bed if it asks you if you

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,310
want to embed it or link it I just like

36
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,439
to go with embed and there we go there's

37
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,759
the photo I'm gonna be cropping let me

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,840
zoom out a little bit I'm gonna hold

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,909
ctrl and roll down the mouse wheel to

40
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,530
zoom out a little bit what I'm gonna be

41
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,689
doing here is removing the subject from

42
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,479
the background here now before we get

43
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,890
started I just have to mention that this

44
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,240
is the sort of thing that would be

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
better suited for an application like

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,439
 inkscape isn't really designed for

47
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,909
working with photos like this it's more

48
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,520
for vector design but if you don't feel

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,229
like downloading if you're not a

50
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,369
user and you don't feel like downloading

51
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,049
and installing and learning how to

52
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,939
use a new piece of software this can

53
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,710
absolutely be done with Inkscape in fact

54
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,530
i do this with Inkscape all the time so

55
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,369
just wanted to throw that out there

56
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,869
before we get started so let me get

57
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,070
started here I'm gonna zoom in a little

58
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,750
bit to zoom in and out again who's

59
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,250
holding ctrl and rolling up and down the

60
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,840
mouse wheel we'll be doing that a lot

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,579
throughout this tutorial we'll also be

62
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,290
moving the page around like this to do

63
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,729
this I'm pressing down the mouse wheel

64
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,560
and moving the mouse just basic

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,820
navigation tools you're gonna have to

66
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,979
keep in mind while working on this I'm

67
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,449
gonna start over here about the lower

68
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,819
right edge of the subject I'm going to

69
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,560
grab the bezel

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,090
which is over here or you could present

71
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,790
beyond the keyboard and I'm going to

72
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,290
click to create a point outside of the

73
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,480
photo here and I'm going to start

74
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,420
creating points going around the edge of

75
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,510
the subject here just like this and if

76
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,459
you notice these lines aren't exactly

77
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,110
smooth they're not following the

78
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,360
contours of the subjects outline here

79
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,069
but that's okay we're gonna go back and

80
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,390
fix that later so don't worry about that

81
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,250
right now just go ahead and click to

82
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,620
create these points going around the

83
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,450
subject and this is a pretty big photo

84
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,830
with a lot of points to create so what

85
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,030
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do this and

86
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm gonna fast forward and I'll catch up

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,459
with you what I'm done

88
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,950
okay so as you can see here I went

89
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,690
around the outside of the subject here

90
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,430
and I've traced an outline coming out to

91
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,200
the other end of the photo what I'm

92
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,970
gonna do is I'm just gonna bring this

93
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,220
line around outside the photo over here

94
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,540
and connect it back to the starting

95
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,220
point by clicking on that and it's gonna

96
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,630
create a shape there like that if you

97
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,280
notice now we have a shape going around

98
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,140
the outline of the subject let me go

99
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,790
ahead and undo that what we want to do

100
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,020
now is we want to account for these

101
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,030
negative space areas within this within

102
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,010
the subject here assuming your photo

103
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,959
does have these negative space areas if

104
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,100
it doesn't don't worry about it but

105
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,510
we're gonna have to eliminate these

106
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,640
areas like between the hand and the

107
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,100
shoulder over here and the same over

108
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,390
here on this side so I'm gonna do is I'm

109
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,180
gonna create more shapes inside of here

110
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,720
doing the same thing just creating

111
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,890
following along the contours of the

112
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,440
subject with the Bezier pen by creating

113
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,959
points like that I'll put one right

114
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,170
there another one here for the hair

115
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,160
okay so once you're done accounting for

116
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,260
all of the areas of negative space what

117
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,460
we want to do is combine them all

118
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,900
together by grabbing the select tool

119
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,420
over here I'm gonna grab this area right

120
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,070
here I'm gonna hold shift and click on

121
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,480
the other one so that we can select

122
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,790
multiples at a time I'm gonna hold shift

123
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,590
click on that one and then hold shift

124
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,910
and click on that one and you should

125
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,320
have all of them selected if you

126
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,149
shift-click them and what I want to do

127
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,480
is unify them together by going to path

128
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,030
Union and now what I want to do is take

129
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,160
that group of unified objects and

130
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,770
subtract them from the main outline that

131
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,180
we created in the background over there

132
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,460
so with this group of objects selected

133
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,080
I'm going to hold shift and I'm going to

134
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,940
click on the original outline and I'm

135
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,330
gonna go to path difference and nothing

136
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,560
is going to change visually on the

137
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,570
screen but if you change the color of

138
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,060
the object here you'll see it now fits

139
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,120
the shape of the subject here if you see

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,500
I missed that one so let me just

141
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,640
subtract that as well

142
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,900
path difference there we go okay so what

143
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,460
I want to do now is I want to go back to

144
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,930
where what I was talking about earlier

145
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,460
with those rough lines I want to make

146
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,960
them smooth so let me turn off the fill

147
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,120
color of this and let me zoom in on this

148
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,000
area over here where we started out let

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,620
me go to the edit pads by nodes tool

150
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,660
over here or a good pressed end on the

151
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,330
keyboard let me just fix that one it's

152
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,920
not quite right there we go what I'm

153
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,000
gonna do is I'm gonna click and drag

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
over this node right here and I'm gonna

155
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,240
click on this button that says make

156
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,060
selected nodes Auto smooth and it's

157
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,740
gonna make that node smooth so that it's

158
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,290
no longer like a rough like a like a

159
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,510
polygonal sort of corner it's gonna make

160
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,680
it smooth I'll do the same thing with

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,990
this node over here make that smooth and

162
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,860
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

163
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,000
through and do this with all of these

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,860
nodes but we're not gonna do this node

165
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,210
by node because that would take forever

166
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,770
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select

167
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,690
these multiples at a time by holding

168
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,360
shift and clicking on them you can't

169
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,220
select multiples at a time as I'm doing

170
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,600
here just hold your shift and click and

171
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,640
drag over them and make sure not to

172
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,230
select any corner so let me show you

173
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
what I mean I'm gonna come over here I'm

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,620
not gonna select that node because it's

175
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,669
a corner I don't want to make that

176
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,560
smooth so with these selected let me

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,900
make those Auto smooth and if you notice

178
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,460
it's now smooth it now follows the

179
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,140
contours of the subject they're a little

180
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,180
more closely if you take a corner node

181
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,070
and you make that smooth you're gonna

182
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,660
end up with that we don't want to end up

183
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,890
with that right there so let me undo

184
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,510
that by hitting ctrl Z

185
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,550
and I'm gonna go through and select more

186
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,100
of these nodes making sure to avoid the

187
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,060
corners like I previously mentioned let

188
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,810
me see let me see how this looks okay

189
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,230
good

190
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,610
let me go through here and do this as

191
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,560
well I'm gonna go through the entire

192
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
image and do this with all of these

193
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,500
nodes and then once again I'll I'll

194
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,580
catch up if you when I'm done

195
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,120
okay so I finished going through and

196
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,190
smoothing out all of the nodes of the

197
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,650
the outline here now we're ready to crop

198
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,880
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab

199
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,980
the select tool I want to take this

200
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,330
object right here I just want to give

201
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,680
this a different color look I'm gonna

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,270
make this green for example just so we

203
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,430
can see what exactly will be cropping

204
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,440
right here now what I want to do is get

205
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,730
rid of that outline so I'm gonna hold

206
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,410
shift I'm gonna click on this little red

207
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,900
X down here in the bottom left corner

208
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,070
and let me just bring the opacity of

209
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,540
this down a little bit just so I can see

210
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,010
I just want to double check and make

211
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,450
sure that everything that I'm cropping

212
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,040

213
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,080

214
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,639
here looks like it's gonna be a clean

215
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,810

231
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,550
the original photo of how it was

232
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,750
otherwise you can just leave it right

233
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,610
there as it is and that is how you can

234
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,010
