[Music]

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,940
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,139
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,809
how you can create this eSports logo

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,050
using Inkscape version 1.0 and it's

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,840
important that you use version 1.0 for

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,610
this tutorial because we will be using

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,310
the new offset live path effect quite a

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,050
bit in this lesson and it's also

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,000
important that you download and install

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,730
a particular font known as Falcons I

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,230
will have that linked in the description

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,780
of the video it is a free font so go

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,820
ahead and download and install that font

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,100
before you launch Inkscape and you'll be

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,350
good to go and before we get started if

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,399
you would like to learn more about

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,050
Inkscape be sure to check out my

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,030
Inkscape masterclass it's a collection

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,790
of over 60 videos where I go over every

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,710
single tool and feature in Inkscape and

22
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,540
I explain what it is and demonstrate how

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,040
it works I'll put a link in the

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,329
description of the video if you want to

25
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,030
check that out so we'll get started here

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,160
in Inkscape the first thing we want to

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,590
do is setup our documents that we're all

28
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,509
working with this similar layout the

29
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,890
first thing I want to do is come up here

30
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,000
and click this button to disable

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,159
snapping I want this all disabled for

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,690
the time being we'll be enabling it

33
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,890
throughout the tutorial but for now we

34
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,570
want that turned off we're gonna come up

35
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,330
here to where it says view view we're

36
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,490
gonna want custom selected and I'm going

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,650
to go to zoom I'm going to zoom in at 1

38
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,439
to 1 and for now we're gonna want the

39
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,530
alignment distribute menu opened we're

40
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,090
gonna want last selected chosen from

41
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,250
that drop-down then we want the fill and

42
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,869
Stroke menu open which is this button

43
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:34,250
over here or you could press control

44
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,060
shift + F and let me just expand that so

45
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,650
that I have both of these open at the

46
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,659
same time I just want to change the way

47
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,159
that those menus are Doc's there we go

48
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,500
and we're gonna use the path effects

49
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,060
menu too but I'll get to that a little

50
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,009
later so what we want to do now is

51
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,540
basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

52
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,040
break this up into three different parts

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,659
and I'll have them time stamped down

54
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,549
below because this is this is somewhat

55
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,780
of an elaborate design so it's gonna

56
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,670
take us a while to create this and the

57
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,500
first part will create the text the

58
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,090
second part will create the emblem and

59
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,189
then in the third part will create the

60
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,540
controller so let's start off with the

61
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,880
text I'm gonna grab the text tool and

62
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,408
I'm gonna click on the canvas here and

63
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,510
I'm gonna use all caps for this tutorial

64
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,549
I'm going to use the word eSports for

65
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:17,990
example grab the grab the text tool

66
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm going to change that grab the text

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,770
editor up here I'm gonna change this to

68
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,780
Falcons there we go that's the font

69
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,900
we're looking for let me grab the Select

70
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,760
tool and hold ctrl and shift to scale

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,830
this up what we want to do now is

72
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,450
manually adjust the spacing between

73
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,130
these letters and I also want to change

74
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,230
the way that these letters interact with

75
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,400
each other let me show you what I mean

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,900
here on the thumbnail if you see here

77
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,090
between these letters you'll see I have

78
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,790
the letters kind of look like they fit

79
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,710
next to each other like puzzle pieces I

80
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,060
want to make it so that each letter is

81
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,120
slicing off the top right edge of the

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
letter that comes before it so to do

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,160
that let me get this off the screen to

84
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,810
do that I'm going to convert the text of

85
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,990
paths path object to path and then I'll

86
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,880
ungroup the letters like that and let me

87
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,620
just bring the opacity of that down so I

88
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,960
can see through them a little bit and

89
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,540
I'm gonna zoom in to zoom in I'm holding

90
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,910
ctrl and rolling up the mouse wheel to

91
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,110
move the page around I'm just pressing

92
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,340
down the mouse wheel and moving the

93
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,790
mouse I'm gonna click this letter

94
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,110
hold ctrl click and drag it to the right

95
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,450
like that so that it's not quite

96
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,940
touching the s but pretty close hold

97
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,130
shift click the other letter bring these

98
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,720
two over here like that do the same

99
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,520
thing and that's going to come through

100
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,230
here and do the same thing with the rest

101
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,090
of this world with the rest of this word

102
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,010
holding shift while we click on each

103
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,660
letter so it drags the whole word over

104
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,160
there this isn't necessarily a step that

105
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,900
you have to do but I just think the

106
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,660
design will look a lot better if you go

107
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,980
ahead and make these letters look like

108
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,720
they fit together so what I'm gonna do

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,820
now is I'm gonna duplicate this letter S

110
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,040
right here by pressing ctrl D I'm gonna

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,230
make that red and then I'll hold shift

112
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,170
and click on the letter E and go to path

113
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,120
difference and if you notice now if you

114
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,980
move this apart it looks like those two

115
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,570
letters fit with each other so let me

116
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,100
put that back I'm gonna come through

117
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,240
here and do the same thing with the rest

118
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,850
of these letters duplicate that hold

119
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,890
shift click the letter go to path

120
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,839
difference take the letter O ctrl D hold

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,250
shift click the P

122
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,940
path difference and I'm sure you get the

123
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,070
idea by now so so let me go through and

124
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,550
do this with the rest of the word here

125
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,990
difference I'm actually gonna use the

126
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,490
keyboard shortcut for this last one

127
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,720
because I haven't memorized I actually

128
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,490
never used these menus up here I always

129
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,140
use the keyboard shortcut which for this

130
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,980
one is ctrl shift and - okay so let me

131
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,780
take the letter S and hold ctrl and move

132
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,720
that to the right a little bit hold

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,850
shift click the T move that to the right

134
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,620
a little bit while holding ctrl so that

135
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,910
we're locking it onto the horizontal

136
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,070
axis same thing over here with the R

137
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,930
we're basically we just spacing these

138
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,020
letters out apart like that looking good

139
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,760
do the same thing over here now let me

140
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,990
zoom back out to see how we're looking

141
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,120
over here okay that's looking pretty

142
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
good right there so what I'm gonna do is

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm gonna unify all those letters

144
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,010
together by selecting them all and going

145
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,860
to path Union and now what I want to do

146
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,520
is I want to a plot I want to apply a

147
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,380
perspective like you see here so let me

148
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,100
go to path path effects and you're gonna

149
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,260
get this path effects editor up here I'm

150
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,510
gonna click the add path effect button

151
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,540
and I'm going to look for perspective

152
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,290
there it is perspective envelope and I

153
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,850
want to check this box that says mere

154
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,700
movements in vertical and then grab the

155
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,560
edit pads by nodes tool and what we're

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,930
looking for here we're looking for the

157
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,460
nodes in the corner but they look

158
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,080
different they look similar to the other

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
nodes but the look the node that we're

160
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,040
looking for is white these ones are gray

161
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,750
so they look similar so it's easy to

162
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,950
miss them make sure you're grabbing the

163
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,840
white node like that I'm just going to

164
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,980
take that and pull that out if you want

165
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,690
you could hold ctrl to lock it onto the

166
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,910
axis pull that out a little bit like

167
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,919
that just to give it a little bit of a

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,470
perspective and now we can finalize that

169
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,790
by going to path object to path now what

170
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give this a

171
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,030
bit of a 3d effect as you can see here

172
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,890
if you notice is a bit of a like a 3d

173
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,150
effect like it's coming out at you like

174
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,450
that

175
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,310
we're gonna use the extrude feature for

176
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,550
that so let me grab this select tool let

177
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,440
me just adjust that a little bit make

178
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,210
that a little higher that looks pretty

179
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,520
good I want to right click this text and

180
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,100
go to duplicate I want to make this red

181
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,770
and I want to hold ctrl and move this up

182
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,300
above it a little bit I'm gonna hold

183
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,960
ctrl scale this up a little bit maybe

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,789
about that much it doesn't have to be

185
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,070
exactly the the amount that I'm scaling

186
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,240
it you can just eyeball it like

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
doing here and then I want to select

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,139
both of these actually let me move this

189
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,449
up a little bit let me select both of

190
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,210
these and go to extensions generate from

191
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,229
path and I'm gonna look for extrude and

192
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,880
right here I want to choose polygons and

193
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,210
then click apply and it's gonna create

194
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,280
this 3d block right here so let me get

195
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,770
rid of this let me take this new shape

196
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,039
that I created let me ungroup that the

197
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,099
only unified altogether by going to path

198
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,750
Union and I want to get rid of those

199
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,729
empty negative spaces in there so I'll

200
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:18,740
go to path break apart and then path

201
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,569
Union let me get rid of the stroke or

202
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,099
the outline I'm gonna hold shift and

203
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,500
click on this X up here and let me come

204
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,319
over here to the fill tab under the HSL

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,490
tab I'm just gonna make sure that a

206
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,900
column is brought all the way up and

207
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,520
then I'll bring the opacity down

208
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,800
partially like that and now I can take

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,750
this red text up here our original text

210
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,069
make sure it's raised to the top I'm

211
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,509
gonna click this button raise selection

212
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,000
to the top select both of these and

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,130
Center them up and they come down here

214
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,780
to the alignment menu Center them up on

215
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,719
the vertical axis and then align the top

216
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,820
edges like that so that we end up with

217
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,219
that right there now we could take this

218
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,139
and we can just press delete to get rid

219
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,449
of that we don't need that right now so

220
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,560
now what I want to do is I want to take

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,389
this red text this original text layer

222
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,229
and I want to make this white and then I

223
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,820
want to take the black text beneath it

224
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,460
and I want to apply an offset to it so

225
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,599
I'm gonna come back up here to the path

226
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,300
effects menu click the plus button to

227
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,949
add a path effect and on this time I'm

228
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,979
looking for offset and I would recommend

229
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,330
getting familiar getting comfortable

230
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,800
with this path effect because we'll be

231
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,940
using this a lot throughout this

232
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,490
tutorial where it says offset I'm gonna

233
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,319
click the plus button to increase the

234
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,900
offset and if you notice it's growing a

235
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,449
border around the text right there by

236
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,010
default it should have lighter if not

237
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,149
just go ahead and select that

238
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,089
there we go that's looking pretty good

239
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,950
now let me finalize that by going to

240
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,310
path object to path and now what I want

241
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,839
to do is I want to create another copy

242
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,399
of this text here let me show you where

243
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,170
I'm where I'm going with this notice

244
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,790
this little reflective effect going

245
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,140
through the text there that's what I'm

246
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,270
gonna create next so let me take this

247
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,110
white text let me duplicate that by

248
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,300
Crescent control-d and I'll just make

249
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,010
this red so I can differentiate it up

250
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,230
against the white and I'm going to apply

251
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,540
an offset to this as well so click on

252
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,610
the offset path effect and where it says

253
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,260
offset I'm just going to press - this

254
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,529
time I'm going to click that down maybe

255
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,660
not that much right about there is what

256
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,410
we're going for

257
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,540
again we'll finalize that by going to

258
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,980
path object to path and now I'm going to

259
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,990
grab the rectangle tool I want to slice

260
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,459
this in half here so I'm gonna use the

261
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,950
rectangle tool as a reference point put

262
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,529
that through there like that let me just

263
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,880
make this green so I can see a little

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,240
better okay that looks pretty good let

265
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,450
me go to the Select tool and let me

266
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,399
adjust that just a little more hold

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,350
shift click on the rip on the red text

268
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,940
that we have the green box and the red

269
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,820
text selected and go to path

270
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,560
intersection so what I'm going to do now

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
is I'm going to color this in so let me

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,480
select all of this and bring the opacity

273
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,839
all the way up to 100% and I'm going to

274
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,240
use the colors depicted here in the

275
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,980
thumbnail or something very close anyway

276
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm probably not going to get the exact

277
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,579
shades but I'll take the other black

278
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,050
background here and I'm going to make

279
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,350
this a very dark shade of purple like

280
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,750
that then I'll take the white text in

281
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,250
here I'll make that a light shade of

282
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,100
purple maybe something with a little

283
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,480
more vibrance that looks good maybe

284
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,190
adjust that a little bit and then I want

285
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,070
to make this an even lighter shade of

286
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,110
purple so let me make this something

287
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,820
like that down here I actually know this

288
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,890
has to be a medium shade of purple my

289
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,029
bad okay so we'll do that okay now we're

290
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,589
going to apply to a gradient to this so

291
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:42,850
where it says up here in the fill and

292
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,949
stroke menu we're looking for a linear

293
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,220
gradient click on that grab the gradient

294
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,620
tool which is right here I just like to

295
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,230
press G on the keyboard and then take

296
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,760
the darker stop and put this towards the

297
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,050
top and then take the lighter one and

298
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,699
put this towards the bottom and I'm

299
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,040
gonna hold ctrl to lock it onto the

300
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,899
vertical axis so that we end up with

301
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,279
something like that right there now let

302
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,560
me go back to the Select tool I want to

303
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,850
take this text I'm just gonna make this

304
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,959
a little lighter I'm just eyeballing

305
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,250
this here I don't

306
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,130
like how that looks before so that's

307
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,360
looking pretty good right there so

308
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,220
that's part one we have the text

309
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,530
finished let me click and drag over all

310
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,940
of this I want to group it together and

311
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,310
press ctrl G on the keyboard I'm going

312
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,630
to put this off to the side for now

313
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,550
maybe I'll even scale it down like that

314
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,940
hold ctrl and scale it down and now

315
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,150
we're going to create the emblem so let

316
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,030
me grab the actually first let me show

317
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,560
you the thumbnail here I'm gonna create

318
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,060
this emblem that you see in the

319
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,130
background to create that shape I'm

320
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,270
actually going to start off with this

321
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,740
square so let me show you how that works

322
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,790
I'm going to grab this squares and

323
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,250
rectangles tool I'm gonna hold ctrl +

324
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,900
Shift + click and drag on the cabbage to

325
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,670
create a perfectly symmetrical square

326
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,680
like that I just want to come up here to

327
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,480
where it says make Carter corner sharp

328
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
make sure that's enabled if you can't

329
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,170
click it and it's grayed out that means

330
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,710
you're good to go

331
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,960
we don't want rounded corners for we're

332
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,370
about to do here so it's important to

333
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,800
check that and let me convert that to a

334
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,310
path by going to path object to path and

335
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,660
I'll go to the nodes tool and I want to

336
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,130
add some new nodes in here I want to add

337
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,960
one right here and add one right there

338
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,380
so let me select those nodes click this

339
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,910
button up here to the top left that says

340
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,980
insert new nodes into selected segments

341
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,860
and then come down here do the same

342
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,890
thing and then I want to select these

343
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,150
two nodes right here the two new ones

344
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,390
and up here where it says show

345
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,350
transformation handles for selected

346
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,760
nodes let's go ahead and turn that on so

347
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,610
we can see the transformation because we

348
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,170
want to do is we want to hold ctrl down

349
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,750
and just hold ctrl and shift actually

350
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,180
and just scale them out like that pull

351
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,760
them out about that far that's looking

352
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,270
pretty good

353
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,800
and now I want to take these bottom ones

354
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,990
down here and hold ctrl and just scale

355
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,480
those down actually let me hold ctrl and

356
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,820
shift then I'll hold ctrl and move this

357
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,760
up like that that right there is what

358
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
we're looking for that's sort of it's

359
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,630
kind of like a squared shield kind of

360
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,610
shape now once you're done making that

361
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,400
shape you can go ahead and disable this

362
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,330
transformation handle because the next

363
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,920
time you go to Newton use the nodes tool

364
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
that will get in your way if you don't

365
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,910
need it so I like to always turn that

366
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,860
off when I'm done now let me take this

367
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,920
and scale this up a little bit let me

368
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,110
take the text actually and I'm gonna

369
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,080
raise this to the top and place it over

370
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,330
the emblem here let me Center them up on

371
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,980
the vertical

372
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,470
horizontal-axis like that I'm gonna take

373
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,240
just the text and hold ctrl and shift

374
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,019
and scale this up like that and I want

375
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,490
to take the shield right here and I want

376
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,730
to make it the same color as this dark

377
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,079
purple down here so I'm gonna grab the

378
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,449
dropper which is over here we can just

379
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:42,420
press D on the keyboard there you go and

380
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,389
now I want to create these little accent

381
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,010
pieces going on the inside of that

382
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,889
shield shape so to do that I'm going to

383
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,630
create a duplicate of this object I'm

384
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,070
going to right click and go to duplicate

385
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,540
and I'm going to make this the lighter

386
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,070
shade of purple so let me grab the

387
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,720
dropper again press D on the keyboard

388
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,519
and use this lighter shade as a

389
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,170
reference there we go back to the Select

390
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,420
tool and now I want to do another offset

391
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,820
so let me add a new path effect we're

392
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,190
gonna use offset again and I'm going to

393
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,050
use the - I'm going to shrink this down

394
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,019
like that and what I'm paying attention

395
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,310
to here is I want to make sure that the

396
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,589
thickness here this the padding between

397
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,750
the dark and the light here is pretty

398
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,449
much the same or close anyway to the

399
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,940
thickness of the wording here I want the

400
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,620
I want the padding to be consistent

401
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,690
between the shield and the text so you

402
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,810
may have to tweak that manually I'm not

403
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,610
using exact measurements or anything I'm

404
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,260
just going by how it looks on my screen

405
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,160
that's good enough so let me go to path

406
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,589
object to path and now what I'll do is

407
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,199
I'll create a duplicate of this

408
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,569
right-click it go to duplicate and I'm

409
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,279
just gonna make this a different color

410
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,769
for now maybe red bring the opacity down

411
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,720
it doesn't matter what color it is let

412
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,550
me hold ctrl and shift and scale this

413
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,850
down to make it smaller and then I'll go

414
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,339
back to the nodes tool up here select

415
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,490
these two nodes right here and then turn

416
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,560
the transformation handles back on and

417
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,540
then hold ctrl and shift and scale these

418
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,510
nodes up like that so that they surpass

419
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,110
so that they extend beyond the the white

420
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,209
via the lighter purple shape there which

421
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:21,990
is what we're going for

422
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,420
let me turn those off go back to the

423
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,060
Select tool hold shift click on the

424
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,230
other shape so we have them both

425
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,319
selected and go to path difference and

426
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,060
now we want them to be two different

427
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,430
colors so I'm going to go to path break

428
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,840
apart to break them apart and

429
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,000
separate pieces paths break apart and

430
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,170
let me click off of that to deselect

431
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,760
everything I'm gonna take this one right

432
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,680
here and make this the medium shade of

433
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,000
purple which is right here so let me

434
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,860
grab the dropper again just press D on

435
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,590
the keyboard and just click on that and

436
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,770
there to give that that same color maybe

437
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,020
a little lighter there we go

438
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,540
I'll grab the select tool take this text

439
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,360
item raise it to the top once again and

440
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,060
as you can see we are on our way we just

441
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,160
have to now create the controller

442
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,740
illustration so let me bring that in

443
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,480
here as you can see now now we're going

444
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,010
to create the controller the shape of

445
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,960
this controller is a very unique shape

446
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,330
there's no tool that makes that specific

447
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,470
shape and Inkscape so we're gonna

448
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,200
manually create it using ellipses so let

449
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,110
me move that off the screen we can do

450
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,240
now is you can take this and just hold

451
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,190
ctrl and shift to scale that down put it

452
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,140
off to the side for now may be a good

453
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,570
idea to save your work at this point in

454
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,790
case Inkscape crashes you don't want to

455
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,080
lose all of this that you've been

456
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,520
working on so I'm actually gonna do that

457
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,370
real quick myself okay so now that I've

458
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,930
saved my work let's create the

459
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,240
controller now so I'm gonna grab the

460
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,670
circles and ellipses tool I'm gonna

461
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,110
click and drag to create an ellipse like

462
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,300
that and while I'm creating this shape

463
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm just gonna for now make this black

464
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,930
and I'm gonna make sure the opacity is

465
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,220
down in half like that because we're

466
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,300
gonna be able to see through these

467
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,070
shapes I'm going to convert this to a

468
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,920
path by going to path object to path and

469
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,109
then I'm gonna grab the edit pads by

470
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,420
nodes tool and I want to take these two

471
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,430
nodes up here and hold ctrl and just

472
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,260
scale them up like that not too much

473
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,180
maybe up about that much and then I'll

474
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,040
take this node and hold ctrl and scale

475
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,470
that down a little bit now let me grab

476
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,390
this select tool I'm gonna make this a

477
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,160
little wider again I'm just eyeballing

478
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,720
us it doesn't have to be exactly like

479
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,430
what you see on my screen just something

480
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,410
there abouts is pretty good I'm gonna

481
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,329
click on this so I get the rotation

482
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,100
handles I'm gonna hold ctrl to take this

483
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,870
little hand on the top right corner and

484
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,810
I'm gonna rotate this clockwise one to

485
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,190
two steps like that

486
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,350
now let me duplicate that by pressing

487
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,810
ctrl D I want to flip this horizontally

488
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,600
and hold ctrl and move this over here

489
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,080
like that and now I want to grab the

490
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,820
ellipses tool again and I want to create

491
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,880
another ellipse

492
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,340
going through the inside here like this

493
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,350
make sure that this is oops make sure

494
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,640
this is going through to the other side

495
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,400
like that that's looking pretty good now

496
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,360
I just want to make sure that these

497
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,309
three shapes are spaced apart evenly

498
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,900
otherwise you'll get a little bit of

499
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,760
asymmetry here so let me select all

500
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,799
three of those and down here in the

501
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,840
align and distribute menu and under the

502
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,460
distribute panel you should see

503
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,200
something that says make horizontal gaps

504
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,850
between objects equal go ahead and click

505
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,490
on that and now we can unify this

506
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,150
together by going to path Union and we

507
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,429
have the beginning of a controller shape

508
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,710
but if you notice it's not quite there

509
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,270
yet if you notice on the thumbnail here

510
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,850
the controller shape dips down like that

511
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,620
and then it dips upward like that so to

512
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,970
do that we're gonna have to manually

513
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,100
create that shape so let me grab the

514
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,080
Edit path by nodes tool again and I'm

515
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,370
gonna take this note up here I'm gonna

516
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,080
click and drag this down actually

517
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,090
there's two nodes there's one cigar grab

518
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,919
both of those let me undo that with ctrl

519
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,010
Z if you end up having two nodes there

520
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,080
like I do just click and drag over both

521
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,510
of those and combine them together join

522
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,940
selected nodes there we go and then hold

523
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,559
ctrl and just click and drag them down

524
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,409
like that and then just take this handle

525
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,900
and make it adjust it so that it's this

526
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,610
line right here is going flush with the

527
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,799
rest of it don't worry about this side

528
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,270
we're actually gonna exclude this side

529
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,780
and duplicate this left side let's take

530
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,309
this one and do the same thing move this

531
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:19,020
up here like that adjust this handle

532
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,400
there we go now what I want to do is

533
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,799
hold ctrl and click on that node so that

534
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,510
it makes it automatically smooth I want

535
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,070
to do the same thing up here hold ctrl

536
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,559
click on this node I'm actually gonna

537
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,010
bring this up a little more there we go

538
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,780
now what I want to do is I want to

539
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,640
temporarily turn on snapping where it

540
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,429
says enable snapping turn that on and

541
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,750
over here where it says we're gonna want

542
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,250
this one that says snap to custom nodes

543
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,929
and then this one that says snap to

544
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,720
smooth nodes and I'm gonna grab the

545
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,690
Bezier pen over here or you could press

546
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,220
B on the keyboard I'm gonna snap to that

547
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,460
middle node that we just created and

548
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,690
click and then bring the line straight

549
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,460
down to the other node click on that and

550
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,710
then finish this shape up going around

551
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,140
the outside of the controller here and

552
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,380
that

553
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,630
the starting point now I want to grab

554
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,200
this select tool hold shift click on the

555
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,190
controller and go to path difference and

556
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,140
now we have half of a controller so what

557
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,770
I'm going to do is I'm going to

558
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,300
duplicate that right click go to

559
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,470
duplicate flip it horizontally and then

560
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,390
snap it on to the left side over here so

561
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,830
that we end up with this symmetrical

562
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,190
shape now let me turn off the snapping

563
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,270
now so that it doesn't get in the way

564
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,430
for the rest of the way and I want to

565
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,990
click and drag over both of those and go

566
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,780
to path Union and we now have our

567
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,180
controller shape so now it's time to add

568
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,320
some buttons and some some simulated

569
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,030
lighting effects in here a little bit of

570
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,070
shading and some buttons so to do that

571
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,340
let's first add these buttons down here

572
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,890
grab the circles and ellipses tool hold

573
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,200
ctrl and shift create a perfectly round

574
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,130
circle put that right there and then I

575
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,900
want to duplicate that by pressing ctrl

576
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,550
D instead of right-clicking and going to

577
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,110
duplicate we're just going to press ctrl

578
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,660
D just easier to do that make this red

579
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,600
just for now hold ctrl ctrl and shift

580
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,390
scale that down and now I want to take

581
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,120
both of those and group them together

582
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,980
and I want to duplicate that by pressing

583
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,440
ctrl D again hold ctrl and click and

584
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,760
drag these over here so that we have a

585
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,800
copy over here and again we want to make

586
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,480
sure that this is centered up on the

587
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,380
controller so let's group those together

588
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,090
with that group button up there hold

589
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,340
shift click on the controller and then

590
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,720
again just make sure they're centered up

591
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,250
on the vertical axis like that I might

592
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,770
even make these a little bigger bring

593
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,910
them down a little more okay that looks

594
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,390
pretty good

595
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,890
now I'm gonna ungroup those actually no

596
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,450
there we go this is the ungroup button

597
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,040
just you'll have to click it a few times

598
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,930
because it's grouped several layers deep

599
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,550
so we'll have to do like a deep ungroup

600
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,060
on that what we can do now is let's

601
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,520
create the D pad over here and the

602
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
buttons over here so let me grab the

603
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,740
squares and rectangles tool zoom back in

604
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,090
just create a very simple very simple

605
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,330
rectangle like that let me zoom in I'm

606
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,920
gonna use this little rounded node at

607
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,020
the top right to make this to make the

608
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,550
edges of that rounded and then I'll take

609
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,200
this note up here and bring that in life

610
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,120
like that so that we end up with

611
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,390
slightly rounded rectangle a slightly

612
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,420
rounded rectangle like that right click

613
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,860
that go to duplicate and then we're just

614
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,540
gonna rotate that 90 degrees with this

615
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,760
button that says rotate selection 90

616
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,600
degrees clockwise there we go I actually

617
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,090
don't like how that button how this came

618
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,860
out so emotionally to delete that I'm

619
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,750
going to grab the nodes tool this is a

620
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,250
little too elongated so I'm going to

621
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,280
convert this to a path path object to

622
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,720
path this is all optional you don't have

623
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
to do it what i'm doing here i'm just

624
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,140
being meticulous at this point i'm gonna

625
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,240
take those nodes bring them up a little

626
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,460
bit with the arrow keys and i'll do the

627
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,910
same thing again control d rotate it 90

628
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,770
degrees and that looks a little better

629
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,560
i'll just go with that select both of

630
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,680
them go to path Union now let me just

631
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,150
scale that down a little bit put that

632
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,830
right here now I want to put a little

633
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,960
circle behind this but behind this as

634
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,250
well if I bring this back in you'll

635
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,230
notice there's a circle behind the d-pad

636
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,510
and a circle behind the button so let me

637
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,150
create a circle control and shift to

638
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,560
make a perfectly round circle I'm going

639
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,150
to make this it's gonna make this green

640
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,030
for now layer this beneath the d-pad

641
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,370
with the button up here that says lower

642
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,160
selection one step hold shift click on

643
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,570
that and just make sure to Center it up

644
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,430
on the vertical and horizontal axis like

645
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,050
that I'll move this up here I'm gonna

646
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,060
make this a little bigger then I'll take

647
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,310
this green circle duplicate that by

648
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,980
pressing control D and hold ctrl to move

649
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,420
this over here and now we can create

650
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,760
some buttons so let me create more

651
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,010
circles over here ctrl and shift I'll

652
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,110
make that red I just want to Center this

653
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,880
up make sure it's centered within the

654
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,790
circle there take this circle control D

655
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,260
to duplicate it bring this one down here

656
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,450
shift-click both of them and then group

657
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,590
them together ctrl D to duplicate click

658
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,330
on it again to get the rotation handles

659
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,550
and then hold ctrl and rotate this

660
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,650
counter or clockwise rather until you

661
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,840
end up with buttons going in all four

662
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,210
directions like that and that's what

663
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,620
we're looking for so let me hold shift

664
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,630
and click on both of those I want to

665
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,160
group them together

666
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,930
shift-click on the circle and center

667
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,280
that up within the circle and the

668
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,880
vertical and horizontal axis and what

669
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,290
I'm gonna do now is now that we have our

670
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,160
buttons in place I want to add I want to

671
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,020

everything let's bring the opacity all

678
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,620
the way up like that let's take the

679
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,420
controller and make this the medium

680
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,080
shade of purple which is over here grab

681
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,610
press D on the keyboard to grab the

682
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:09,730
dropper there we go go back to the

683
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,440
Select tool I want to make this I want

684
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,730
to make these black circles the same

685
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,020
shade as well so I'm gonna press D to

686
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,950
get the dropper back to the Select tool

687
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,010
D for the dropper there we go and now I

688
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,450
want to go back to the Select tool I

689
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,960
want to take this D pad these joysticks

690
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,250
over here and these buttons and make

691
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,870
them the same shade as a dark purple

692
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,940
here so let me shift click all of that

693
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,990
I'm gonna make sure I have all of that

694
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,660
selected and then I'll come over here

695
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,420
and again D for the dropper and make

696
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,190
this the dark shade of purple like that

697
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,990
that's what I'm going for it

698
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,450
and now back to the select tool let's

699
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,120
take this green shape hold shift grab

700
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,390
this green shape hold shift grab this

701
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,670
circle down here and then this circle

702
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,930
down here as well and make this the

703
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,270
light shade of purple so once again

704
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,770
press D on the keyboard to grab the

705
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,600
dropper there we go and now we have that

706
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,100
colored in the final part of the

707
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,770
controller here is to add these little

708
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,120
these little shading these little this

709
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,220
little shading effect here so let me

710
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,050
take this controller object right here

711
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,210
I want to duplicate that by pressing

712
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,690
control D I want to make this green or

713
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,130
whatever color you want just some kind

714
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,630
of contrasting color I want to bring the

715
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,570
opacity down like that and once again

716
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,130
we're going to use the offset path

717
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,390
effect so I'm going to add a new path

718
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,550
effect right back to offset over here

719
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,440
and where it says offset I'm just gonna

720
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,680
use this minus symbol make this a little

721
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,580
smaller like that

722
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,460
that's what we're looking for now let me

723
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,410
finalise that I actually make it a

724
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,160
little smaller

725
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,750
now let me finalise that by going to

726
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,050
path object to path and then let me

727
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,060
duplicate this by pressing ctrl D and

728
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,740
I'll make this red and I'm just going to

729
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,100
move this up up like this I'm gonna hold

730
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,370
ctrl and just scale that up a little bit

731
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,370
when I'm paying attention to here is the

732
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,430
little piece that's extending from

733
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,350
little green piece that's extending from

734
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,180
underneath the red object here that's

735
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,270
gonna make up the lighting effect so I'm

736
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,130
gonna go with I'm gonna go with the

737
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,080
positioning like that hold shift click

738
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,140
on the green object and go to path

739
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,180
difference so now I just want to keep

740
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,830
this object here I want to get rid of

741
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,450
this so let me break them apart by going

742
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,180
to path break apart click off of it to

743
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,740
deselect everything and just take this

744
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,080
and get rid of it I'm gonna take this

745
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,780
object bring the opacity all the way up

746
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,240
and make this the same color that this

747
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,620
is right here so once again we're

748
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,300
grabbing the dropper tool press D on the

749
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,900
keyboard make that the same color and

750
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,540
now I could just duplicate this object

751
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,880
ctrl D flip it horizontally and then

752
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,020
just place it over here on the other

753
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,870
side like that and then finally I'm

754
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,310
gonna put one more piece right here so

755
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,850
let me duplicate this object again make

756
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,880
this green bring the opacity down and

757
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,810
come back over here to the path effects

758
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,690
menu and add another offset bring this

759
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,970
down right about there roughly the same

760
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,070
as we did before finalize that by going

761
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,340
to path object to path and then I want

762
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,680
to duplicate this control D turn this

763
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,960
red and then I'm just gonna take this

764
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,280
bottom arrow and click and drag that

765
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,110
down like this and I'm going to hold

766
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,880
ctrl and bring this up here like that

767
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,830
and again when I'm paying attention to

768
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,960
is right here this little green part

769
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,860
that's it's excluded from the rest of it

770
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,270
I'm gonna hold shift click on the green

771
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,830
object so we haven't both selected and

772
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,670
go to path difference and then we can go

773
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,140
to path break apart hold shift and click

774
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,370
on this little piece right here to

775
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,960
deselect it though we only have these

776
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,520
two pieces selected then I could press

777
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,690
Delete on the keyboard to get rid of

778
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,080
them

779
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,530
and now I want to take this object bring

780
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,510
the opacity up and once again we're

781
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,890
grabbing the dropper and making that the

782
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,870
same shade so okay so now the controller

783
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,460
is finished we have all of our

784
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,430
individual objects finished I'm going to

785
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,530
click and drag over everything over the

786
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,430
controller rather group it together

787
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,930
let's bring it over here I'm gonna hold

788
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,580
ctrl and shift and scale it down it's

789
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,380
time to put everything together now the

790
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,270
place that's right over here I'm sizing

791
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,940
it up so that it fits within here nicely

792
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,740
but then the top parts of the controller

793
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,040
are expanding beyond the emblem they're

794
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,660
just a little bit not by much but just a

795
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,700
little bit and one thing out one more

796
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,780
thing I want to do for the controller

797
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,340
here if you notice I have a little bit

798
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,110
of a I have some padding going around

799
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,400
the controller so I want to do that as

800
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
well I want to add some padding around

801
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,880
there first let me Center it up with the

802
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,410
idiot with the emblem here I'm gonna

803
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,940
hold shift and click on the emblem and

804
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,860
just make sure it's centered up on the

805
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,890
vertical axis like that now I can click

806
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,770
on the controller let's ungroup it click

807
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,470
off at the deselect let's take the

808
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,660
controller shape right here duplicate

809
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,000
that by pressing ctrl D I want to make

810
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,490
this the same shade as the dark purple

811
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,440
here let me just grab the dropper tool

812
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,780
by pressing D make that the same color

813
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,210
back to the select tool and now I'm just

814
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,710
going to lower this until it goes

815
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,060
beneath the controller there so I'm

816
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,150
gonna lower it one step at a time until

817
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,560
it goes beneath the controller there we

818
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,310
go and then we'll add an offset and path

819
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:29,580
effect offset and I'm going to increase

820
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,640
this offset and again what I'm paying

821
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
attention to here is the thickness of

822
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,870
this padding making sure it's consistent

823
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,340
with the thickness of this padding and

824
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,360
this padding over here we want

825
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,620
everything to look nice and consistent

826
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,870
like it all belongs together nice fluid

827
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,790
looking there we go

828
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,950
now let me go to path object to path to

829
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,720
finalize that and let me just take all

830
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,520
of this right here the whole controller

831
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,740
with the padding and just group it all

832
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,920
together

833
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,720
there we go I'm just gonna scale it down

834
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,620
a little bit we just double-check make

835
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,060
sure I have it centered there we go

836
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,880
so we have the design finished for the

837
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,350
most part I'm actually gonna make the

838
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,170
text a little larger there we go

839
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,510
you may have to adjust the sizing based

840
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,160
on how your design came out I'm just

841
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,220
gonna manually tweak this a little bit

842
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,830
the final part now would be to add this

843
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,750
yellow outline going around the entire

844
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,460
design just to tie everything together

845
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,710
so to do that let's take everything

846
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,390
let's press control D on the keyboard to

847
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,610
duplicate everything and let's do a deep

848
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,530
on group click the ungroup button a few

849
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,000
times to make sure it's all ungrouped

850
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,900
and go to path Union and now I'm gonna

851
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,120
make this yellow because it contrasts

852
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,400
nicely with the purple there and I want

853
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600
to send this to the bottom where it says

854
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,240
lower selection to the bottom and then

855
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,220
finally one last time we will add an

856
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,760
offset path effect so but by this point

857
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,380
I'm sure you're pretty familiar with

858
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,520
this path effect we're just gonna add

859
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:06,190
this in manually like that that right

860
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,050
there looks pretty good now we can just

861
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,780
finalize this by going to path object to

862
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,690
path and there you go we are finished

863
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,580
with this tutorial there you have your

864
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,370
eSports logo design made with Inkscape

865
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,230
