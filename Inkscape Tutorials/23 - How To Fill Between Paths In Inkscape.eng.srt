1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,340
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,440
you can fill between paths using

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,899
inkscape and to show you what I mean I

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,480
have this series of individual lines on

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,340
my screen here if I grab my nodes tool

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,900
you can see these are just independent

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,099
paths

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,100
and if I select all of these paths and

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,220
try to apply a fill color you can see

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,439
that nothing happens there because these

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,060
shapes between these paths aren't

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,100
actually shapes this is just empty space

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,779
that takes on the appearance of a shape

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,599
so if I want to fill in these spaces we

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,820
have to use a different approach

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,200
so there's actually several different

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,239
ways that you can do this and the method

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,620
that you should use depends on which

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,540
result you're going for so let's have a

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,879
closer look if I select all of these

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,879
shapes right here I can go to path and

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,340
choose fracture

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,200
and what happens is it creates

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
independent shapes out of all of those

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
empty spaces there and now you can just

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,960
select them and go and change their

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,760
colors as you'd like

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,620
another way that you can do this is by

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,780
using the shape Builder tool if I select

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,219
all of these shapes and go into the

31
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,080
shape Builder tool I can get the same

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,119
result as fracture the only difference

33
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,340
now is that I can make I can combine

34
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,200
some of these shapes together so I can

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
create this cube-like effect like that

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,780
now the problem with using this approach

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,659
is that it doesn't just fill in those

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,939
empty spaces it also gets rid of the uh

39
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,680
the lines that I had there so if you

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,240
want to do this in such a way that you

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,580
can fill between these paths and still

42
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,920
preserve these paths one way to do that

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,439
would be to use the paint bucket tool so

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm going to come over here and grab the

45
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,140
paint bucket tool in the in the toolbar

46
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,700
you can also access it by pressing the

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,500
letter U on your keyboard

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,060
and we'll come up here to the tool

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,860
settings menu and make sure you have the

50
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,500
fill by set to visible colors make sure

51
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,960
your threshold is set to 50. we'll start

52
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,640
out at 50 and if we need to adjust it

53
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,340
we'll increase or decrease it grow and

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,840
Shrink make sure you have that set to

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
zero and close gaps set to none

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,420
now you can choose a fill color that

57
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,520
you'd like to use it's indicated up here

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,079
in the top right corner you can see as

59
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,020
of right now green is my fill color if I

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,460
want to change my fill color I could

61
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,960
just come down here to the color bar and

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,639
pick one of these other colors

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,979
and now if I click on one of these empty

64
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,680
spaces it fills in that empty space with

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,300
the new Vector shape

66
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,160
now if I zoom in on this you can see

67
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,680
where this effect is not perfect you can

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
see there are a little bit of gaps in

69
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,580
there it didn't exactly fill it in

70
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,560
precisely so let me undo that by

71
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,720
pressing Ctrl Z or command Z if you're

72
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,640
on Mac and I'm going to come up here to

73
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,860
the tool settings what we can choose to

74
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,319
do is we can choose to grow or Shrink

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,060
The Fill using this setting right here

76
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,480
so if I increase this to 0.7

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,459
and try that again

78
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,860
you can see it fills it in better as you

79
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,840
can see there but the problem now is

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,180
that it's overlapping some of the path

81
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,220
here so what you'll want to do is grab

82
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,319
your select tool and then just lower

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
this beneath the pads like that and now

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,379
you can grab the paint bucket tool again

85
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,280
and proceed to fill in the other colors

86
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,959
now if you want to change colors while

87
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,459
you're filling them in make sure to

88
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,739
press the Escape key so you can deselect

89
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,060
whatever object you currently have

90
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,099
selected and then you can choose your

91
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,599
next color like that

92
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,220
and then press Escape when you want to

93
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
choose another color again

94
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,300
and then you could fill it like that

95
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,920
okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
going to take all of my shapes here I'm

97
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,560
going to select them all

98
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,459
and I'm going to send them all to the

99
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,739
back so that we can see the paths on top

100
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:29,580
of them

101
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
and you can see again this approach is

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,900
not perfect we have these gaps in here

103
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,360
despite using despite changing those

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,920
settings so I'm going to grab my nodes

105
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,420
tool and I'm going to take these nodes

106
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,360
and move them and adjust them so that

107
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
everything here is filled in accurately

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
and there we go foreign

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,340
so one thing to keep in mind when using

110
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,379
the paint bucket tool is if I fill in

111
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,480
this shape right here I have a shape but

112
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,519
if I try doing that over here it doesn't

113
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,560
work and the reason why is because if I

114
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,540
zoom in you can see there is a gap

115
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,819
between these paths here meaning this is

116
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,340
all open space the paint bucket tool

117
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,220
mostly only works on closed spaces there

118
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,019
are no gaps here so it worked over here

119
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,120
there is a setting that you can use to

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,680
change this though so if I come up here

121
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
to the tool settings where it says close

122
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,699
gaps I can start off with small and see

123
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,680
if that works so I'll set it to small

124
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
and click on it

125
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,759
okay so this is this must be larger than

126
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,500
what inkscapes considers to be a small

127
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,060
Gap so I'm going to try medium now

128
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
because that didn't work so let's try

129
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,759
medium

130
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,979
there we go

131
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,620
and this time it works so based on the

132
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,240
size of the of the gaps between your

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
paths go ahead and cycle through those

134
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
options there to see if one of those

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
will work if you're encountering that

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
problem

137
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,100
so all of the methods that we've gone

138
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,840
over at this point have been imperfect

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
in some way let's go over a workflow

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,280
that is perfect what I'm going to do is

141
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm going to select my paths here and

142
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,639
I'm going to combine them together by

143
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,780
going to path and selecting combine

144
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,000
now I'm going to duplicate that I'm

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,620
going to right click it and go to

146
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,720
duplicate

147
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,240
and now I'm going to apply the fracture

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,759
to this duplicated path here so I'll go

149
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,240
to path and select fracture

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,699
and now I can change the colors of my

151
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,979
shapes and I could remove The Stroke by

152
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,720
holding shift and clicking on this red X

153
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,000
over here and now I can send them to the

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,639
back and this workflow right here gives

155
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,740
you the best result the only problem

156
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,900
with this method here is that now you

157
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,340
have to go and change all of these

158
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,860
colors individually if you need the

159
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,419
colors to be different

160
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,280
so that is how you can go about filling

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,220
between paths using inkscape if you

162
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
found this lesson useful then consider

163
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,820
checking out my inkscape master class

164
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,039
it's a collection of over 60 videos

165
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,660
where I go over all of the tools and

166
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,639
features in inkscape and I explain what

167
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,199
they are and demonstrate how they work

168
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,780
kind of like how I did in this video we

169
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,520
even have a private Community where you

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,259
can ask questions and get help from me

171
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,780
anytime you want and best of all there's

172
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,759
no monthly membership fees you just pay

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,180
17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

174
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,500
have some information about that down

175
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,180
below if you want to check that out as

176
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,820
always thanks for watching foreign
