this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this  distressed  text

effect

using  inkscape  but  before  we  get  started

if  youd  like  to  learn  more  about  how

inkscape  works  be  sure  to  check  out  my

inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  set  up

our  document  so  that  we  are  all  working

with  a  similar  workflow

to  do  that  ill  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  view  make  sure  we  have  custom

selected

and  then  go  to  zoom  and  where  it  says  go

to  view  zoom  and  were  looking  for  zoom

one  to  one

like  that  and  for  this  tutorial  were

going  to  want  to  disable  snapping  which

is  up  here  this

icon  in  the  top  left  hand  corner  just

click  on  that  to  disable  it

if  you  already  have  it  deselected  then

youre  good  to  go  and  then  finally  we

want  to  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

which  is  over  here

or  you  could  press  the  uh  you  could

press  ctrl  shift  and  f  on  the  keyboard

to  open  that  up

so  the  first  thing  im  going  to  do  is

create  some  text  so  let  me  grab  the  text

tool  over  here

click  on  the  canvas  and  for  this

tutorial  im  just  going  to  use  a  capital

letter  g

you  can  use  whatever  letter  or  number

you  want  though

and  im  going  to  change  the  font  of  this

im  going  to  click  on  the  text  editor  up

here  this  little  t

icon  and  im  going  to  change  this  to

league

gothic  you  dont  have  to  use  this  font

you  could  use  whatever  font  youd  like

it  should  work  just  fine  with  this

tutorial  and  let  me  grab  the  select  tool

over  here

and  let  me  just  scale  this  up  oops  not

like  that  let  me  grab  this  arrow  right

here  then  hold  ctrl

to  lock  the  proportions  put  this  towards

the  center  of  the  page  scale  it  up  a

little  more

thats  looking  pretty  good  and  now  what

i  want  to  do  is  convert  this  from  a  text

object  to  a  path  so  that  we  can  edit  it

further

to  do  that  ill  go  to  path  object  to

path

and  then  click  on  the  ungroup  button

over  here  which  is  uh  this  icon  that

says  ungroup  or  you  could

press  ctrl  shift  and  g

now  i  will  take  the  opacity  and  bring

this  down  roughly  in  half

and  in  order  to  give  this  the  distressed

effect  were  going  to  do  two  different

things  to  it

number  one  were  going  to  roughen  the

edges  so  it  looks  more  whimsical

and  number  two  were  going  to  add  a

vector  texture  to  the  center  of  the

letter  here

so  starting  first  with  the  the  rough  the

roughened  edges  to  do  that  im  going  to

grab  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

and  what  were  looking  at  is  the  number

of  nodes  here  in  the  letter  if  you

notice

during  in  this  curve  over  here  we  have  a

lot  of  nodes  but  in  this  straight  line

we  dont  have

very  many  nodes  at  all  so  what  we  want

to  do  is  add  some  new  nodes  in  here

by  double  clicking  these  lines  so  that

its  more  consistent  with  the  rest  of

the  design

because  the  way  were  going  to  roughen

these  edges  is  by  altering  the  position

of  these  nodes  using  an  extension  which

im  going  to  show  you  in  just  a  minute

so

go  ahead  and  add  some  new  nodes  where

they  are  needed  so  that  it  looks  more

consistent  all  the  way  through  maybe

ill  put  one  here

another  one  right  here

and  id  say  thats  looking  pretty  good

right  there  so  well  go  back  to  the

select  tool

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  go  to

extensions  modify  path

and  click  on  jitter  nodes  and  im  going

to  use  these  presets  right  here

1.0  1.0  shift  node  selected

shift  node  handles  deselected  uniform

and  go  ahead  and  click  live  preview  to

see  how  it  looks

now  the  numbers  that  you  should  use  here

depend  entirely  on  the  size  of  your

letter  if  you  notice  here

displacing  these  two  axis  at  one  pixel

is  perfect  it  looks  good  right  there  if

this  were  too  high  lets  say  if  i  had

something  like  10

it  would  look  something  like  that  or

thats  not  thats  not  thats  thats  too

much  it  doesnt  even  look  like  a  letter

anymore  so  i  want  to  lower  that  to  1.

now  im  mentioning  this  because  youre

probably  going  to  have  to  use  a

different  value

other  than  one  in  order  to  get  this

result  so  make  sure  to  play  around  with

these  numbers  a  little  bit  to  see  what

gets  the  best  result

what  were  looking  for  is  this  right

here  where  the  edges  just  look  a  little

roughened  like  that  thats  perfect  as  it

is  so

ill  click  apply  then  close  out  of  that

and  now  we  want  to  do  is  apply  a  texture

to  this  letter

but  i  dont  want  to  apply  the  texture  to

the  entire  letter  i  want  it

to  only  be  applied  to  the  center  of  the

letter  here  the  middle  portion  so  im

going  to  create  a  duplicate  of  this

letter  and  then  offset  it

to  make  it  smaller  and  then  use  that  as

the  reference  selection

for  applying  the  texture  so  im  going  to

right  click  this  object  and  go  to

duplicate

and  im  going  to  make  this  green  just  so

we  can  differentiate  it

and  im  going to  come  up  here  to  where

it  says  path  and  im  going  to  click  on

simplify  to  get  rid  of  some  of  those

nodes  that  we  added

and  then  well  come  over  here  and  go  to

path  and  i  will  look  for

dynamic  offset  and  now  i  want  to  take

this  little  node  up  here  and  just  bring

this  down

so  that  we  have  this  smaller  version  of

the  letter

inside  of  it  like  that  and  that  green

area  thats  where  we  want  the  texture  to

be  applied

so  lets  finalize  that  by  going  to  path

object  to  path

go  back  to  the  select  tool  and  now  what

i  want  to  do  is  import  a  vector  texture

i  will  have  this  linked  in  the

description  of  the  video  to  where  you

can  go  and  download  this  svg  texture  so

you  can  work  with  it  im  just  going  to

open  up  the  folder  here  on  my  other

monitor  and  uh

well  ill  show  you  over  here  i  have  this

open  like  this  im  going  to  take  this

scratch.svg  and  im  just  going  to  click

and  drag  that  into  inkscape  like  that

and  its  going  to  ask  all  of  this  stuff

im  just  going  to  leave  the  defaults

click  ok

and  there  is  our  let  me  zoom  out  a

little  bit  to  zoom  out  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  roll  down  the  mouse  wheel

there  is  our  vector  texture  now  let  me

position  this  over  the  green  area  if  you

notice  where  the  red

and  the  green  are  intersecting  thats

going  to  be  the  area  where  the

the  texture  is  applied  to  the  letter  so

i  just  want  to  make  sure  i  have  it

positioned  where  i  want  it

that  right  there  looks  pretty  good  so

im  going  to  hold  im  going  to  click  on

this  green  letter  to  select  that

and  then  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  red  texture

and  with  them  both  selected  ill  go  to

path  intersection

and  then  ill  hold  shift  and  click  on

the  letter  and  go  to  path

difference  and  what  we  can  do  now  is

bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  back  up

and  zoom  out  and  as  you  can  see  we  are

finished  that  is  how  you  can

pretty  easily  create  a  distressed  text

effect  using  inkscape  so

if  you  have  any  questions  just  leave  a

comment  below  and  as  always  thanks  for
