Inkscape  recently  introduced  version  1.0

as  a  new  release  and  this  was  not  your

typical  update  this  new  release  comes

packed  with  lots  of  new  features  and

functionality  that  might  make  your  life

a  little  easier  as  an  Inkscape  user  Ill

have  a  link  in  the  description  to  the

wiki  page  with  a  complete  list  of  all

the  new  features  and  updates  added  if

you  want  to  check  that  out  but  in  this

video  Id  just  like  to  go  over  a  few  of

those  features  that  Im  really  excited

about  in  particular  and  if  you  are

enrolled  in  my  Inkscape  masterclass  I

have  updated  the  course  contents

according  to  the  new  release  and  if

youre  not  enrolled  maybe  consider

checking  it  out  if  you  want  to  learn

more  about  Inkscape  Ill  have  a  link  in

the  description  for  more  information

about  that  as  well

to  get  us  started  Inkscape  has

officially  added  support  for  theme

customization  gone  are  the  days  where  we

had  to  tinker  with  system  files  and

perform  other  types  of  voodoo  magic  just

to  get  a  more  visually  appealing  dark

theme  with  a  more  modern  icon  pack  its

now  built  right  in  you  can  just  navigate

to  edit  preferences  and  click  on  theme

under  the  interface  tab  and  from  there

you  can  choose  from  a  variety  of  themes

and  yes  that  does  include  a  dark  theme

not  only  that  but  you  can  also  switch  to

a  more  modern  icon  pack  with  the

monochromatic  style  that  looks  more  like

it  belongs  in  the  year  2020  you  can  even

go  as  far  as  changing  the  color  of  those

icons  if  you  so  desire

one  new  feature  that  Im  really  excited

about  an  Inkscape  version  1.0  has  to  do

with  the  text  tool  if  you  generate  some

text  on  your  canvas  youll  notice  that

theres  now  a  little  note  on  the  bottom

right  side  of  your  text  item  clicking

and  dragging  that  node  will  allow  you  to

determine  where  a  line  of  text  should

end  this  will  be  really  useful  when

designing  things  like  brochures  where

you  have  to  confine  your  text  to  a

specific  vertical  column  you  wont  have

to  worry  about  making  the  bounding  box

of  that  text  fit  that  column  any  longer

you  can  simply  adjust  that  node  to  make

your  lines  of  text  end  exactly  where  you

want

those  of  you  who  use  illustrator  may

already  be  familiar  with  the  concept  of

outline  mode  which  allows  you  to  view

your  design  as  somewhat  of  a  skeleton

where  you  can  see  all  of  the  individual

paths  and  boundaries  that  make  up  a

design  without  fill  colors  and  other

design  elements  getting  in  the  way  this

is  useful  because  sometimes  you  need  to

select  or  work  with  a  particular  object

but  you  cant  select  it  because  you

dont  know  where  it  is  because  its

positioned  beneath  other  objects  with

fill  data  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why

I  tend  to  make  objects  with  partial

transparency  when  Im  designing

something  you  just  need  to  be  able  to

know  where  things  are  sometimes  and

Inkscape  has  now  made  that  easier  with

their  own  version  of  outline  mode  and

Ill  even  go  as  far  as  saying  that

theyve  outdone  illustrator  with  this

update  because  it  offers  a  lot  more

versatility  the  first  way  you  can  view

your  work  in  outline  mode  is  by

navigating  to  the  View  menu  and  clicking

on  x-ray  mode  this  will  allow  you  to  use

your  cursor  as  somewhat  of  a  viewfinder

where  you  can  hover  it  over  specific

areas  of  your  design  to  see  all  of  the

individual  outlines  the  second  way  you

can  view  your  design  is  outlines  is  by

navigating  to  the  View  menu  and

selecting  split  view  mode  this  will

generate  a  guide  through  the  center  of

your  screen

that  will  show  how  your  design  normally

looks  on  one  side  and  how  it  looks  an

outline  mode  on  the  other  side  you  can

move  the  guide  around  by  clicking  and

dragging  it  and  you  can  also  change  the

orientation  and  position  of  your  guide

by  clicking  on  the  individual  arrows

if  you  open  up  your  align  and  distribute

menu  youll  notice  a  new  icon  in  the  top

left  portion  of  the  menu  labeled  enable

on  canvas  alignment  handles  if  you  hover

your  cursor  over  it  enabling  that  icon

will  allow  you  to  align  objects  directly

on  the  canvas  without  having  to  use  the

alignment  menu  interface  the  way  that  it

works  is  that  you  select  the  objects

youd  like  to  align  click  on  them  once

to  display  the  rotation  handles  then

click  on  them  a  second  time  to  display

the  new  alignment  handles  then  from

there  you  can  simply  click  on  those

handles  to  align  your  objects  the  same

way  you  normally  would  in  the  align  and

distribute  menu  this  is  a  unique  feature

that  I  have  not  seen  anywhere  else  and

its  one  of  those  things  that  you  didnt

know  you  needed  until  you  tried  it

another  new  feature  that  I  know  Ill  be

using  a  lot  is  the  new  offset  live  path

effect  this  functions  very  similarly  to

the  standard  dynamic  offset  path

operation  only  with  one  very  big

improvement  and  that  is  that  it  now

allows  you  to  maintain  sharp  corners

to  see  what  I  mean  if  you  were  to

perform  a  dynamic  offset  on  an  object

with  sharp  corners  like  a  star  youll

notice  that  the  corners  become  rounded

as  you  offset  the  object  this  is  fine

for  objects  with  rounded  corners  but

its  useless  in  scenarios  where  you  need

to  maintain  the  sharp  corners  of  an

object  my  workaround  for  dealing  with

this  in  the  past  was  to  offset  the

object  by  adding  a  stroke  with  sharp

corners  then  convert  the  stroke  to  a

path  to  work  with  it  further  now  those

days  are  over  thanks  to  the  new  offset

live  path  effect  which  allows  you  to

maintain  sharp  corners  on  an  object  as

you  offset  it  to  access  the  new  feature

select  the  object  youd  like  to  offset

then  navigates  a  path  and  path  effects

to  bring  up  the  path  effects  window  then

click  on  the  little  plus  sign  to  add  a

new  path  effects  and  from  the  path

effects  menu  search  for  offset  and  apply

that  then  you  can  grab  the  edit  pads  by

nodes  tool  and  use  the  little  node  to

offset  your  object  while  maintaining

sharp  corners

excape  version  1.0  comes  with  lots  of

welcomed  improvements  like  support  for

high-resolution  displays  if  youre  using

a  4k  monitor  youll  actually  be  able  to

see  the  user  interface  now  theres  also

some  other  subtle  changes  like  in  the

way  that  stroke  to  path  works  when  you

convert  a  stroke  to  a  path  it  now

retains  the  fill  segment  of  that  stroke

as  a  separate  object  like  I  mentioned

earlier  theres  lots  of  new  updates  and

details  to  comb  through  so  be  sure  to

check  out  that  wiki  page  for  a  complete

overview  let  me  know  what  you  think  of

the  new  version  of  Inkscape  in  the

comments  below  and  as  always  thanks  for
