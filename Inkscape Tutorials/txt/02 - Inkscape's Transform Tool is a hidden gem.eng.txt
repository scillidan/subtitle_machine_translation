in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  going  over  how

you  can  use  the  transform  tool  in

inkscape  Ill  first  be  going  over  a

quick  demonstration  of  what  it  is  and

how  it  works  and  then  Ill  show  you  an

example  of  how  to  create  something

interesting  with  it  like  Ive  done  here

with  this  spiraling  hexagon  design

before  we  get  started  though  if  you  want

to  learn  more  about  how  inkscape  Works

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  80

videos  where  we  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  Im  doing  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  Ill  have  some

information  about  that  down  below  in  the

description  if  you  want  to  check  that

out  and  with  that  out  of  the  way  lets

get  started  so  I  have  this  example

graphic  placed  on  my  document  here  and

Im  going  to  open  up  the  transform  menu

by  going  to  object  and  selecting

transform  and  it  should  open  up  over

here  on  the  right  hand  side  of  your

screen  now  what  the  transform  tool  does

is  it  allows  you  to  make  basic

transformations  to  objects  that  you

would  normally  make  with  the  selection

tool  only  it  allows  you  to  do  it  using

numerical  values  so  if  you  come  over

here  to  the  top  you  can  see  these  tabs

we  have  these  different  options  for

moving  scaling  rotating  skewing  and

Matrix  were  going  to  ignore  the  Matrix

one  for  this  demonstration  Im  just

going  to  show  you  how  these  other  ones

work  so  lets  say  I  have  this  object  on

my  page  and  I  want  to  move  it  over  a

certain  number  of  pixels  you  can

normally  move  objects  by  just  clicking

and  dragging  but  the  problem  with  doing

it  that  way  is  that  you  dont  get  a

precise  movement  lets  say  I  wanted  to

move  this  over  exactly  50  pixels  I  can

can  come  over  here  to  the  horizontal

input  and  type  in  50  and  then  come  down

here  and  click  apply  and  you  can  see  it

moves  the  object  over  50  pixels  so  let

me  undo  what  I  just  did  right  there  let

me  reset  this  value  and  now  Ill  show

you  how  scale  works  scale  is  useful

because  normally  when  you  want  to  scale

an  object  by  a  certain  numerical  value

you  would  use  the  width  and  height

inputs  in  the  toolbar  up  top  so  if  I

wanted  to  scale  this  down  to  400  pixels

wide  I  would  type  that  in  and  press

enter  and  you  can  see  it  scales  it  down

but  the  the  problem  with  using  this

approach  is  that  it  takes  the  object  off

of  the  center  of  its  axis  so  if  you

notice  the  object  is  no  longer  in  the

center  of  my  document  it  now  went  to  the

top  left  because  with  these  inputs  up

here  it  scales  the  object  from  the

bottom  right  to  the  top  left  now  if  I

undo  that  itll  put  it  back  in  the

center  the  benefit  of  using  the

transform  tool  is  that  it  allows  you  to

scale  the  object  using  the  numerical

value  directly  from  the  center  and  you

can  also  use  a  percentage  value  as  well

now  if  you  want  to  use  pixels  you  can  go

ahead  and  select  pixels  but  for  this

demonstration  Ill  just  use  percentages

and  Im  just  going  to  type  in  well  first

Im  going  to  select  scale

proportionately  so  it  scales  both

dimensions  and  Im  going  to  scale  this

down  by

50%  and  I  will  click  apply  and  you  can

see  what  happens  it  scales  the  object

down  exactly  in  the  center  so  that  it

doesnt  lose  its  alignment  on  the

page  now  lets  go  over  the  rotate  tab

normally  when  you  want  to  rotate  an

object  you  can  click  on  it  to  select  it

click  on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles  and  you  can  rotate  it  around

freeh  hands  like  that  or  you  can  hold

the  control  key  and  lock  it  to  15  degree

increments  the  problem  with  using  this

approach  is  that  you  dont  get  an  exact

rotation  so  lets  say  you  wanted  to

rotate  your  object  by  a  specific

numerical  value  like  26°  or  some  kind  of

random  number  you  would  normally  have  to

click  and  drag  like  this  and  look

towards  the  bottom  of  the  screen  to  see

the  Angles  and  hope  that  you  can  release

the  click  exactly  where  you  need  it  to

be  or  you  can  just  use  the  rotation  tool

so  I  can  come  over  here  and  type  in  let

me  just  replace  this  value  type  in  26

and  you  can  choose  whether  to  rotate  it

clockwise  or  counterclockwise  and  then

click  apply  and  you  can  see  it  rotated

the  object  26°  and  the  way  the  transform

tool  works  is  this  is  all  cumulative  so

if  I  keep  clicking  apply  over  and  over

again  itll  rotate  it

26°  relative  to  its  previous  position  so

I  can  keep  rotating  this  indefinitely

like  that  and  you  get  the

idea  now  lets  go  over  how  you  can

create  that  spiraling  hexagon  design

that  I  showed  you  at  the  beginning  of

the  video  Im  going  to  grab  my  stars  and

polygons  tool  over  here  and  the  settings

I  want  to  use  are  polygon  I  want  six

corners  and  rounded  and  randomize  both

set  to  zero  and  then  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  on  the  canvas  and  then  hold

control  and  shift  and  click  and  drag  so

that  we  get  a  nice  uh  upright  hexagon

like  that  you  can  rotate  it  around  to

make  sure  that  the  corners  are  going

perfectly  up  and  down  vertically  like

that  and  Im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  and  I  first  want  to  Center  this  on

the  page  so  I  will  come  over  here  to

object  and  I  will  choose  a  line

distribute  and  Im  going  to  choose  page

from  the  relative  to  dropdown  and  Im

going  to  Center  this  up  on  the  page  and

then  Im  going  to  zoom  in  and  Im  going

to  hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  this

down  to  make  it  really  small  we  want

this  object  to  be  pretty  small  and  Im

going  to  remove  the  fill  color  by

clicking  the  Red  X  down  here  and  Im

going  to  apply  a  black  Stroke  by  holding

the  shift  key  and  pressing  the  color

black  next  to  that  uh  number  right  there

or  next  to  that  red  X  and  now  I  want  to

make  sure  that  this  stroke  is  one  pixel

so  Ill  open  open  up  my  fill  and  stroke

menu  by  double  clicking  this  stroke  box

down  here  and  Ill  come  over  here  to  the

stroke  style  Tab  and  Im  going  to  size

this  at  one  pixel  and  I  want  to  make

sure  that  the  join  has  sharp  corners  and

then  I  want  to  come  up  here  to  this

setting  in  the  toolbar  that  says  when

scaling  objects  scale  the  stroke  width

by  the  same  proportion  I  want  to  make

sure  that  that  is  enabled  and  now  what

Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  come

over  here  to  my  transform  tool  and  Im

going  to  use  two  different

Transformations  Im  first  going  to  scale

it  by  110%  and  then  Im  going  to  rotate

it  by  10°  but  before  I  do  that  I  want  to

make  a  duplicate  copy  so  this  is  the

original  copy  Im  going  to  make  a

duplicate  by  either  right  clicking  it

and  going  to  duplicate  or  just  pressing

command  D  or  controll  D  and  when  you

press  that  youll  have  a  duplicate  copy

there  and  once  you  do  that  come  over

here  to  the  scale  tab  lets  scale  this

well  first  of  all  enable  scale

proportionately  and  were  going  to  scale

this  by

110°  or  110%  and  click  apply  and  then

well  come  over  here  to  rotate  were

going  to  rotate  this  by  10°  so  let  me

replate  this  replace  this  with  10  and

there  we  go  and  now  Im  just  going  to

repeat  that  process  over  and  over  until

we  get  the  intended  effect  so  Im  going

to  press  command  D  again  to  duplicate

the  object  and  I  will  rotate  it  and  then

come  over  here  and  scale  it  and  then  I

will  do  that  again  press  control  D  to

duplicate  scale  it  and  then  rotate  it

and  then  do  the  same  thing  control  D  to

duplicate  rotate  it  scale  it  and  you  can

see  that  the  design  is  starting  to  come

together  as  I  do  this  so  Im  going  to

duplicate  this  a  bunch  of  times  and

apply  these  Transformations  and  then  I

will  catch  up  with  you  when  Im  all

done  and  you  can  make  as  many  copies  as

you  want  I  made  this  many  right  here  if

I  click  and  drag  over  all  of  these  itll

show  you  how  many  objects  you  have

selected  let  me  move  this  out  of  the  way

you  can  see  we  have  19  objects  selected

so  I  have  19  copies  in  total  what  Im

going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  convert

these  to  a  path  so  Ill  go  to  path  and

select  stroke  to  path  and  then  I  will

unify  them  together  by  going  to  path  and

selecting  Union  and  now  what  I  will  do

is  I  will  come  back  over  here  to  my  fill

and  stroke  tab  I  want  to  bring  the

opacity  down  in  half  so  I  can  see  what

Im  about  to  do  once  I  do  this  and  now  I

will  go  to  path  and  select  break  apart

and  you  can  see  what  I  mean  there  once

you  break  that  apart  you  can  see  all  of

the  different  layers  beneath  the

original  so  Ill  click  off  of  that  to

deselect  it  and  I  want  to  take  this

larger  hexagon  in  the  back  here  and  just

press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get  rid

of  that  and  then  Ill  take  this  object

in  the  center  and  press  delete  to  get

press  delete  to  get  rid  of  that  and  then

I  will  bring  the  opacity  of  this  up  to

to  100%  And  if  you  want  you  can  go  and

color  in  each  of  these  arms  a  different

color  if  you  want  to  apply  your  own

design  uh  your  own  style  to  it  or  what

you  could  do  is  you  could  just  select  it

all  and  go  to  path  and  select  Union  and

we  end  up  with  this  cool  little  abstract

sort  of  hexagon  shape  so  I  think  that

should  do  it  for  this  tutorial  thats

just  one  example  of  how  you  can  use  the

transform  tool  in  inkscape  to  create  an

interesting  design  if  you  found  this

lesson  useful  then  consider  checking  out

my  inkscape  master  class  its  a

collection  of  over  60  videos  where  I  go

over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  kind  of  like

how  I  did  in  this  video  we  even  have  a

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  want  and  best  of  all  theres  no
