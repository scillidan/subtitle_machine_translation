this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  this  eSports  logo

using  Inkscape  version  1.0  and  its

important  that  you  use  version  1.0  for

this  tutorial  because  we  will  be  using

the  new  offset  live  path  effect  quite  a

bit  in  this  lesson  and  its  also

important  that  you  download  and  install

a  particular  font  known  as  Falcons  I

will  have  that  linked  in  the  description

of  the  video  it  is  a  free  font  so  go

ahead  and  download  and  install  that  font

before  you  launch  Inkscape  and  youll  be

good  to  go  and  before  we  get  started  if

you  would  like  to  learn  more  about

Inkscape  be  sure  to  check  out  my

Inkscape  masterclass  its  a  collection

of  over  60  videos  where  I  go  over  every

single  tool  and  feature  in  Inkscape  and

I  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate  how

it  works  Ill  put  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  so  well  get  started  here

in  Inkscape  the  first  thing  we  want  to

do  is  setup  our  documents  that  were  all

working  with  this  similar  layout  the

first  thing  I  want  to  do  is  come  up  here

and  click  this  button  to  disable

snapping  I  want  this  all  disabled  for

the  time  being  well  be  enabling  it

throughout  the  tutorial  but  for  now  we

want  that  turned  off  were  gonna  come  up

here  to  where  it  says  view  view  were

gonna  want  custom  selected  and  Im  going

to  go  to  zoom  Im  going  to  zoom  in  at  1

to  1  and  for  now  were  gonna  want  the

alignment  distribute  menu  opened  were

gonna  want  last  selected  chosen  from

that  drop-down  then  we  want  the  fill  and

Stroke  menu  open  which  is  this  button

over  here  or  you  could  press  control

shift  +  F  and  let  me  just  expand  that  so

that  I  have  both  of  these  open  at  the

same  time  I  just  want  to  change  the  way

that  those  menus  are  Docs  there  we  go

and  were  gonna  use  the  path  effects

menu  too  but  Ill  get  to  that  a  little

later  so  what  we  want  to  do  now  is

basically  what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna

break  this  up  into  three  different  parts

and  Ill  have  them  time  stamped  down

below  because  this  is  this  is  somewhat

of  an  elaborate  design  so  its  gonna

take  us  a  while  to  create  this  and  the

first  part  will  create  the  text  the

second  part  will  create  the  emblem  and

then  in  the  third  part  will  create  the

controller  so  lets  start  off  with  the

text  Im  gonna  grab  the  text  tool  and

Im  gonna  click  on  the  canvas  here  and

Im  gonna  use  all  caps  for  this  tutorial

Im  going  to  use  the  word  eSports  for

example  grab  the  grab  the  text  tool

Im  going  to  change  that  grab  the  text

editor  up  here  Im  gonna  change  this  to

Falcons  there  we  go  thats  the  font

were  looking  for  let  me  grab  the  Select

tool  and  hold  ctrl  and  shift  to  scale

this  up  what  we  want  to  do  now  is

manually  adjust  the  spacing  between

these  letters  and  I  also  want  to  change

the  way  that  these  letters  interact  with

each  other  let  me  show  you  what  I  mean

here  on  the  thumbnail  if  you  see  here

between  these  letters  youll  see  I  have

the  letters  kind  of  look  like  they  fit

next  to  each  other  like  puzzle  pieces  I

want  to  make  it  so  that  each  letter  is

slicing  off  the  top  right  edge  of  the

letter  that  comes  before  it  so  to  do

that  let  me  get  this  off  the  screen  to

do  that  Im  going  to  convert  the  text  of

paths  path  object  to  path  and  then  Ill

ungroup  the  letters  like  that  and  let  me

just  bring  the  opacity  of  that  down  so  I

can  see  through  them  a  little  bit  and

Im  gonna  zoom  in  to  zoom  in  Im  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel  to

move  the  page  around  Im  just  pressing

down  the  mouse  wheel  and  moving  the

mouse  Im  gonna  click  this  letter

hold  ctrl  click  and  drag  it  to  the  right

like  that  so  that  its  not  quite

touching  the  s  but  pretty  close  hold

shift  click  the  other  letter  bring  these

two  over  here  like  that  do  the  same

thing  and  thats  going  to  come  through

here  and  do  the  same  thing  with  the  rest

of  this  world  with  the  rest  of  this  word

holding  shift  while  we  click  on  each

letter  so  it  drags  the  whole  word  over

there  this  isnt  necessarily  a  step  that

you  have  to  do  but  I  just  think  the

design  will  look  a  lot  better  if  you  go

ahead  and  make  these  letters  look  like

they  fit  together  so  what  Im  gonna  do

now  is  Im  gonna  duplicate  this  letter  S

right  here  by  pressing  ctrl  D  Im  gonna

make  that  red  and  then  Ill  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  letter  E  and  go  to  path

difference  and  if  you  notice  now  if  you

move  this  apart  it  looks  like  those  two

letters  fit  with  each  other  so  let  me

put  that  back  Im  gonna  come  through

here  and  do  the  same  thing  with  the  rest

of  these  letters  duplicate  that  hold

shift  click  the  letter  go  to  path

difference  take  the  letter  O  ctrl  D  hold

shift  click  the  P

path  difference  and  Im  sure  you  get  the

idea  by  now  so  so  let  me  go  through  and

do  this  with  the  rest  of  the  word  here

difference  Im  actually  gonna  use  the

keyboard  shortcut  for  this  last  one

because  I  havent  memorized  I  actually

never  used  these  menus  up  here  I  always

use  the  keyboard  shortcut  which  for  this

one  is  ctrl  shift  and  -  okay  so  let  me

take  the  letter  S  and  hold  ctrl  and  move

that  to  the  right  a  little  bit  hold

shift  click  the  T  move  that  to  the  right

a  little  bit  while  holding  ctrl  so  that

were  locking  it  onto  the  horizontal

axis  same  thing  over  here  with  the  R

were  basically  we  just  spacing  these

letters  out  apart  like  that  looking  good

do  the  same  thing  over  here  now  let  me

zoom  back  out  to  see  how  were  looking

over  here  okay  thats  looking  pretty

good  right  there  so  what  Im  gonna  do  is

Im  gonna  unify  all  those  letters

together  by  selecting  them  all  and  going

to  path  Union  and  now  what  I  want  to  do

is  I  want  to  a  plot  I  want  to  apply  a

perspective  like  you  see  here  so  let  me

go  to  path  path  effects  and  youre  gonna

get  this  path  effects  editor  up  here  Im

gonna  click  the  add  path  effect  button

and  Im  going  to  look  for  perspective

there  it  is  perspective  envelope  and  I

want  to  check  this  box  that  says  mere

movements  in  vertical  and  then  grab  the

edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  and  what  were

looking  for  here  were  looking  for  the

nodes  in  the  corner  but  they  look

different  they  look  similar  to  the  other

nodes  but  the  look  the  node  that  were

looking  for  is  white  these  ones  are  gray

so  they  look  similar  so  its  easy  to

miss  them  make  sure  youre  grabbing  the

white  node  like  that  Im  just  going  to

take  that  and  pull  that  out  if  you  want

you  could  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it  onto  the

axis  pull  that  out  a  little  bit  like

that  just  to  give  it  a  little  bit  of  a

perspective  and  now  we  can  finalize  that

by  going  to  path  object  to  path  now  what

Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  give  this  a

bit  of  a  3d  effect  as  you  can  see  here

if  you  notice  is  a  bit  of  a  like  a  3d

effect  like  its  coming  out  at  you  like

that

were  gonna  use  the  extrude  feature  for

that  so  let  me  grab  this  select  tool  let

me  just  adjust  that  a  little  bit  make

that  a  little  higher  that  looks  pretty

good  I  want  to  right  click  this  text  and

go  to  duplicate  I  want  to  make  this  red

and  I  want  to  hold  ctrl  and  move  this  up

above  it  a  little  bit  Im  gonna  hold

ctrl  scale  this  up  a  little  bit  maybe

about  that  much  it  doesnt  have  to  be

exactly  the  the  amount  that  Im  scaling

it  you  can  just  eyeball  it  like

doing  here  and  then  I  want  to  select

both  of  these  actually  let  me  move  this

up  a  little  bit  let  me  select  both  of

these  and  go  to  extensions  generate  from

path  and  Im  gonna  look  for  extrude  and

right  here  I  want  to  choose  polygons  and

then  click  apply  and  its  gonna  create

this  3d  block  right  here  so  let  me  get

rid  of  this  let  me  take  this  new  shape

that  I  created  let  me  ungroup  that  the

only  unified  altogether  by  going  to  path

Union  and  I  want  to  get  rid  of  those

empty  negative  spaces  in  there  so  Ill

go  to  path  break  apart  and  then  path

Union  let  me  get  rid  of  the  stroke  or

the  outline  Im  gonna  hold  shift  and

click  on  this  X  up  here  and  let  me  come

over  here  to  the  fill  tab  under  the  HSL

tab  Im  just  gonna  make  sure  that  a

column  is  brought  all  the  way  up  and

then  Ill  bring  the  opacity  down

partially  like  that  and  now  I  can  take

this  red  text  up  here  our  original  text

make  sure  its  raised  to  the  top  Im

gonna  click  this  button  raise  selection

to  the  top  select  both  of  these  and

Center  them  up  and  they  come  down  here

to  the  alignment  menu  Center  them  up  on

the  vertical  axis  and  then  align  the  top

edges  like  that  so  that  we  end  up  with

that  right  there  now  we  could  take  this

and  we  can  just  press  delete  to  get  rid

of  that  we  dont  need  that  right  now  so

now  what  I  want  to  do  is  I  want  to  take

this  red  text  this  original  text  layer

and  I  want  to  make  this  white  and  then  I

want  to  take  the  black  text  beneath  it

and  I  want  to  apply  an  offset  to  it  so

Im  gonna  come  back  up  here  to  the  path

effects  menu  click  the  plus  button  to

add  a  path  effect  and  on  this  time  Im

looking  for  offset  and  I  would  recommend

getting  familiar  getting  comfortable

with  this  path  effect  because  well  be

using  this  a  lot  throughout  this

tutorial  where  it  says  offset  Im  gonna

click  the  plus  button  to  increase  the

offset  and  if  you  notice  its  growing  a

border  around  the  text  right  there  by

default  it  should  have  lighter  if  not

just  go  ahead  and  select  that

there  we  go  thats  looking  pretty  good

now  let  me  finalize  that  by  going  to

path  object  to  path  and  now  what  I  want

to  do  is  I  want  to  create  another  copy

of  this  text  here  let  me  show  you  where

Im  where  Im  going  with  this  notice

this  little  reflective  effect  going

through  the  text  there  thats  what  Im

gonna  create  next  so  let  me  take  this

white  text  let  me  duplicate  that  by

Crescent  control-d  and  Ill  just  make

this  red  so  I  can  differentiate  it  up

against  the  white  and  Im  going  to  apply

an  offset  to  this  as  well  so  click  on

the  offset  path  effect  and  where  it  says

offset  Im  just  going  to  press  -  this

time  Im  going  to  click  that  down  maybe

not  that  much  right  about  there  is  what

were  going  for

again  well  finalize  that  by  going  to

path  object  to  path  and  now  Im  going  to

grab  the  rectangle  tool  I  want  to  slice

this  in  half  here  so  Im  gonna  use  the

rectangle  tool  as  a  reference  point  put

that  through  there  like  that  let  me  just

make  this  green  so  I  can  see  a  little

better  okay  that  looks  pretty  good  let

me  go  to  the  Select  tool  and  let  me

adjust  that  just  a  little  more  hold

shift  click  on  the  rip  on  the  red  text

that  we  have  the  green  box  and  the  red

text  selected  and  go  to  path

intersection  so  what  Im  going  to  do  now

is  Im  going  to  color  this  in  so  let  me

select  all  of  this  and  bring  the  opacity

all  the  way  up  to  100%  and  Im  going  to

use  the  colors  depicted  here  in  the

thumbnail  or  something  very  close  anyway

Im  probably  not  going  to  get  the  exact

shades  but  Ill  take  the  other  black

background  here  and  Im  going  to  make

this  a  very  dark  shade  of  purple  like

that  then  Ill  take  the  white  text  in

here  Ill  make  that  a  light  shade  of

purple  maybe  something  with  a  little

more  vibrance  that  looks  good  maybe

adjust  that  a  little  bit  and  then  I  want

to  make  this  an  even  lighter  shade  of

purple  so  let  me  make  this  something

like  that  down  here  I  actually  know  this

has  to  be  a  medium  shade  of  purple  my

bad  okay  so  well  do  that  okay  now  were

going  to  apply  to  a  gradient  to  this  so

where  it  says  up  here  in  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  were  looking  for  a  linear

gradient  click  on  that  grab  the  gradient

tool  which  is  right  here  I  just  like  to

press  G  on  the  keyboard  and  then  take

the  darker  stop  and  put  this  towards  the

top  and  then  take  the  lighter  one  and

put  this  towards  the  bottom  and  Im

gonna  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it  onto  the

vertical  axis  so  that  we  end  up  with

something  like  that  right  there  now  let

me  go  back  to  the  Select  tool  I  want  to

take  this  text  Im  just  gonna  make  this

a  little  lighter  Im  just  eyeballing

this  here  I  dont

like  how  that  looks  before  so  thats

looking  pretty  good  right  there  so

thats  part  one  we  have  the  text

finished  let  me  click  and  drag  over  all

of  this  I  want  to  group  it  together  and

press  ctrl  G  on  the  keyboard  Im  going

to  put  this  off  to  the  side  for  now

maybe  Ill  even  scale  it  down  like  that

hold  ctrl  and  scale  it  down  and  now

were  going  to  create  the  emblem  so  let

me  grab  the  actually  first  let  me  show

you  the  thumbnail  here  Im  gonna  create

this  emblem  that  you  see  in  the

background  to  create  that  shape  Im

actually  going  to  start  off  with  this

square  so  let  me  show  you  how  that  works

Im  going  to  grab  this  squares  and

rectangles  tool  Im  gonna  hold  ctrl  +

Shift  +  click  and  drag  on  the  cabbage  to

create  a  perfectly  symmetrical  square

like  that  I  just  want  to  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  make  Carter  corner  sharp

make  sure  thats  enabled  if  you  cant

click  it  and  its  grayed  out  that  means

youre  good  to  go

we  dont  want  rounded  corners  for  were

about  to  do  here  so  its  important  to

check  that  and  let  me  convert  that  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  object  to  path  and

Ill  go  to  the  nodes  tool  and  I  want  to

add  some  new  nodes  in  here  I  want  to  add

one  right  here  and  add  one  right  there

so  let  me  select  those  nodes  click  this

button  up  here  to  the  top  left  that  says

insert  new  nodes  into  selected  segments

and  then  come  down  here  do  the  same

thing  and  then  I  want  to  select  these

two  nodes  right  here  the  two  new  ones

and  up  here  where  it  says  show

transformation  handles  for  selected

nodes  lets  go  ahead  and  turn  that  on  so

we  can  see  the  transformation  because  we

want  to  do  is  we  want  to  hold  ctrl  down

and  just  hold  ctrl  and  shift  actually

and  just  scale  them  out  like  that  pull

them  out  about  that  far  thats  looking

pretty  good

and  now  I  want  to  take  these  bottom  ones

down  here  and  hold  ctrl  and  just  scale

those  down  actually  let  me  hold  ctrl  and

shift  then  Ill  hold  ctrl  and  move  this

up  like  that  that  right  there  is  what

were  looking  for  thats  sort  of  its

kind  of  like  a  squared  shield  kind  of

shape  now  once  youre  done  making  that

shape  you  can  go  ahead  and  disable  this

transformation  handle  because  the  next

time  you  go  to  Newton  use  the  nodes  tool

that  will  get  in  your  way  if  you  dont

need  it  so  I  like  to  always  turn  that

off  when  Im  done  now  let  me  take  this

and  scale  this  up  a  little  bit  let  me

take  the  text  actually  and  Im  gonna

raise  this  to  the  top  and  place  it  over

the  emblem  here  let  me  Center  them  up  on

the  vertical

horizontal-axis  like  that  Im  gonna  take

just  the  text  and  hold  ctrl  and  shift

and  scale  this  up  like  that  and  I  want

to  take  the  shield  right  here  and  I  want

to  make  it  the  same  color  as  this  dark

purple  down  here  so  Im  gonna  grab  the

dropper  which  is  over  here  we  can  just

press  D  on  the  keyboard  there  you  go  and

now  I  want  to  create  these  little  accent

pieces  going  on  the  inside  of  that

shield  shape  so  to  do  that  Im  going  to

create  a  duplicate  of  this  object  Im

going  to  right  click  and  go  to  duplicate

and  Im  going  to  make  this  the  lighter

shade  of  purple  so  let  me  grab  the

dropper  again  press  D  on  the  keyboard

and  use  this  lighter  shade  as  a

reference  there  we  go  back  to  the  Select

tool  and  now  I  want  to  do  another  offset

so  let  me  add  a  new  path  effect  were

gonna  use  offset  again  and  Im  going  to

use  the  -  Im  going  to  shrink  this  down

like  that  and  what  Im  paying  attention

to  here  is  I  want  to  make  sure  that  the

thickness  here  this  the  padding  between

the  dark  and  the  light  here  is  pretty

much  the  same  or  close  anyway  to  the

thickness  of  the  wording  here  I  want  the

I  want  the  padding  to  be  consistent

between  the  shield  and  the  text  so  you

may  have  to  tweak  that  manually  Im  not

using  exact  measurements  or  anything  Im

just  going  by  how  it  looks  on  my  screen

thats  good  enough  so  let  me  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  now  what  Ill  do  is

Ill  create  a  duplicate  of  this

right-click  it  go  to  duplicate  and  Im

just  gonna  make  this  a  different  color

for  now  maybe  red  bring  the  opacity  down

it  doesnt  matter  what  color  it  is  let

me  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  this

down  to  make  it  smaller  and  then  Ill  go

back  to  the  nodes  tool  up  here  select

these  two  nodes  right  here  and  then  turn

the  transformation  handles  back  on  and

then  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  these

nodes  up  like  that  so  that  they  surpass

so  that  they  extend  beyond  the  the  white

via  the  lighter  purple  shape  there  which

is  what  were  going  for

let  me  turn  those  off  go  back  to  the

Select  tool  hold  shift  click  on  the

other  shape  so  we  have  them  both

selected  and  go  to  path  difference  and

now  we  want  them  to  be  two  different

colors  so  Im  going  to  go  to  path  break

apart  to  break  them  apart  and

separate  pieces  paths  break  apart  and

let  me  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  Im  gonna  take  this  one  right

here  and  make  this  the  medium  shade  of

purple  which  is  right  here  so  let  me

grab  the  dropper  again  just  press  D  on

the  keyboard  and  just  click  on  that  and

there  to  give  that  that  same  color  maybe

a  little  lighter  there  we  go

Ill  grab  the  select  tool  take  this  text

item  raise  it  to  the  top  once  again  and

as  you  can  see  we  are  on  our  way  we  just

have  to  now  create  the  controller

illustration  so  let  me  bring  that  in

here  as  you  can  see  now  now  were  going

to  create  the  controller  the  shape  of

this  controller  is  a  very  unique  shape

theres  no  tool  that  makes  that  specific

shape  and  Inkscape  so  were  gonna

manually  create  it  using  ellipses  so  let

me  move  that  off  the  screen  we  can  do

now  is  you  can  take  this  and  just  hold

ctrl  and  shift  to  scale  that  down  put  it

off  to  the  side  for  now  may  be  a  good

idea  to  save  your  work  at  this  point  in

case  Inkscape  crashes  you  dont  want  to

lose  all  of  this  that  youve  been

working  on  so  Im  actually  gonna  do  that

real  quick  myself  okay  so  now  that  Ive

saved  my  work  lets  create  the

controller  now  so  Im  gonna  grab  the

circles  and  ellipses  tool  Im  gonna

click  and  drag  to  create  an  ellipse  like

that  and  while  Im  creating  this  shape

Im  just  gonna  for  now  make  this  black

and  Im  gonna  make  sure  the  opacity  is

down  in  half  like  that  because  were

gonna  be  able  to  see  through  these

shapes  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  object  to  path  and

then  Im  gonna  grab  the  edit  pads  by

nodes  tool  and  I  want  to  take  these  two

nodes  up  here  and  hold  ctrl  and  just

scale  them  up  like  that  not  too  much

maybe  up  about  that  much  and  then  Ill

take  this  node  and  hold  ctrl  and  scale

that  down  a  little  bit  now  let  me  grab

this  select  tool  Im  gonna  make  this  a

little  wider  again  Im  just  eyeballing

us  it  doesnt  have  to  be  exactly  like

what  you  see  on  my  screen  just  something

there  abouts  is  pretty  good  Im  gonna

click  on  this  so  I  get  the  rotation

handles  Im  gonna  hold  ctrl  to  take  this

little  hand  on  the  top  right  corner  and

Im  gonna  rotate  this  clockwise  one  to

two  steps  like  that

now  let  me  duplicate  that  by  pressing

ctrl  D  I  want  to  flip  this  horizontally

and  hold  ctrl  and  move  this  over  here

like  that  and  now  I  want  to  grab  the

ellipses  tool  again  and  I  want  to  create

another  ellipse

going  through  the  inside  here  like  this

make  sure  that  this  is  oops  make  sure

this  is  going  through  to  the  other  side

like  that  thats  looking  pretty  good  now

I  just  want  to  make  sure  that  these

three  shapes  are  spaced  apart  evenly

otherwise  youll  get  a  little  bit  of

asymmetry  here  so  let  me  select  all

three  of  those  and  down  here  in  the

align  and  distribute  menu  and  under  the

distribute  panel  you  should  see

something  that  says  make  horizontal  gaps

between  objects  equal  go  ahead  and  click

on  that  and  now  we  can  unify  this

together  by  going  to  path  Union  and  we

have  the  beginning  of  a  controller  shape

but  if  you  notice  its  not  quite  there

yet  if  you  notice  on  the  thumbnail  here

the  controller  shape  dips  down  like  that

and  then  it  dips  upward  like  that  so  to

do  that  were  gonna  have  to  manually

create  that  shape  so  let  me  grab  the

Edit  path  by  nodes  tool  again  and  Im

gonna  take  this  note  up  here  Im  gonna

click  and  drag  this  down  actually

theres  two  nodes  theres  one  cigar  grab

both  of  those  let  me  undo  that  with  ctrl

Z  if  you  end  up  having  two  nodes  there

like  I  do  just  click  and  drag  over  both

of  those  and  combine  them  together  join

selected  nodes  there  we  go  and  then  hold

ctrl  and  just  click  and  drag  them  down

like  that  and  then  just  take  this  handle

and  make  it  adjust  it  so  that  its  this

line  right  here  is  going  flush  with  the

rest  of  it  dont  worry  about  this  side

were  actually  gonna  exclude  this  side

and  duplicate  this  left  side  lets  take

this  one  and  do  the  same  thing  move  this

up  here  like  that  adjust  this  handle

there  we  go  now  what  I  want  to  do  is

hold  ctrl  and  click  on  that  node  so  that

it  makes  it  automatically  smooth  I  want

to  do  the  same  thing  up  here  hold  ctrl

click  on  this  node  Im  actually  gonna

bring  this  up  a  little  more  there  we  go

now  what  I  want  to  do  is  I  want  to

temporarily  turn  on  snapping  where  it

says  enable  snapping  turn  that  on  and

over  here  where  it  says  were  gonna  want

this  one  that  says  snap  to  custom  nodes

and  then  this  one  that  says  snap  to

smooth  nodes  and  Im  gonna  grab  the

Bezier  pen  over  here  or  you  could  press

B  on  the  keyboard  Im  gonna  snap  to  that

middle  node  that  we  just  created  and

click  and  then  bring  the  line  straight

down  to  the  other  node  click  on  that  and

then  finish  this  shape  up  going  around

the  outside  of  the  controller  here  and

that

the  starting  point  now  I  want  to  grab

this  select  tool  hold  shift  click  on  the

controller  and  go  to  path  difference  and

now  we  have  half  of  a  controller  so  what

Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

duplicate  that  right  click  go  to

duplicate  flip  it  horizontally  and  then

snap  it  on  to  the  left  side  over  here  so

that  we  end  up  with  this  symmetrical

shape  now  let  me  turn  off  the  snapping

now  so  that  it  doesnt  get  in  the  way

for  the  rest  of  the  way  and  I  want  to

click  and  drag  over  both  of  those  and  go

to  path  Union  and  we  now  have  our

controller  shape  so  now  its  time  to  add

some  buttons  and  some  some  simulated

lighting  effects  in  here  a  little  bit  of

shading  and  some  buttons  so  to  do  that

lets  first  add  these  buttons  down  here

grab  the  circles  and  ellipses  tool  hold

ctrl  and  shift  create  a  perfectly  round

circle  put  that  right  there  and  then  I

want  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing  ctrl

D  instead  of  right-clicking  and  going  to

duplicate  were  just  going  to  press  ctrl

D  just  easier  to  do  that  make  this  red

just  for  now  hold  ctrl  ctrl  and  shift

scale  that  down  and  now  I  want  to  take

both  of  those  and  group  them  together

and  I  want  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing

ctrl  D  again  hold  ctrl  and  click  and

drag  these  over  here  so  that  we  have  a

copy  over  here  and  again  we  want  to  make

sure  that  this  is  centered  up  on  the

controller  so  lets  group  those  together

with  that  group  button  up  there  hold

shift  click  on  the  controller  and  then

again  just  make  sure  theyre  centered  up

on  the  vertical  axis  like  that  I  might

even  make  these  a  little  bigger  bring

them  down  a  little  more  okay  that  looks

pretty  good

now  Im  gonna  ungroup  those  actually  no

there  we  go  this  is  the  ungroup  button

just  youll  have  to  click  it  a  few  times

because  its  grouped  several  layers  deep

so  well  have  to  do  like  a  deep  ungroup

on  that  what  we  can  do  now  is  lets

create  the  D  pad  over  here  and  the

buttons  over  here  so  let  me  grab  the

squares  and  rectangles  tool  zoom  back  in

just  create  a  very  simple  very  simple

rectangle  like  that  let  me  zoom  in  Im

gonna  use  this  little  rounded  node  at

the  top  right  to  make  this  to  make  the

edges  of  that  rounded  and  then  Ill  take

this  note  up  here  and  bring  that  in  life

like  that  so  that  we  end  up  with

slightly  rounded  rectangle  a  slightly

rounded  rectangle  like  that  right  click

that  go  to  duplicate  and  then  were  just

gonna  rotate  that  90  degrees  with  this

button  that  says  rotate  selection  90

degrees  clockwise  there  we  go  I  actually

dont  like  how  that  button  how  this  came

out  so  emotionally  to  delete  that  Im

going  to  grab  the  nodes  tool  this  is  a

little  too  elongated  so  Im  going  to

convert  this  to  a  path  path  object  to

path  this  is  all  optional  you  dont  have

to  do  it  what  im  doing  here  im  just

being  meticulous  at  this  point  im  gonna

take  those  nodes  bring  them  up  a  little

bit  with  the  arrow  keys  and  ill  do  the

same  thing  again  control  d  rotate  it  90

degrees  and  that  looks  a  little  better

ill  just  go  with  that  select  both  of

them  go  to  path  Union  now  let  me  just

scale  that  down  a  little  bit  put  that

right  here  now  I  want  to  put  a  little

circle  behind  this  but  behind  this  as

well  if  I  bring  this  back  in  youll

notice  theres  a  circle  behind  the  d-pad

and  a  circle  behind  the  button  so  let  me

create  a  circle  control  and  shift  to

make  a  perfectly  round  circle  Im  going

to  make  this  its  gonna  make  this  green

for  now  layer  this  beneath  the  d-pad

with  the  button  up  here  that  says  lower

selection  one  step  hold  shift  click  on

that  and  just  make  sure  to  Center  it  up

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis  like

that  Ill  move  this  up  here  Im  gonna

make  this  a  little  bigger  then  Ill  take

this  green  circle  duplicate  that  by

pressing  control  D  and  hold  ctrl  to  move

this  over  here  and  now  we  can  create

some  buttons  so  let  me  create  more

circles  over  here  ctrl  and  shift  Ill

make  that  red  I  just  want  to  Center  this

up  make  sure  its  centered  within  the

circle  there  take  this  circle  control  D

to  duplicate  it  bring  this  one  down  here

shift-click  both  of  them  and  then  group

them  together  ctrl  D  to  duplicate  click

on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation  handles

and  then  hold  ctrl  and  rotate  this

counter  or  clockwise  rather  until  you

end  up  with  buttons  going  in  all  four

directions  like  that  and  thats  what

were  looking  for  so  let  me  hold  shift

and  click  on  both  of  those  I  want  to

group  them  together

shift-click  on  the  circle  and  center

that  up  within  the  circle  and  the

vertical  and  horizontal  axis  and  what

Im  gonna  do  now  is  now  that  we  have  our

buttons  in  place  I  want  to  add  I  want  to

add  some  more  details  in  here  so  first

let  me  just  click  and  drag  over  all  of

this  and  do  a  deep  on  a  group  let  me

just  make  sure  everything  is  ungrouped

here  and  now  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  lets  click  and  drag  over

everything  lets  bring  the  opacity  all

the  way  up  like  that  lets  take  the

controller  and  make  this  the  medium

shade  of  purple  which  is  over  here  grab

press  D  on  the  keyboard  to  grab  the

dropper  there  we  go  go  back  to  the

Select  tool  I  want  to  make  this  I  want

to  make  these  black  circles  the  same

shade  as  well  so  Im  gonna  press  D  to

get  the  dropper  back  to  the  Select  tool

D  for  the  dropper  there  we  go  and  now  I

want  to  go  back  to  the  Select  tool  I

want  to  take  this  D  pad  these  joysticks

over  here  and  these  buttons  and  make

them  the  same  shade  as  a  dark  purple

here  so  let  me  shift  click  all  of  that

Im  gonna  make  sure  I  have  all  of  that

selected  and  then  Ill  come  over  here

and  again  D  for  the  dropper  and  make

this  the  dark  shade  of  purple  like  that

thats  what  Im  going  for  it

and  now  back  to  the  select  tool  lets

take  this  green  shape  hold  shift  grab

this  green  shape  hold  shift  grab  this

circle  down  here  and  then  this  circle

down  here  as  well  and  make  this  the

light  shade  of  purple  so  once  again

press  D  on  the  keyboard  to  grab  the

dropper  there  we  go  and  now  we  have  that

colored  in  the  final  part  of  the

controller  here  is  to  add  these  little

these  little  shading  these  little  this

little  shading  effect  here  so  let  me

take  this  controller  object  right  here

I  want  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing

control  D  I  want  to  make  this  green  or

whatever  color  you  want  just  some  kind

of  contrasting  color  I  want  to  bring  the

opacity  down  like  that  and  once  again

were  going  to  use  the  offset  path

effect  so  Im  going  to  add  a  new  path

effect  right  back  to  offset  over  here

and  where  it  says  offset  Im  just  gonna

use  this  minus  symbol  make  this  a  little

smaller  like  that

thats  what  were  looking  for  now  let  me

finalise  that  I  actually  make  it  a

little  smaller

now  let  me  finalise  that  by  going  to

path  object  to  path  and  then  let  me

duplicate  this  by  pressing  ctrl  D  and

Ill  make  this  red  and  Im  just  going  to

move  this  up  up  like  this  Im  gonna  hold

ctrl  and  just  scale  that  up  a  little  bit

when  Im  paying  attention  to  here  is  the

little  piece  thats  extending  from

little  green  piece  thats  extending  from

underneath  the  red  object  here  thats

gonna  make  up  the  lighting  effect  so  Im

gonna  go  with  Im  gonna  go  with  the

positioning  like  that  hold  shift  click

on  the  green  object  and  go  to  path

difference  so  now  I  just  want  to  keep

this  object  here  I  want  to  get  rid  of

this  so  let  me  break  them  apart  by  going

to  path  break  apart  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything  and  just  take  this

and  get  rid  of  it  Im  gonna  take  this

object  bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up

and  make  this  the  same  color  that  this

is  right  here  so  once  again  were

grabbing  the  dropper  tool  press  D  on  the

keyboard  make  that  the  same  color  and

now  I  could  just  duplicate  this  object

ctrl  D  flip  it  horizontally  and  then

just  place  it  over  here  on  the  other

side  like  that  and  then  finally  Im

gonna  put  one  more  piece  right  here  so

let  me  duplicate  this  object  again  make

this  green  bring  the  opacity  down  and

come  back  over  here  to  the  path  effects

menu  and  add  another  offset  bring  this

down  right  about  there  roughly  the  same

as  we  did  before  finalize  that  by  going

to  path  object  to  path  and  then  I  want

to  duplicate  this  control  D  turn  this

red  and  then  Im  just  gonna  take  this

bottom  arrow  and  click  and  drag  that

down  like  this  and  Im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  bring  this  up  here  like  that

and  again  when  Im  paying  attention  to

is  right  here  this  little  green  part

thats  its  excluded  from  the  rest  of  it

Im  gonna  hold  shift  click  on  the  green

object  so  we  havent  both  selected  and

go  to  path  difference  and  then  we  can  go

to  path  break  apart  hold  shift  and  click

on  this  little  piece  right  here  to

deselect  it  though  we  only  have  these

two  pieces  selected  then  I  could  press

Delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get  rid  of

them

and  now  I  want  to  take  this  object  bring

the  opacity  up  and  once  again  were

grabbing  the  dropper  and  making  that  the

same  shade  so  okay  so  now  the  controller

is  finished  we  have  all  of  our

individual  objects  finished  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  over  everything  over  the

controller  rather  group  it  together

lets  bring  it  over  here  Im  gonna  hold

ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  it  down  its

time  to  put  everything  together  now  the

place  thats  right  over  here  Im  sizing

it  up  so  that  it  fits  within  here  nicely

but  then  the  top  parts  of  the  controller

are  expanding  beyond  the  emblem  theyre

just  a  little  bit  not  by  much  but  just  a

little  bit  and  one  thing  out  one  more

thing  I  want  to  do  for  the  controller

here  if  you  notice  I  have  a  little  bit

of  a  I  have  some  padding  going  around

the  controller  so  I  want  to  do  that  as

well  I  want  to  add  some  padding  around

there  first  let  me  Center  it  up  with  the

idiot  with  the  emblem  here  Im  gonna

hold  shift  and  click  on  the  emblem  and

just  make  sure  its  centered  up  on  the

vertical  axis  like  that  now  I  can  click

on  the  controller  lets  ungroup  it  click

off  at  the  deselect  lets  take  the

controller  shape  right  here  duplicate

that  by  pressing  ctrl  D  I  want  to  make

this  the  same  shade  as  the  dark  purple

here  let  me  just  grab  the  dropper  tool

by  pressing  D  make  that  the  same  color

back  to  the  select  tool  and  now  Im  just

going  to  lower  this  until  it  goes

beneath  the  controller  there  so  Im

gonna  lower  it  one  step  at  a  time  until

it  goes  beneath  the  controller  there  we

go  and  then  well  add  an  offset  and  path

effect  offset  and  Im  going  to  increase

this  offset  and  again  what  Im  paying

attention  to  here  is  the  thickness  of

this  padding  making  sure  its  consistent

with  the  thickness  of  this  padding  and

this  padding  over  here  we  want

everything  to  look  nice  and  consistent

like  it  all  belongs  together  nice  fluid

looking  there  we  go

now  let  me  go  to  path  object  to  path  to

finalize  that  and  let  me  just  take  all

of  this  right  here  the  whole  controller

with  the  padding  and  just  group  it  all

together

there  we  go  Im  just  gonna  scale  it  down

a  little  bit  we  just  double-check  make

sure  I  have  it  centered  there  we  go

so  we  have  the  design  finished  for  the

most  part  Im  actually  gonna  make  the

text  a  little  larger  there  we  go

you  may  have  to  adjust  the  sizing  based

on  how  your  design  came  out  Im  just

gonna  manually  tweak  this  a  little  bit

the  final  part  now  would  be  to  add  this

yellow  outline  going  around  the  entire

design  just  to  tie  everything  together

so  to  do  that  lets  take  everything

lets  press  control  D  on  the  keyboard  to

duplicate  everything  and  lets  do  a  deep

on  group  click  the  ungroup  button  a  few

times  to  make  sure  its  all  ungrouped

and  go  to  path  Union  and  now  Im  gonna

make  this  yellow  because  it  contrasts

nicely  with  the  purple  there  and  I  want

to  send  this  to  the  bottom  where  it  says

lower  selection  to  the  bottom  and  then

finally  one  last  time  we  will  add  an

offset  path  effect  so  but  by  this  point

Im  sure  youre  pretty  familiar  with

this  path  effect  were  just  gonna  add

this  in  manually  like  that  that  right

there  looks  pretty  good  now  we  can  just

finalize  this  by  going  to  path  object  to

path  and  there  you  go  we  are  finished

with  this  tutorial  there  you  have  your

eSports  logo  design  made  with  Inkscape
