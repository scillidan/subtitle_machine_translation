this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this  long  shadow  text

effect  with  an  aged  texture  applied  to

it  using  inkscape

before  we  get  started  though  if  youd

like  to  learn  everything  that  there  is

to  know  about  inkscape  be  sure  to  check

out  my  inkscape  master  class  its  a

collection  of  over  60  videos  where  i  go

over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  i  explained  what  they  are

and  demonstrate  how  they  work  we  even

have  a  private  community  where  you  can

ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  so  getting  us  started

here  in  inkscape  lets  first  set  up  the

document  for  our  workflow  here  so  im

going  to  come  up  here  to  the  top  left

corner  and  where  it  says  toggle  snapping

im  just  going  to  make  sure  that  is

disabled  for  now  ill  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  view  make  sure  i  have

custom  selected  and  then  come  up  here  to

zoom  and  zoom  in  at  one  to  one  like  that

now  if  you  notice  we  have  this  page

border  on  the  screen  here  im  just  going

to  press  down  the  mouse  wheel  and  move

the  mouse  to  the  right  just  to  get  that

page  butter  off  of  the  viewfinder  for

now  were  going  to  work  out  here  in  open

space  and  then  when  were  done  were

going  to  change  the  page  border  to  fit

the  design

so  once  youve  done  that  lets  grab  the

text  tool  now  and  create  some  text  im

going  to  click  on  the  canvas  to  get  the

blinking  cursor  and  im  going  to  use  the

letters  ink  for  this  demonstration

and  i  want  to  select  all  those  letters

by  pressing  ctrl  a  and  change  the  font

up  here  in  the  font  drop  down  menu

now  the  font  im  using  is  over  here

called  varsity  team  for  this  sort  of

design  i  would  recommend  using  this  font

right  here  because  of  the  style  of  the

font  it  makes  it  easier  to  work  with  i

will  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  to  where  you  can  download  and

install  that  font  so  make  sure  to  go

ahead  and  install  that  font  before

getting  started

and  once  ive  done  that  im  going  to

grab  the  select  tool  im  just  going  to

scale  this  up  and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl

to  lock  the  proportions  like  that

let  me  move  this  towards  the  center  over

here  im  going  to  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  then  go  to  object

ungroup  and  now  that  is  no  longer  a  text

object  these  are  now  individual  letters

so  let  me  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  im  going  to  take  this  letter

k  and  bring  this  over  here  to  the  right

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it  onto

the  horizontal  axis  and  then  ill  do  the

same  thing  with  the  letter  i  over  here

ill  move  this  over  like  that

basically  what  were  doing  here  is  were

spacing  out  these  letters  we  want  to

have  a  lot  of  space  between  these

letters

in  order  for  us  to  do  what  were  going

to  do  in  this  tutorial  so  once  were

finished  well  go  back  and  and  bring  the

letters  closer  back  together  but  for  now

we  need  them  spaced  out

so  with  them  spaced  out  like  that  what

im  going  to  do  now  is  click  and  drag

over  all  three  of  them  and  go  to  path

union  so  now  theyre  unified

so  now  i  will  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  by  going  to

object

fill  and  stroke

and  that  will  open  up  this  menu  over

here  on  the  right  hand  side  of  your

screen  so  im  going  to  apply  a  yellow

color  to  this

im  going  to  give  this  a  linear  gradient

over  here  in  the  fill  tab  im  going  to

click  this  button  that  says  linear

gradient  im  going  to  grab  the  gradient

tool

click  on  this  end  of  the  gradient  right

here  and  bring  the  opacity  all  the way

up  and  im  going  to  change  this  to  a

different  color  maybe  like  a  reddish

orange  like  that

and  then  ill  take  this  end  of  the

gradient  and  put  this  down  here  towards

the  bottom  of  the  text  and  ill  take

this  end  and  put  it  towards  the  top  of

the  text  like  that  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  so  it  goes  straight  up  and  down

like  that

so  now  we  end  up  with  some  gradient  text

like  that

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  let  me

grab  the  select  tool

im  going  to  duplicate  this  by  pressing

ctrl  d  on  the  keyboard  and  its  going  to

create  a  duplicate  copy  even  though

nothing  visually  changed  on  the  screen

you  can  see  there  is  indeed  a  duplicate

copy  there  so  im  going  to  take  that

duplicate  copy  and  im  going  to  make

that  a  dark  shade  of  red  like  that

and  then  im  going  to  duplicate  this

again  by  pressing  ctrl  d  again  and  i

will  make  this  one  just  a  random

different  color  maybe  something  like

green  so  we  can  see  it  better

now  im  going  to  use  my  arrow  keys  im

going  to  press  down  on  the  arrow  key  and

then  im  going  to  press  right  on  the

arrow  key  and  its  going  to  offset  it  by

two  steps  like  that  one  down  and  one

right  and  im  basically  going  to  repeat

that  process  a  few  more  times

like  that

until  we  end  up  with

this  red  text  looking  the  way  it  does

right  here  basically  what  im  doing  here

is  im  creating  the  inner  shadow  of  this

text  right  here

so  that  is  what  im  paying  attention  to

here  that  size  right  there  is  pretty

good  maybe  ill  do  one  more  step  like

that

and  once  youve  done  that  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  red  text  so  that  you  have

both  of  those  text  items  selected  and  go

to  extensions

generate  from  path

extrude

and  from  the  mode  i  want  to  make  sure  i

have  polygons  selected  and  im  going  to

click  apply

and  then  click

close  out  of  that  menu  by  clicking  the  x

im  going  to  take  this  green  text  right

here  or  you  know  what  let  me  undo  that

by  pressing  control  z  let  me  click  off

of  the  graphic  to  deselect  everything

first

and  then  ill  take  this  green  text

object  and  press  delete  on  the  keyboard

to  get  rid  of  it

and  then  i  will  take  this  newly

generated

extruded  path  right  here  and  select  that

make  sure  you  have  that  selected  and  not

the  text  youll  know  you  have  it

selected  when  you  see  down  here  in  the

status  indicator  if  i  have  the  text

selected  its  going  to  be  red  if  i  have

the  extruded  path  selected  its  going  to

be

those  partially  uh  transparent  color  of

black  right  there  so  let  me  ungroup  that

by  going  to  object  ungroup

and  then  path

union

and  then  i  will  hold  shift  and  click  on

the  red  text  and  go  to  path

intersection  so  that  we  end  up  with  this

right  here  where  it  looks  like  its  an

inner  shadow  on  the  text  it  almost  kind

of  looks  like  the  text  is  carved  into

the  canvas  like  that

so  lets  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  what  im  going  to  do  now  is

let  me  click  on  just  this  red  text  right

here  this  red  shadow  and  im  going  to

give  this  a  linear  gradient  as  well

im  going  to  grab  the  gradient  tool  im

going  to  take  the  transparent  end  of  the

gradient  and  put  it  down  here

and  then  take  the  opaque  end  of  the

gradient  and  put  it  up  here  like  that

again  holding  shift  to  lock  uh  lock  it

onto  the  vertical  axis  like  that  maybe

ill  bring  that  down  a  little  more

okay  that  looks  good

so  lets  grab  the  select  tool  now  im

going  to  click  on  the  yellow  text  right

there  to  make  sure  i  have  that  selected

and  then  im  going  to  duplicate  that  by

pressing  ctrl  d

and  i  want  to  give  this  an  outline  so

im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on

this  color  yellow  down  here  to  give  this

yellow  outline  and  if  you  zoom  in  on

this  by  holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  the

mouse  wheel  you  can  see  that  there  is  an

outline  there  we  want  that  outline  to  be

a  little  bigger  though  and  we  want  to

get  rid  of  the  fill  color  so  let  me

click  on  the  x  right  here  the  red  x  to

get  rid  of  the  fill  color  and  ill  come

over  here  to  the  stroke  style  menu

and  im  just  going  to  hover  my  cursor

over  these  numbers  right  here  and  just

roll  up  the  mouse  wheel  to  increase  the

size  of  that  stroke  right  there

and  that  size  right  there  looks  pretty

good  ill  leave  that  as  it  is  where  it

says  join  make  sure  you  have  the  miter

join  right  here  so  we  have  square

corners  and  then  lets  convert  this

stroke  to  a  path  well  go  to  object

well  go  to  path  stroke  to  path

now  lets  zoom  out  a  little  bit

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  im  going

to  duplicate  that  outline  by  pressing

ctrl  d

and  i  will  give  this  a  different  color

like  green

and  again  im  going  to  use  my  arrow  keys

down  and  right

to  move  this  over

like  that

and  ill  take  it  about  that  far  what

were  doing  with  this  object  right  here

were  creating  the  base

of  the  text  which  is  located  right  here

this  dark  red  area  thats  what  were

creating  right  here  so  you  want  to

position  it  accordingly  that  right  there

looks  pretty  good  ill  leave  that  as  it

is  and  then  im  going  to  duplicate  this

one  more  time  by  pressing  ctrl  d  and  i

will  make  this  one  an  even  different

color  maybe  even  red  and  ill  move  this

one  down  here  like  this

or  you  know  what  let  me  make  this

let  me  make  this  orange  for  now

take  this

move  this  down  into  the  left  like  that

this  one  is  going  to  represent  the

shadow  being  casted  here

so  that  one  needs  to  be  placed

accordingly  so  im  going  to  place  this

one  over  here  like  that  now  lets  zoom

in  on  this  so  we  can  see  it  better  im

going to  hold  ctrl  and  roll  up  the  mouse

wheel  i  want  to  select  this  yellow

outline  that  we  originally  created  and

then  hold  shift  and  select  this  green

outline  that  we  created  next  and  with

them  both  selected  go  to  extensions

generate  from  path  extrude

click  apply

and  then  close  out  of  it  like  that  now

let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  click  off

of  it  to  deselect  everything

select  the  newly  extruded  area  like  that

and  go  to  object  on  group

and  then  path

union  and  then  i  want  to  get  rid  of  the

black  stroke  going  around  it  or  the

outline  so  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  red  x  over  here

and  let  me  come  over  here  to  the  fill

menu

under  the  hsl  tab  im  going  to  come  over

here  to  the  alpha  channel  and  bring  that

all  the  way  up  so  that  its  visible  and

then  i  will  send  that  to  the  bottom  with

this  button  right  here  that  says

uh  lower  selection  to  the  bottom

okay  so  now  i  will  make  that  the  same

color  of  dark  red  that  i  previously

applied  to  that  inner  shadow  right  there

so  let  me  apply  that  color

and  now

im  going  to  select  the  orange  outline

right  here

hold  shift  select  the  green  outline  so

that  we  have  them  both  selected  and  go

to  extensions

generate  from  path

extrude

and  were  doing  the  same  thing  here  just

click  apply

close  out  of  that

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

take  just  this

black  shape  right  here  that  we  just

extruded  go  to  object

ungroup

path

union

get  rid  of  the  black  outline  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  the  x  over  here

bring  the  alpha  channel  all  the  way  up

and  then  send  this  to  the  bottom  with

this  button  right  here  that  says  lower

selection  to  the  bottom  and  im  actually

going  to  take  the  opacity  of  this  and

bring  that  down  a  little  bit  for  now

were  going  to  go  back  and  work  with

this  later  but  for  now  i  just  want  to

bring  that  opacity  down

and  then  we  can  click  off  with  the

deselect  everything

so  im  going  to  take  this  orange  shape

right  here  press  delete  on  the  keyboard

to  get  rid  of  it  take  this  green  shape

right  here  press  delete  on  the keyboard

to  get  rid  of  it

and  if  i  zoom  out  you  can  see  its

starting  to  come  together  here  i  want  to

add  some  more  color  in  here  first  though

so  let  me  select  this  base  of  the  text

right  here  this  dark  red  object  and  im

going  to  give  this  a  linear  gradient

and  im  going  to  grab  the  gradient  tool

and  im  going  to  make  this  end  of  the

gradient

first  of  all  let  me  make  that  fully

opaque  like  that  and  im  just  going  to

make  this  a  lighter  color  of  red  like

that  and  ill  take  the  lighter  end  of

the  gradient  put  it  down  here  and  the

darker  end  of  the  gradient  goes  up  here

like  that

okay  so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  im

going  to  fill  in  the  base  of  the  text

here  with  shapes  as  you  can  see  here

its  darker  down  here  at  the  bottom  and

its  darker  over  here  and  these  little

lips  that  come  off  the  top  of  the  of  the

letters  there

so  lets  go  and  add  that  in  im  gonna

grab  first  of  all  let  me  grab  the  select

tool  let  me  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything  and  let  me  enable  snapping  up

here  now  in  this  under  the  snapping  menu

i  want  to  make  sure  i  have  this  one

enabled  right  here  that  says  toggle

snapping  to  cusp  nodes  including

rectangular  corners  and  if  thats  grayed

out  and  you  cant  enable  it  you  may  have

to  enable  this  one  first  and  then  you

can  enable  that  so  with  that  enabled

grab  the  bezier  pen  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  could  press  the  letter

b  on  the  keyboard  let  me  zoom  in  on  this

im  going  to  snap  to  this  corner  or  you

know  before  i  do  that  make  sure  you  have

the  mode  set  to  the  proper  mode  which  is

the  first  one  here  where  it  says  create

regular  bezier  path  select  that  one

first  for  whatever  reason  this  version

of  inkscape  always  defaults  to  this  one

right  here  so  you  will  if  youre  using

this  version  of  inkscape  youll  have  to

manually  click  on  that

so  let  me  snap  to  this  corner  and  click

snap  to  this  corner  and  click

same  thing  over  here

same  thing  over  here  and  then  back  to

the  starting  point  like  that  and  we  have

that  shape  that  we  just  drew  in  there

like  that  i  want  to  come  back  over  here

im  going  to  draw  this  shape  in  here

like  this  as  well

and  again  to  move  the  page  around  like

that  im  just  pressing  down  the  mouse

wheel  and  moving  the  mouse  im  going  to

come  over  here  and  fill  in  this  shape  as

well

do  the  same  thing  down  here

and  then  ill  come  up  here  and  fill  in

this  part  of  the  top  of  the  letter  right

here  and  then  im  just  going  to  go

through  and  do  this  for  the  rest  of  the

text

okay  so  once  youre  finished  drawing  the

shapes  lets  grab  the  select  tool  over

here  lets  turn  off  snapping  now  we

dont  need  that  anymore  im  going  to

click  and  drag  over  the  bottom  of  the

text  down  here  just  to  select  those

objects  that  ive  just  drawn

and  im  going  to  make  them  a  darker

shade  of  red  so  let  me  grab  the  uh  the

uh  dropper  tool  which  is  located  over

here  or  you  could  press  the  letter  d

and  im  going  to  sample  this  color  right

here  to  make  that  darker  i  might  even

make  that  a  little  darker  than  it

currently  is

and  then  i  want  to  get  rid  of  the  black

outline  by  holding  shift  and  clicking  on

the  x  and  there  we  go

im  going  to  do  the  same  thing  up  here

to  these  items  let  me  zoom  out  a  little

bit  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over  the

top  of  the  text  to  select  those  items

right  there  and  i  will  make  those  a

darker  shade  of  red  as  well  let  me  hold

shift  click  the  red  x  to  get  rid  of  the

outline  and  for  this  i  want  to  make  this

one  a  little  darker  as  well

okay  looking  better

okay  so  at  this  point  lets  grab  the

select  tool  and  click  off  of  the  the

graphic  to  deselect  everything  at  this

point  were  almost  done  were  just  going

to  start  bringing  these  letters  together

now  so  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

everything  here

to  make  sure  everything  is  selected  and

then  grab  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

click  and  drag  over  these  nodes  right

here  for  this  letter  over  here  and  im

just going  to  hold  the  left  arrow  key  to

bring  this  letter  over  like  this

so  that  its  closer  together  to  the

other  letter

okay  looking  good  and  then  ill  click

and  drag  over  all  of  these  letters  right

here  or  just  these  two  letters  and  then

bring  both  of  those  over  by  again

holding  down  the  left  arrow  key

okay  looking  good  and  you  can  grab  the

select  tool  now  and  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything  and  what  were  going

to  do  next  is  lets  create  the

background  this  um  this  colored

background  with  the  gradient  for  the

text  here  so  lets  go  back  in  there  what

im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool

and  create  a  rectangle  going  over  the

text  like  that

and  im  going  to  send  that  im  going  to

grab  the  select  tool  im  going  to  lower

that  to  the  bottom

and  then  im  going  to  open  up  the  align

and  distribute  menu  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  can

press  the  letters  uh  control  shift  and  a

on  your  keyboard

and  from  the  relative  two  i  want  to  make

sure  i  have  last  selected  chosen

with  this  rectangle  selected  im  going

to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the  text  item

right  there  and  just  make  sure  i  have

that  centered  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  and  now  im  going  to

change  the  page  border  to  fit  this

selection  to  do  that  just  press  ctrl

shift

r  on  the  keyboard  and  if  you  click  off

it  to  deselect  everything  you  can  see

that  the  page  border  now  represents  that

shape  there  so  let  me  ctrl  z  that  to  put

that  back  im  going  to  change  the  the

color  of  this  background  here  let  me  go

to  the  fill  and  stroke  menu  im  going  to

make  this  a  lighter  shade  of  purple

maybe  something  like  that

i  will  give  this  a  radial  gradient

grab  the  gradient  tool

click  on  this  end  of  the  gradient  up

here  and  bring  the  opacity  of  that  all

the  way  up  and  im  going  to  double  click

this  line  right  here  to  add  a  new  stop

into  that  gradient

now  im  going  to  take  this  middle  stop

this  center  node  of  the  gradient  and  im

going  to  make  that  lighter  like  that

and  ill  take  this  end  of  the  stop  right

here  and  ill  make  that  slightly  lighter

not  by  much  just  a  little  bit

and  then  ill  bring  this  out  a  little

bit  like  that  let  me  bring  this  stop  up

like  that  im  going  to  hold  ctrl

to  bring  that  up  and  then  ill  take  this

end  over  here  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

shift  and  bring  this  out  like  that

let  me  just  adjust  that  a  little  bit

okay  looking  pretty  good

so  what  i  will  do  now  is  i  will  grab  the

select  tool  i  will  take  the  text  right

here  bring  the  op  take  the  text  shadow

rather  bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up

and  i  want  to  make  this  a  similar  shade

as  this  purple  over  here  so  let  me  grab

the  dropper  and  sample  that  right  there

and  there  we  go  now  you  can  grab  the

select  tool  and  you  can  make  this  you

can  make  the  shadow  darker  or  lighter

based  on  your  own  preference  so  im

going  to  leave  mine

right  about  there

so  the  final  step  of  this  tutorial  would

be  to  add  the  texture  to  the  finished

design  here  so  to  do  that

before  i  do  that  what  i  want  to  do  first

is  i  want  to  open  up  the  layers  menu

which  is  located  over  here  or  you  could

press  ctrl  shift  and  l  on  the  keyboard

to  open  that  up

now  if  you  notice  here  everything  that

weve  created  so  far  exists  on  this  one

layer  i  want  to  put  the  texture  on  its

own  layer  so  im  going  to  click  this

button  up  here  that  says  create  a  new

layer

im  going  to  leave  the  default  as  it  is

make  sure  you  have  the  position  set  to

above  current  and  click  add  and  theres

our  new  layer

so  im  going  to  take  my  texture  image

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  to

where  you  can  download  this  texture

image  just  go  ahead  and  copy  and  paste

it  into  your  document  here  or  you  can

just  click  and  drag  the  file  onto  your

canvas  which  is  what  im  going  to  do

make  sure  you  have  layer  2  activated  so

it  places  it  on  layer  2  and  im  going  to

click  and  drag  it  onto  my  canvas  like

that

and  the the  options  im  going  to  choose

here  i  want  to  choose  embed  i  want  to

choose  default  import  resolution  and

then  none  and  then  click  ok

and  theres  the  texture  image  so  let  me

select  this  rectangle  right  here  the

background  and  im  going  to  right  click

this  and  go  to  copy

and  then  i  want  to  select  the  texture

image  and  i  want  to  go  to  edit

paste  size

paste  size  and  thats  going  to  make  it

the  same  size  as  the  background  there

and  now  what  i  can  do  is  i  can  select

the  texture

hold  shift  select  the  background  so  we

have  them  both  selected  come  back  over

here  to  the  align  distribute  menu  and

center  that  up  vertically  and

horizontally  like  that  and  then  click

off  it  to  deselect  everything

now  what  i  will  do  is  i  will  select  just

the  texture  image

come  back  over  here  to  the  layers  menu

and  where  it  says  blend  mode  im  going

to  set  this  to  soft  light

right  there

and  there  you  go  that  is  how  you  can

create  that  uh  long  shadow  text  now  once

you  apply  that

you  may  want  to  change  a  few  things  like

im  going to  zoom  in  on  this  a little

bit  that  shadow  looks  a  little  lighter

now  that  the  texture  has  been  applied  so

what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

lock  layer  2  up  here  so  that  i  cant

change  the  texture

and  im  going  to  continue  working  on  the

objects  down  here  so  with  layer  2  locked

the  texture  stays  in  place  and  you  wont

be  able  to  move  it  so  im  going  to

select  layer  1  and  then  ill  come  over

here  im  going  to  select  the  shadow  let

me  come  back  over  here  to  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  maybe  make  that  a little

darker

that  looks  good  and  im  going  to  grab

the  gradient  tool  and  maybe  change  the

gradient  of  this  inner  shadow  right  here

maybe  bring  that  down  a  little  bit  so

thats  a  little  more  visible

okay  looking  good  let  me  go  back  to  the

select  tool  now  if  you  want  to  bring

down  the  intensity  of  that  texture  what

you  can  do  is  you  can  come  back  over

here  to  your  layers  menu  you  can  select

layer  two  you  can  unlock  it

and  if  you  can  unlock  it  and  if  you  want

what  you  can  do  is  you  can  select  this

image  come  back  over  here  to  the  fill

and  stroke  menu  and  you  can  change  the

opacity  of  the  image  to  control  the

intensity  of  that  texture  like  that  so

im  going  to  put  it  back  up  to  100  to

where  it  was  because  i  like  how  that

looks  like  that  and  that  should  do  it

for  this  tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go

about  creating  this  long  shadow  text

effect  using  inkscape  if  you  have  any
