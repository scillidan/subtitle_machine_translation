in  todays  lesson  well  be  having  a  look

at  a  path  effect  in  inkscape  that  allows

you  to  draw  in  mirror  mode  it  works  by

creating  a  copy  of  what  youve  created

and  mirroring  it  on  an  opposing  axis

whats  more  any  edits  that  you  make  to

the  original  copy  will  also  be  applied

to  the  mirrored  copy  lets  have  a



look  so  getting  us  started  here  at

inkscape  the  first  thing  Im  going  to  do

is  demonstrate  how  this  feature  works

and  then  I  will  give  you  a  working

example  of  when  this  sort  of  feature

would  be  useful  so  to  start  us  out  here

lets  create  a  circle  Im  going  to  grab

the  circles  and  ellipses  tool  and  Im

going  to  hold  control  on  my  keyboard  and

click  and  drag  so  we  get  a  nice  round

circle  like  that  now  what  Im  going  to

do  is  Im  going  to  use  the  mirror

symmetry  path  effect  to  create  a

mirrored  copy  of  this  object  and

whatever  I  do  to  this  object  will  also

happen  to  the  mirrored  object  let  me

show  you  what  I  mean  with  the  circle

selected  Ill  go  to  path  and  I  will

select  path

effects  and  from  the  path  effects  menu

over  here  Im  going  to  choose  the  little

plus  icon  down  here  in  the  bottom  right

corner  Im  going  to  click  on  that  to  add

a  new  path  effect  and  the  path  effect

Im  looking  for  is  called  mirror

symmetry  which  is  right  there  you  could

also  access  it  by  just  typing  into  the

search  bar  here  m  i  r  r  begin  typing  it

and  there  it  is  right  there  mirror

symmetry  and  as  you  can  see  there  its

going  to  take  the  uh  object  and  create  a

cloned  copy  over  of  it  over  here  on  the

right  hand  side  now  if  you  want  to  edit

this  object  just  grab  your  edit  paths  by

nodes  tool  and  you  should  notice  Let  Me

zoom  in  on  on  this  you  should  notice

this  blue  line  going  between  the  two

objects  now  if  I  take  this  node  in  the

center  and  move  this  over  like  this  you

can  see  that  Im  moving  the  object  the

Clones  copy  away  from  the  original  one

and  these  nodes  down  here  I  can  use

these  nodes  to  rotate  the  Clones  copy

like  that  if  need  be  the  bottom  one

rotates  it  that  way  and  the  top  one  will

rotate  it  this  way  like  that  okay  so  the

way  this  works  is  anything  I  do  to  this

object  will  also  happen  to  this  object

so  if  I  select  this  object  and  then  make

this  green  both  objects  will  become

green  if  I  take  this  node  right  here  and

bring  in  the  width  like  that  as  you  can

see  the  width  of  the  other  object

changes  as  well  like  that  and  now  we  are

drawing  in  mirror  symmetry  so  once  Im

finished  using  this  effect  and  I  want  to

finalize  this  I  can  go  to  path  object  to

path  and  if  I  grab  my  nodes  tool  I

already  have  it  selected  you  can  see

these  are  now  two  individual  paths  these

are  no  longer  linked  as  mirrored  copies

these  were  just  individual  paths  that

were  created  from  a  mirrored  copy  and

thats  prettyy  much  the  basics  of  how

the  mirror  symmetry  path  effect  works  in

inkscape  so  lets  have  a  look  at  a

working  example  of  when  something  like

this  would  be  useful  the  example  Im

going  to  use  here  is  creating  an  emoji

smiley  face  so  let  me  grab  my  circles

and  ellipses  tool  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  on  the  canvas  like  that  Im  going

to  hold  control  and  I  want  to  make  my

smiley  face  yellow  Im  going  to  grab  the

selection  tool  Im  going  to  duplicate

this  circle  by  pressing  control  D  Ill

make  this  copy  white  and  then  Ill  hold

contr  control  and  shift  and  Ill  scale

this  down  like  that  this  circle  right

here  is  actually  going  to  represent  a

smile  the  bottom  half  of  the  circle

anyway  its  going  to  be  the  smiling  uh

face  of  the  uh  Emoji  here  and  so  in

order  to  turn  this  into  a  smiley  I  need

to  cut  off  this  bottom  part  right  here

Im  going  to  use  the  rectangle  tool  to

do  that  Im  going  to  click  and  drag  to

create  a  rectangle  going  over  that

bottom  half  like  that  Im  going  to

change  this  to  a  different  color  cuz  Id

like  to  be  able  to  see  this  rectangle

Ill  make  this  red  and  I  will  bring  down

the  opacity  of  this  as  well  Ill  just

make  this  something  like  50  just  so  I

can  see  through  it  there  and  if  you

notice  the  intersecting  area  between  the

circle  and  the  red  rectangle  is  going  to

represent  the  smiley  face  so  Im  going

to  grab  the  selection  tool  hold  shift

click  on  the  circle  so  we  have  both  the

rectangle  and  the  circle  selected  and  go

to  path  and  select  intersection  and

there  is  the  smile  part  of  the  Emoji  now

what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

create  a  single  eye  up  here  and  then  Im

going  to  use  the  mirror  symmetry  path

effect  to  create  the  other  eye  for  the

other  side  so  that  I  can  adjust  the  two

eyes  together  at  the  same  time  so  let  me

grab  the  uh  circles  and  ellipses  tool

click  and  drag  to  create  a  circle  hold

control  like  that  let  me  make  this  white

let  me  bring  the  opacity  of  this  back  up

to

100%  grab  the  selection  tool  now  for

what  I  want  to  do  the  way  I  want  to  edit

this  I  want  to  convert  this  circle  into

a  path  so  let  me  go  to  path  and  choose

object  to  path  and  thats  now  a  path

with  nodes  on  it  rather  than  a  circle

object  so  let  me  right  click  this  and  go

to  duplicate  Ill  make  this  one  black

Im  going  to  hold  control  and  shift  like

that  scale  that  down  and  maybe  even  move

that  down  a  little  bit  like  that  so  what

Im  going  to  do  is  I  want  to  group  these

two  objects  together  the  White  and  the

black  circle  and  I  want  to  group  them

together  as  a  single  unit  so  that  I  can

mirror  both  objects  at  the  same  time  so

Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

circle  with  them  both  selected  go  to

object  group  and  now  Im  going  to  mirror

the  grouped  object  so  Im  going  to  click

the  plus  icon  down  here  again  our  path

effects  menu  click  plus  mirror

symmetry  and  now  we  have  another  copy

over  over  there  Im  going  to  grab  the

edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  Im  going  to

move  this  one  over  Im  going  to  hold

control  while  Im  doing  this  to  make

sure  it  stays  locked  on  that  same

horizontal  axis  that  the  other  eye  is  on

and  now  what  I  could  do  is  I  could  take

this  object  here  hold  shift  take  this

object  here  with  the  nodes  tool  select

them  both  Im  going  to  turn  on  the

transformation  handles  like  that  and  if

I  select  all  of  these  nodes  like  that  I

can  now  take  these  nodes  and  scale  these

eyes  up  and  down  like  that  and  as  you

can  see  whatever  change  I  make  to  the

one  eye  is  also  happening  to  the  other

eye  and  I  can  also  rotate  this  around  if

i  like  as  you  can  see  here  Im  rotating

the  eyes  around  I  can  move  them  over

like

this  maybe  Ill  deselect  that  Ill

select  just  this  one  right  here  and  Ill

make  this  one  whoops  there  we  go  make

this  one  a  little  bigger  like

that  and  Im  sure  you  get  the  idea

anything  that  I  do  to  this  grouping  of

objects  will  also  happen  to  this

grouping  of  objects  over  here

okay  so  Ill  take  this  one  right  here

move  this  one

over  maybe  up  a  little  bit  turn  off  the

transformation  handles  when  Im

done  and  there  you  go  that  is  how  I  was

able  to  use  the  mirror  symmetry  tool  to

create  one  eye  and  create  a  copy  a

symmetry  a  mirror  symmetry  copy  of  the

other  eye  and  I  can  edit  them  together

by  just  editing  one  of  them  so  that  is

just  one  example  of  how  you  can  use  the

mirror  symmetry  path  effect  in  inkscape

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  $17  one  time  and  youre  in  for

Life  Ill  have  some  information  about

that  down  below  if  you  want  to  check
