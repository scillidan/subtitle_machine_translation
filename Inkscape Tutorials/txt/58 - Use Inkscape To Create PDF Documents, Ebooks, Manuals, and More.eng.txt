this  is  nick  with  logos  by  nick.com  and

in  this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  use

inkscape  for  desktop  publishing  purposes

to  create  things  like  reports

manuals  ebooks  and  various  other  types

of  pdf  documents

now  granted  inkscape  probably  isnt  the

best  tool  for  this  sort  of  thing

but  if  you  just  need  to  create  a  simple

one  or  two  page  document

or  maybe  even  a  short  ebook  and  youre

already  somewhat  familiar  with  inkscape

then  it  would  probably  be  more  practical

than  taking  the  time  to  learn

an  entirely  new  piece  of  software  like

scribus  or  indesign

ive  used  inkscape  myself  to  create

manuals  and  ebooks  in  the  past  so  i  know

that  its  perfectly  capable  in  that

regard

before  we  get  started  though  if  youd

like  to  learn  everything  that  there  is

to  know  about  inkscape

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over

every  tool  and  feature  in  inkscape  and  i

explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate  how

it  works

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

im  going  to  open  up  a  new  document  and

then  set  up  the  documents  that  we  are

all  working  with  a  similar  workflow

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  view  make

sure  we  have  custom  selected

and  then  come  up  to  zoom  and  go  to  zoom

in  at  one  to  one

and  then  well  open  up  the  align  and

distribute  menu  with  this  button  right

here

and  then  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  with  this  button  right  here

and  over  here  where  it  says  snapping  we

want  to  make  sure  we  have  enable

snapping  enabled

and  we  want  this  one  enabled  right  here

that  says  snap  nodes

pads  and  handles  we  also  want  this  one

enabled  that  says  snap  to  cusp  nodes

including  rectangle  corners

and  the  one  next  to  it  as  well  snap  to

smoothnose  were  going to  enable  that

and  then  over  here  where  it  says  snap

text  anchors  and  baselines

enable  that  and  then  finally  over  here

where  it  says  snap  to  the  page  border

enable  that  as  well

and  also  youre  going  to  want  to  make

sure  you  have  snap  guides  enabled  as

well

but  that  should  be  enabled  by  default

but  if  its  not  go  ahead  and  enable  that

so  what  i  want  to  do  now  is  set  up  the

canvas  so  that  its  suitable  for

creating  these

pdf  documents  were  going  to  create  so

well  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

file

click  on  document  properties

then  where  it  says  display  units  i  want

to  change  that  to  inches

and  over  here  where  it  says  page  size  we

have  a  list  of  templates  here  im  going

to  choose  us

letter  which  is  8.5  by  11  inches  if  you

want  to  create  something  like  an  a5  or

an  a1  or  maybe  even  us  legal  you  can  use

that  if  you  want  for  this  tutorial  im

just  going to  do  the  standard  8.5  by  11

inches

over  here  where  it  says  border  we  want

to  leave  show  page  border  enabled

border  on  top  of  drawing  were  going  to

enable  that  that  should  be  helpful  when

were  creating  our  design

and  then  show  border  shadow  lets  just

disable  that

and  then  finally  over  here  where  it  says

background  color  im  going  to  change

this

im  going  to  click  on  the  hsl  tab  and

im  going  to  come  down  here  to  the  l  row

and  slide  this  to  the  left  a little  bit

if  you  notice  the  canvas

is  becoming  darker  as  i  do  that  and  we

want  the  canvas  to  be  slightly  darker

than  white  because

white  is  going  to  be  the  color  of  the

page  we  create  here

so  let  me  close  out  of  that  we  should  be

all  set  now  close  out  of  that

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  create  a

rectangle  to  place  in  this  page  border

here  is  going  to  represent  the  white

page  of  the  document  so  ill  grab  the

squares  and  rectangles  tool

and  ill  snap  to  the  top  left  corner  of

the  page  click  and  drag  and  then  snap  to

the  bottom  right  corner  of  the  page  to

create  this  rectangle  there

and  i  want  to  make  this  rectangle  white

make  sure  your  opacity  is  all  the way  up

at  100

and  make  sure  you  dont  have  an  outline

around  your  object  otherwise  known  as  a

stroke  if  you  do  have  a  stroke  added  to

your  object  just  hold

shift  and  click  this  red  x  down  here  to

get  rid  of  it

and  then  finally  up  here  where  it  says

make  shoulders  make  corners  sharp  we

want  to  make  sure  we  have  sharp  corners

while  were  doing  this  so  if  this  is  not

grayed  out  go  ahead  and  click  on  that

we  dont  want  our  page  to  have  rounded

corners

okay  so  now  that  we  have  our  page  set  we

need  to  define  the  content

area  of  this  page  we  dont  want  the

content  to  run  all  the  way  to  the  edges

here  so  we  want  to  create  one  inch  of

padding  going  around  the  document  here

so  to  do  that  let  me  grab  the  select

tool  let  me  right  click  on  this

dot  this  rectangle  here  and  go  to

duplicate  and  im  just  going  to  make

this  red  so  we  can  differentiate  it  this

is  just  temporarily

and  up  here  where  it  says  width  and

height  or  w  and  h

were  going  to  remove  an  inch  from  each

dimension  so  its  going  to  be  7.5  by  11.

before  we  do  this  though  make  sure  you

dont  have  this  lock  icon  enabled  make

sure  its  disabled  like  i  have  it  here

so  im  going  to  change  this  to  7.5

im  going  to  hit  tab  to  skip  over  to  the

height  and  change  that  to  10

and  then  press  enter  and  it  should  now

be  an  inch  smaller  now  what  we  have  to

do  is  center  this

up  on  the  page  so  where  it  says  relative

to  change  this  to  page  over  here  in  the

align  distribute  menu

and  were  looking  for  center  on  vertical

axis  and  center  on  horizontal  axis

and  this  right  here  is  going  to  define

where  the  contents  of  the  page

are  we  dont  want  to  leave  this  red

object  sitting  here  though  so  were

going  to  convert  this  to  guides

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  object  and

go  to

convert  objects  to  guides  and  now  we

have  guides  there  to  reference  as  were

creating  our  design

so  the  first  thing  were  going  to  do  to

create  the  design  that  i  showed  you  in

the  beginning  of  the  video  is  were

going  to  create  some

header  text  or  title  text  up  here  let  me

grab  the

text  tool  let  me  click  and  drag  actually

im  going  to  snap  to  the  corner  of  these

these  guides  over  here  and  then  just

click  and  drag  to  create  a  title  area

im  just  going  to  title  this  monthly

report

and  im  going  to  change  this  make  this

bold

maybe  make  this  a  smaller  size  go  with

something  like  20

and  if  you  want  to  change  the  font  you

can  do  so  over  here  im  going  to  leave

the  default  sans  font

for  now  leave  that  now  i  want  to  put  a

page

number  over  here  so  let  me  just

duplicate  this  text  object  ill  right

click  it  go  to  duplicate

and  ill  change  this  let  me  grab  the

text  tool  change  this  to  zero

one  because  this  will  be  page  one  and

let  me  uh

let  me  make  this  a  little  smaller  first

of  all  i  wanna  remove  the  bold  im  gonna

make  this  normal

and  then  ill  just  make  this  maybe

something  like  16

that  looks  pretty  good  and  now  we  can

just  place  this  in  the  top  right  corner

over  here

im  going  to  zoom  in  on  this  to  zoom  in

im  just  holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  the

mouse  wheel  to  move  the  page  just  press

down  the  mouse  wheel  and  move  the  mouse

i  just  want  to  manually  place  this  in

the  corner  here  unfortunately  these  text

objects  will  not  snap  into

your  guides  unless  its  the  base  of  the

text  object  like  you  see  here  but

thats  not  what  were  looking  for  so

were  going  to  leave  that  right  there  as

it  is  let  me  zoom  back  out

and  now  i  just  want  to  create  like  a

little  divider  to  put  right  here  so  im

going  to  grab  the  rectangle  tool  again

click  and  drag  to  create  like  a  little

rectangle  going  from  one  side  to  the

other

thats  looking  pretty  good  ill  make

this  something  like  yellow

grab  the  select  tool  move  this  up  like

that

let  me  zoom  in  so  i  can  get  a  little

closer  there  we  go  thats  what  im

looking  for

and  i  want  to  make  a  copy  of  this

divider  and  put  it  at  the  bottom  of  the

page  too  so  let  me  right  click  this  and

go  to  duplicate

and  i  will  put  this  divider  at  the

bottom  of  the  page  where  the  bottom  of

the  margin  is

and  now  i  want  to  create  some  content

area  for  our  design  here

what  im  going  to  do  for  this  particular

design  im  going  to  create  two  columns

of  text

if  you  want  you  could  just  use  one  giant

block  of  text  im  going  to  put  a  little

more  design  into  this  so  im  going to

use  two  columns  of  text  here  so

let  me  grab  the  rectangle  tool  again  let

me  create  another  rectangle  going

through  the  uh

through  the  uh  guidelines  here  and  let

me  just  make  this  red  let  me  bring  down

the  opacity

and  i  want  to  divide  this  up  into  two

separate  evenly  sized  and  evenly  spaced

apart

rectangle  so  to  do  that  im  going  to

create  another  rectangle  going  through

the  center  here

like  this  and  im  going  to  center  that

up  on  the  page

grab  the  select  tool  hold  shift

click  on  the  object  there  and  go  to  path

difference  so  those  are  now  two

different  objects  and  im  just  going  to

zoom  in  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  roll  up

the  mouse  wheel  to  zoom  in  a little  bit

position  this  down  here  a  little  further

we  dont  want  this

we  dont  want  this  flush  against  the

guide  here  because  the  text  is  going  to

be  in  this  red  area  we  dont  want  the

text  to  be  stacked  on  top  of  this

divider  so

a  little  bit  of  padding  in  there  should

help  something  like  that  looks  pretty

good

and  i  dont  want  these  text  columns  to

be  this  high  so  im  just  going  to  take

this  top  arrow  and  just  bring  this  down

im  going  to  leave  these  two  text

columns  right

here  and  im  going  to  put  some  other

contents  up  here

which  we  will  go  over  momentarily  so  let

me  zoom  in

lets  break  this  apart  into  two  separate

objects  well  go  to  path

break  apart  and  now  well  go  to

objects  object  to  guides

and  we  now  just  created  guides  that  we

can  reference  for  placing  our  text

so  lets  go  ahead  and  place  some

placeholder  text  in  here  im  just  going

to  copy  and  paste

some  lorem  ipsum  dummy  text

and  let  me  grab  the  text  tool  over  here

click  and  drag  this  corner

down  to  here  like  that  im  just  going  to

hit  ctrl

v  to  paste  my  text  in  there  now  this  is

a  little  too  big  let  me

let  me  select  all  of  this  and  ctrl  a  to

select  all

i  want  to  bring  the  size  down  to  like

maybe  12.

im  just  going  to  go  ahead  and  add  some

more  text  in  here  now  let  me  just  copy

and  paste  more  of  this  alarm  if  some

text  now  if  you  notice

if  you  if  your  text  is  too  long  its

going  to  run  to  the  end  of  the  page  here

so  let  me  take  this  little  node  and  just

drag  this  down

and  as  you  can  see  the  text  is  running

through  the  edge  here  so  if

your  text  is  bleeding  out  to  the  edge

just  go  ahead  and  select  it  and  delete

it

and  youll  have  to  continue  it  on  in

this  column  over  here  this  is  one  of  the

reasons  why  i  think  inkscape  probably

isnt  the  best  tool  for  this  sort  of

thing  because

you  got  to  do  a  lot  of  manual  copy  and

pasting  with  the  text

if  you  want  if  you  notice  the  text  here

we  have  this  spacing  on  the  right  side

if  you  want  to  make  it  so  that  the  text

runs  to  the  to  the  edges  of  both  sides

uh  what  you  can  do  is  you  can  come  up  to

the  uh  justification  up  here

the  alignment  rather  and  then  change  to

change  it  to  this  option  right  here  and

if  you  notice  it  spaces  the  text  out  so

it  runs  to  the  edges  like  that

i  dont  like  how  that  looks  personally

it  looks  too  like  robotic  so  im  just

gonna

leave  it  as  it  was  before  and  then  were

gonna  do  the  same  thing  over  here  create

some  more  text  im  gonna  make  this  box

even  bigger  this  time  so  i  dont  have  to

change  the  size  of  it  and  again  were

just  gonna  uh

im  just  gonna  control  paste  use  this

dummy  text  here

let  me  select  all  control  a  to  select

all  change  the  size  of  this  to  match  the

size  of  the  other  text  im  gonna  use  12.

and  for  this  one  im  going  to  maybe

shorten  this

by  about  this  much  because  for  this

design  im  going  to  use

like  a  placeholder  graphic  over  here

like  a  chart  or  some  kind  of

pie  chart  or  something  like  that  go  back

to  the  select  tool

okay  so  now  that  part  is  done  what  we

could  do  now  is  create  like  a  text  area

in  here  like  a  like  a  header  section

to  do  that  im  going  to  grab  the  white

rectangle  that  represents  the  page

im  going  to  right  click  that  and  go  to

duplicate  and  im  just  going  to  take

this  bottom  arrow  and  scale  it  up  like

this

bring  it  up  to  about  there  let  me  change

the  color  of  this  so  we  can  see  what

were  doing  here  im  going  to  make  this

like  a  dark  shade  of  blue  like  that

you  can  use  whatever  color  you  like  ill

take  this  top  arrow  bring  this  down

and  were  going to  use  this  area  right

here  to  add  some  like  uh

leader  text  or  header  text  and  before  i

do  that  though  i  just  want  to  make  sure

that  this  is  evenly  spaced  out  between

this  text  object

this  blue  rectangle  and  this  yellow

divider  i  want  to  make  sure  all  three  of

these  are  evenly  spaced  out  so  im going

to  click  on  the  divider

hold  shift  click  on  the  blue  box  hold

shift

click  on  the  text  and  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  distribute

and  were  looking  for  this  icon  down

here  towards  the  bottom  right  that  says

make  vertical  gaps  between  objects  equal

go  ahead  and  click  on  that

and  there  we  go  so  let  me  uh  create  some

text  to  put  in  here  im  going to  grab

the  text  tool

snap  to  the  left  guide  right  here

put  that  right  there  im  just  going  to

use  header  text

im  going  to  make  that  white

and  maybe  ill  make  that  a  little  bigger

maybe  something  like  30  32  that  should

be  pretty  good

and  now  i  want  to  use  this  divider  for

this  design  im  going  to  use  this

divider  down  here  as  well  so  let  me  take

that  divider

duplicate  that  by  right  clicking  it

going  to  duplicate

put  this  over  here  and  i  want  this

divider  to  be  the  same  width  of  this

text  so  let  me  click  on  the  text

right  click  it  and  go  to  copy  and  then

click  on  the  divider  and  go  to  edit

paste  size  paste  with

and  then  i  can  go  ahead  and  paste  this

move  this  over  here  like  that

im  going  to  zoom  in  so  that  the  snaps

wont  get  in  the  way  there  we  go

and  now  im  going  to  put  some  subtext

down  here  so  let  me  click  on  this

right  click  it  duplicate  put  this  down

here

make  this  white  grab  the  text  tool  again

and  uh  sub

text  can  go  here

let  me  just  stack  this  next  to  it  like

that

now  its  looking  pretty  good  let  me  zoom

in  just  make  sure  these  are

evenly  spaced  apart  looking  pretty  good

now  im  going  to  put  some  text  in  here

on  this  right  side  to  do  that

let  me  grab  the  text  tool  im  going  to

start  over  here  on  this  guideline

click  and  drag  like  this  let  me  try  that

again  im  going  to  click  and  drag  to

create  this  text  box

ctrl  v  to  paste  there  we  go  make  that

white

uh  ctrl  a  to  select  it  all  im  going  to

make  this  one  slightly  bigger  than  this

body  text  over  here  so  this  was  size  to

12.  im  going  to  size  this  at  maybe  uh

16  see  how  that  looks

that  looks  pretty  good  im  going  to  go

ahead  and  remove  some  of  this  that  we

dont  have  so  much  of  that  in  there

okay  looking  pretty  good  now  if  youre

not  happy  with  the  width  of  this  text

what  you  can  do  is  let  me  zoom  in  a

little  bit

you  can  move  this  over  like  this

and  then  you  can  go  back  to  the  text

tool  and  take  this  node  right  here  and

just  snap  it  to  the  right  side  so  that

it  changes  the  uh  the  orientation  of  it

like  that

now  let  me  grab  the  select  tool  i  want

to  center  this  text  up  within  this  blue

object  so  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  blue  text  i  mean  the  blue

object

and  im  going  to  change  the  relative  to

im  going  to  change  that  to  last

selected

and  im  going  to  center  it  up  on  the

horizontal  axis  like  that

and  now  i  want  this  text  to  to  be

aligned  to  the  top  of  this

text  so  let  me  click  and  drag  over  those

three  objects  right  there  to  select  them

or  what  you  could  do  is  you  could  just

click  them  one  by  one  while  holding

shift

and  then  just  group  them  together  with

this  button  that  says  group  selected

objects

or  you  can  just  press  ctrl  g  hold  shift

click  on  this  text  right  here  and  then

just  where  it  says  uh  align  top  edges

click  on  that  and  that  right  there  is

what  were  looking  for  so  let  me  zoom

out  a  little  bit

let  me  click  off  of  this  to  deselect

everything  now  what  you  could  do  now  is

you  can  import  an  image  in  here  if  you

want  to  do  what  i  did  if  you  want  to

add  some  more  flair  to  this  design  what

im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

import  my  image  over  here  i  have  it

opened  up  on  my  other  monitor  if  i  can

just  find  it  we  go

ill  bring  my  folder  this  is  the  folder

right  here

ill  bring  it  into  the  screen  if  you

just  take  your  image  and  just  click  and

drag  it  onto  inkscape  like  that

leave  the  defaults  as  it  is  click  ok  and

theres  my  image

i  just  want  to  send  this  to  the  bottom

of  the  image  im  going  to  right  click

this

actually  no  im  going  to  come  over  here

to  where  it  says  lower  selection  to  the

bottom

click  on  that  and  then  i  want  to  raise

that  one  step  so  its  above

the  white  page  so  im  going to  click

this  button  over  here  that  says  raise

selection

one  step  and  if  at  any  point  you  want  to

see  how  your  design  is  looking  without

these  guides  in  the  way  you  could  just

come  over  here  where  it  says  view

and  then  deselect  guides  what  i  like  to

do  is  use  the  keyboard  shortcut  which  is

this

vertical  line  right  here  so  im  going  to

toggle  them  off  and  on  to  see  how  they

look

okay  so  let  me  center  this  up  on  the

blue  box  right  here  let  me  select  that

hold  shift  click  on  the  blue  box

center  it  up  vertically  and  horizontally

like  that  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything

take  just  this  blue  box  and  bring  the

opacity  down  a  little  bit  so

the  image  shows  beneath  it  then  i  want

to  take  this  image

hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  it  down

like  that

thats  pretty  good  let  me  zoom  in  move

this  up

okay  so  now  i  just  want  to  crop  this

image  so  that  it  fits  this  blue  square

right  here  so  let  me  take  the  blue

square

right  click  it  go  to  duplicate  hold

shift

click  on  the  image  and  go  to  object  clip

object  clip  set  and  there  we  go

now  let  me  take  this  and  just  adjust  the

opacity  so  that  some  of  it  shows  through

that  right  there  looks  pretty  good

now  let  me  zoom  out  im  going  to  come

over  here  now  to  where  it  says  view  let

me  toggle  off  the  guide  so  we  can  see

how  it  looks

and  as  you  can  see  our  design  is  looking

pretty  good  now  you  can  use  this  area

here  to  import  like  an  infographic  or  a

pie  chart  or  something  like  i  did  im

going  to  leave  it  blank  for  now

as  it  stands  this  design  is  looking  like

its  finished  so  what  im  going  to  do  is

im  going  to  save  it  as  a  pdf  document

ill  go  to  file

save  as  im  just  going  to  title  this

thing

report  and  for  the  file

save  save  as  type  im  going  to  change

that  to  pdf

right  there  there  we  go  and  ill  go

ahead  and  save

you  leave  the  defaults  as  they  are  go

ahead  and  click  ok

ok  now  the  downside  of  one  of  the  other

downsides  of  doing  this  with  inkscape  is

that  youll  have  to  design

your  report  or  your  book  one  page  at  a

time

and  then  save  all  of  the  individual

pages  as  individual  pdfs

and  then  use  something  like  pdf  sam  to

merge  the  pdf  document  together  ill

show  you  that  in  just  a  minute

again  this  is  one  of  the  downsides  of

using  inkscape  thats  why  i  recommend  if

youre  creating  something  really  long

like  a  50  or  60  page  book

probably  not  a  good  idea  to  use  inkscape

but  if  you  just  want  to  create  a  one  or

two  page  report  like  this

thats  fine  so  let  me  um  let  me  uh

minimize  this  now  let  me  come  back  over

here  to  my  folder  im  looking  for

report.pdf  what  im  going to  do  is  were

going  to  save  a  second  copy  of  this

file  save  as  im  going  to  save  a  second

a  second  copy  of  this  just  so  i  can

demonstrate  how  this  works

report  to

pdf  click  save

so  now  what  ive  done  here  is  i  opened

up  a  piece  of  software  known  as  pdf  sam

this  is  a  free  piece  of  software  ill

have  a  link  in  the  description  if  you

want  to  download  it  this  just  allows  you

to  merge  pdf  documents  together  pretty

quickly

if  you  want  you  can  use  a  web-based

solution  if  youd  like  you  dont  have  to

download  software  to  do  this

come  over  here  to  where  it  says  merge

and  im  going  to  take  these  two

documents  and  place  them  in  here  like

this  and  its  going  to  ask  you  where  you

want  to  place  this  im  going  to  place  it

where  it  originally  was

and  im  going  to  leave  everything  as  it

is  and  click  run

and  there  we  go  so  let  me  open  up  this

document

and  as  you  can  see  here  we  have  a

two-page  pdf  document  that  we  created

with  inkscape  and  you  can  take  this  text

and  highlight  it  and  copy  and  paste  it

just  like  you  would  with  any  other  pdf

document

and  the  great  thing  about  this  again  is

since  we  created  this  in  inkscape  this

is  a  vector

design  meaning  you  can  zoom  in  on  this

and  you  wont  get  that  pixelization  you

get  that

the  benefit  of  working  with  vectors  like

that  so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for

this  tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go

about  using  inkscape

for  some  pretty  rudimentary  desktop

publishing  purposes
