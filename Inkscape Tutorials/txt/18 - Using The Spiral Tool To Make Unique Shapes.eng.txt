in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  an

example  of  what  can  be  created  using  the

spiral  tool  in  inkscape  and  to  show  you

what  I  mean  I  have  this  simple  spiral

path  that  I  started  off  with  and  I  was

able  to  use  it  to  construct  this  rolled

sheet  of  paper  icon  that  you  could  see

here  and  I  will  be  demonstrating  how  to

create  this  entire  thing  so  let  me  come

over  here  into  a  new  document  and  we

will  get  started  so  the  first  thing  Im

going  to  do  is  grab  my  spiral  tool  which

is  located  over  here  and  the  tool

settings  I  want  to  use  I  already  have

inputed  into  my  input  boxes  here  so  go

ahead  and  pause  the  video  and  type  in

these  values  into  each  of  these  three

boxes  here  we  want  2.9  2.0  and

0.550  and  once  you  do  that  youll  be

good  to  get  started  so  now  what  I  will

do  is  I  will  hold  the  control  key  and

click  and  drag  to  the  right  to  create  a

spiral  and  the  way  that  I  want  this

spiral  positioned  I  want  the  tail  of  the

Spiral  on  the  right  hand  side  I  want

that  to  rest  on  the  horizontal  plane  so

that  its  going  up  vertically  like  that

we  dont  want  it  offc  Center  like  that

we  want  it  placed  just  like  that  and

thats  the  result  were  looking  for  and

now  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a  path

so  Ill  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

path  and  I  will  go  to  object  to  path  and

Im  going  to  grab  my  selection  tool  and

Im  going  to  flip  this  vertically  by

pressing  this  button  right  here  that

says  flip  uh  object  vertically  or  you

could  just  press  the  letter  V  on  your

keyboard  and  that  works  as  well  and  Im

going  to  zoom  in  on  this  and  Im  going

to  click  on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles  Im  going  to  rotate  this  around

a  little  bit  just  so  that  this  tail

right  here  is  not  too  far  up  we  dont

want  that  too  far  up  like  that  we  want

this  down  a  little  bit  and  that  looks  a

lot  better  so  what  Im  going  to  do  now

is  first  of  all  come  up  here  to  the  tool

settings  menu  if  you  hover  your  cursor

over  this  first  of  four  icons  right  here

itll  say  when  scaling  objects  scale  the

stroke  width  by  the  same  proportion  make

sure  you  have  that  turned  off  right  now

we  want  that  disabled  and  once  we  do

that  Im  going  to  come  back  over  here  to

my  object  click  on  it  again  to  get  back

to  my  scaling  handles  and  Im  going  to

take  this  bottom  Arrow  icon  right  here

and  just  scale  this  up  like  that  so  we

have  this  distorted  effect  as  you  can

see  here  and  once  weve  done  that  Im

just  going  to  click  on  it  again  Im

going  to  rotate  this  a  little  bit  more

Im  not  quite  happy  with  how  that  looks

all  right  that  looks  a  lot  better  and

now  Im  going  to  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  so  come  over  here  to  where

it  says  path  or  No  Object  and  go  to  fill

and  stroke  and  the  menu  should  open  up

over  here  on  your  right  hand  side  of

your  screen  Im  going  to  select  the

stroke  style  Tab  and  I  want  to  change

the  width  of  the  stroke  from  one  pixel

to  five  pixel

pixels  and  I  want  to  make  the  caps

rounded  as  well  and  then  I  want  to  come

down  here  and  bring  the  opacity  of  this

down  in  half  this  is  just  going  to  make

it  easier  for  us  to  see  what  were

working  with  as  we  move

forward  so  we  now  have  the  top  portion

design  so  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  right  click  this  and  go  to

duplicate  and  Im  going  to  hold  the

control  key  and  move  this  down  here  like

this  this  is  going  to  represent  the  top

of  the  roll  of  paper  and  this  is  going

to  represent  the  bottom  if  I  could  show

show  you  what  I  mean  here  this  is  the

shape  were  starting  off  with  and  this

is  what  were  putting  it  were  putting

it  down  there  like  that  and  now  what  I

will  do  is  let  me  click  off  of  that  to

deselect  it  Im  going  to  turn  on

snapping  Im  going  to  come  over  here  to

this  magnet  icon  and  enable  that  let  me

expand  this  menu  and  we  dont  want

advanced  mode  if  youre  in  advanced  mode

just  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

reset  to  simple  snapping  mode  and  the

two  options  we  want  enabled  in  simple

mode  are  bounding  boxes  and  nodes  and

were  going  to  keep  alignment  turned  off

so  now  Im  going  to  grab  my  bezier  pen

which  is  located  over  here  or  the  pen

tool  as  its  called  and  Im  going  to

come  over  here  and  Im  going  to  snap  to

the  left  side  of  this  spiral  and  let  me

zoom  out  Im  going  to  bring  the  line

straight  down  Im  going  to  hold  my

control  key  to  lock  it  onto  the  vertical

axis  and  then  snap  to  the  left  edge  of

the  other  shape  like  that  and  press

enter  and  now  we  want  to  give  this

stroke  the  same  style  so  let  me  change

this  to  five  pixels  and  Ill  make  these

caps  arounded  as  well  and  Ill  bring

down  the  opacity  of  that  in  half  and  you

can  see  why  Im  turning  down  the  opacity

I  want  to  be  able  to  see  where  this  line

lines  up  with  the  other  path  with  the

spiral  path  I  want  to  make  sure

everything  there  is  nice  and  lined  up

and  having  partial  opacity  makes  it  easy

to  see  through  these  objects  while  you

do  that  so  now  lets  create  another  line

going  over  here  lets  connect  this  top

part  to  this  bottom  part  over  here  Im

going  to  hold  control  bring  this

straight  down  and  then  snap  it  onto  the

path  right  there  and  press  enter  to

create  the  line  Im  going  to  make  the

width  five  pixels  make  the  Caps  rounded

and  bring  the  opacity  down  in  half  like

that  and  now  we  have  the  right  side  in

place  okay  so  Ill  just  zoom  in  to  make

sure  everything  looks  correct  here  we

want  this  nice  and  smooth  we  dont  want

anything  off

center  and  now  Im  going  to  do  the  same

thing  over  here  let  me  snap  to  this

piece  bring  this  straight  down  by

holding  the  control  key  snap  to  the

bottom  part  click  again  and  press  enter

Im  going  to  make  this  five

pixels  make  the  caps  rounded  bring  the

opacity  down  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  Ill  snap  to  the  right  Edge

bring  the  line  straight  down  by  holding

control  there  we  go  let  me  change  the

style  of  this  one  as

well  and  its  starting  to  come  together

as  you  can  see  we  now  have  to  get  rid  of

this  bottom  piece  down  here  so  uh

theres  various  ways  we  can  get  rid  of

this  bottom  piece  down  here  the  way  that

Im  going  to  do  this  is  Im  going  to

grab  my  select  tool  Im  going  to  enable

the  ruler  on  my  canvas  by  pressing

controlr  on  the  keyboard  if  youre  using

Mac  it  would  be  command  R  so  Im  going

to  press  command  R  and  now  we  have  the

ruler  and  Im  going  to  come  up  here  to

the  horizontal  ruler  and  click  and  drag

to  pull  a  guide  down  and  Im  going  to

snap  that  guide  right  where  the  end

point  of  this  vertical  line  is  and  now

Im  going  to  select  this  path  right  here

and  I  will  grab  my  nodes  tool  and  I  will

double  click  right  there  to  add  a  new

node  and  Ill  make  sure  that  Noe  is

selected  and  I  want  to  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  uh  not  join  selected  we

want  this  one  right  here  break  path  at

selected  nodes  and  thats  going  to  break

that  up  into  separate

pieces  and  now  Im  going  to  grab  my

select  tool  Ill  go  to  path  and  I  will

select  break

apart  deselect  it  by  clicking  off  onto

the  canvas  and  Im  going  to  take  this

piece  and  just  press  delete  to  get  rid

of  it  and  then  I  will  get  rid  of  the

guide  Ill  press  Ill  click  on  the  guide

hover  the  cursor  over  it  until  it

highlights  red  press  the  delete  key  to

get  rid  of  the  guide  and  now  I  will  get

rid  of  the  ruler  as  well  by  holding  uh

command  and  pressing  r  or  controlr  if

youre  on  Windows  or  Linux  so  a  lot  of

this  is  in  place  now  all  we  have  to  do

now  is  create  these  lines  of  text  or

what  are  supposed  to  be  lines  of  text

and  then  well  fill  this  in  with  some

color  so  let  me  uh  let  me  click  on  this

object  up  here  the  original  spiral  path

Im  going  to  right  click  that  and  go  to

duplicate  and  Ill  hold  control  and

bring  this  straight  down  like  this  lets

turn  off  snapping  now  we  dont  need  that

anymore  and  I  just  want  to  I  just  want

to  take  this  segment  right  here  and  use

it  that  so  let  me  grab  the  rectangle

tool  and  Ill  click  and  drag  and  create

a  rectangle  over  that  portion  of  the

Spiral  right  there  we  just  want  to  take

this  selection  and  then  Ill  select  both

of  those  and  I  will  go  to  path  and

select  cut  path  and  that  should  break  it

up  into  separate  pieces  and  now  we  can

just  take  this  piece  right  here  and  get

rid  of  that  and  get  rid  of  this  piece

right  here  as  well  and  let  me  move  this

up  Im  going  to  hold  control  while  doing

this  so  that  we  lock  it  onto  the

vertical  axis  and  Im  going  to  duplicate

this  instead  of  right  clicking  and  going

to  duplicate  Im  just  going  to  press

contrl  D  or  command  D  if  youre  on  Mac

and  then  Ill  take  this  duplicate  copy

and  move  that  down  and  Im  going  to

repeat  this  Im  going  to  select  both  of

these  control  D  to  duplicate  bring  them

down  here  and  Ill  do  this  maybe  one

more  time  bring  these  ones  down

here  and  now  we  want  to  make  sure  that

these  lines  are  evenly  spaced  so  let  me

select  all  of  them  and  I  will  open  up  my

aligned  distribute  menu  you  can  access

that  by  going  to  object  and  selecting

aligned  distribute  I  already  have  mine

open  over  here  in  my  dock  dockable  menu

so  Ill  just  click  on  that  and  the

option  Im  looking  for  over  here  where

it  says  distribute  we  want  to  choose

this  option  right  here  that  says  even

vertical  gaps  and  when  I  click  on

that  it  makes  everything  spaced  apart

evenly  and  what  we  could  do  now  is  Im

just  going  to  adjust  this  a  little  bit

what  we  could  do  now  is  we  can  combine

all  of  these  Strokes  together  so  that

this  becomes  one  shape  so  Im  going  to

select  everything  and  I  will  go  to  path

and  select  combine

and  once  you  do  that  you  can  come  back

over  to  your  fill  and  stroke  menu  and  we

can  bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up  and

if  you  want  you  can  make  the  stroke

larger  another  way  that  you  can  make  the

stroke  larger  is  that  you  can  just  scale

this  down  Im  going  to  hold  control  and

scale  this  down  and  since  we  have  this

setting  disabled  as  we  scale  the  object

the  stroke  size  will  stay  the  same  so  if

you  want  a  heavier  stroke  you  can  scale

this  down  like  that  and  you  could  see

the  result  as  its  happening  and  once

youre  happy  with  the  thickness  of  the

stroke  lets  enable  this  setting  again

so  so  that  now  we  can  enlarge  this

object  without  losing  those

proportions  and  Im  actually  going  to

adjust  that  a  little  bit  I  dont  want  it

that

heavy  okay  that  looks  a  little  better  so

all  thats  left  now  is  to  color  this

thing  in  so  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  a

little  bit  and  Im  going  to  come  over

here  to  my  stroke  paint  Tab  and  Im

going  to  give  this  a  dark  blue  color

Ill  come  over  here  to  the  original

design  you  can  see  how  I  colored  it  here

this  is  Im  going  to  go  for  something

similar  right  here  I  mean  obviously  you

can  color  this  however  youd  like  Im

just  going  to  go  with  this  blue  theme

Ill  make  this  a  little

darker  and  I  want  to  fill  in  these  empty

areas  here  using  the  paint  bucket  tool

so  let  me  grab  the  paint  bucket  tool  and

Im  going  to  click  on  this  area  right

here  to  fill  it  in  and  Im  going  to

change  that  color  to  something  else  oops

that  was  the  wrong  thing  let  me  press

control  Z  I  want  to  choose  the  fill  tab

not  the  stroke  paint  tab  there  we  go  let

me  make  this  a  different

color  Ill  go  with  a  lighter  shade  of

blue  and  Ill  come  over  here  and  fill

this  in  as  well  Ill  make  this  a

I  dont  know  why  its  applying  a  stroke

let  me  get  rid  of  that  there  we  go  Ill

take  this  and  Ill  make  this  one  a

little

darker  maybe  Ill  put  a  little  more  blue

in

there  and  then  Ill  do  this  one  more

time  Ill  fill  that  one  in  and  Ill  make

this  one  the  darkest  of  them  all  so  let

me  make  it  a  little

darker  and  Im  actually  going  to  make

this  stroke  a  little  darker  as  well  to

accommodate  these  uh  other  colors  and

once  thats  done  we  want  to  raise  this

to  the  top  so  Im  going  to  press  this

button  over  here  that  says  raise  to  the

top  we  want  that  we  want  the  stroke

object  on  top  of  everything  else  on  top

of  the  fill  objects  and  we  could  zoom

out  and  you  can  see  we  are  finished  so

thats  an  example  of  what  you  can  do

using  the  spiral  tool  in  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  how  I  did  in  this  video

we  even  have  a  private  Community  where

you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from
