one  of  the  greatest  advantages  that

comes  with  using  inkscape  is  having  the

ability  to  create  repeat  patterns  from

simple  shapes  objects  and  even  groups  of

objects  in  fact  not  only  can  you  use

vector  objects  to  create  patterns  in

inkscape  you  can  even  use  text  objects

clipped  objects  and  even  jpeg  images  in

this  tutorial  well  be  showing  you

exactly  how

so  getting  us  started  here  inkscape

makes  the  process  of  turning  an  object

into  a  pattern  incredibly  easy  let  me

show  you  what  i  mean  using  a  simple

shape  just  to  get  us  started  and  then

ill  show  you  a  working  example  of  how

you  can  actually  use  this  in  a  practical

sense

so  im  going  to  start  off  with  a  star

im  going  to use  the  stars  and  polygons

tool  im  going  to  choose  star  instead  of

polygon  and  im  going  to  use  these  input

settings  right  here  in  case  youd  like

to  follow  along  with  what  im  doing

now  im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  on

the  canvas  to  create  my  star  im  going

to  move  the  cursor  up  like  that  and  im

going  to  hold  ctrl  and  ctrl  and  shift  so

that  we  have  a  nice  upright  star  like

that

now  im  going  to  make  this  green  just  to

have  a  different  color  grab  the

selection  tool  and  let  me  scale  this

down  a little  bit  im  going to  hold  ctrl

to  lock  the  proportions  and  scale  that

down  like  that

and  now  to  turn  this  object  into  a

pattern  all  you  have  to  do  is  make  sure

you  have  it  selected  and  go  to  object

pattern  and  select  object  to  pattern

okay  now  nothing  visibly  changes  on  your

canvas  but  that  object  will  now  be

registered  as  a  pattern  in  your  fill  and

stroke  menu  so  let  me  show  you  how  you

can  apply  it  now  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool  im  going  to  click  and

drag  on  the  canvas  to  create  a  simple

rectangle  like  that

just  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  im

going  to  convert  this  to  a  path  so  ill

go  to  path  and  select  object  to  path

and  now  i  want  to  change  the  fill

property  of  this  rectangle  from  a  solid

color  to  a  pattern  so  to  do  that  were

going to  use  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

which  is  located  over  here

and  what  we  are  looking  for  is  under  the

fill  tab  we  have  all  of  these  different

options  for  filling  our  object  were

looking  for  this  option  right  here  that

says  pattern  when  you  hover  your  cursor

over  it  im  going  to  click  on  that

and  if  you  use  this  drop  down  right  here

you  should  see  a  list  of  all  the

different  patterns  that  inkscape  has  in

it  already  now  the  patterns  that  you

create  custom  made  patterns  are  going  to

be  labeled  as  pattern  with  a  series  of

random  numbers  after  it  i  dont  know  why

this  is  the  case  uh  but  for  whatever

reason  inkscape  will  name  your  patterns

this  and  as  far  as  i  know  there  is  no

way  to  change  the  name  of  these  patterns

so  look  for  something  titled  pattern

3786  or  whatever  your  numbers  will  be

and  select  that

and  uh  the  the  pattern  is  actually

applied  there  you  cant  really  see  it

though  because  it  needs  to  be  scaled

down  so  to  scale  this  down  lets  work  on

editing  our  pattern

im  going  to  grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes

tool  over  here

and  what  we  are  looking  for  is  were

looking  for  these  handles  the  first

handle  were  looking  for  is  right  here

this  little  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  this

little  crosshair  this  x  represents  the

location  of  the  pattern  relative  to  your

object

now  if  i  want  to  move  the  location  of

the  pattern  i  could  just  click  and  drag

this  x  like  this  to  move  the  pattern

within  the  object  like  that  you  probably

couldnt  see  exactly  what  happened  there

because  the  patterns  too  large  i  have

to  scale  it  down  so  lets  do  that  let  me

zoom  out  a little  bit  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  roll  down  the  mouse  wheel  a

couple  of  times

and  im  looking  for  some  more  handles

out  here  i  dont  know  why  but  for  some

reason  inkscape  puts  these  handles  all

the  way  out  here  in  space  sometimes  so

youll  have  to  look  around  for  them  and

theyre  tiny  too  theyre  hard  to  see  so

were  looking  for  this  square  handle

right  here  which  represents  the  size  of

the  pattern

and  then  were  looking  for  this  circular

handle  right  here  which  represents  the

rotation  of  the  pattern

so  let  me  take  the  square  handle  over

here  and  scale  this  pattern  down  im

going  to  hold  ctrl

while  im  doing  this  im  bringing  the

square  handle  towards  the  center  point

that  crosshair  that  x  and  as  i  do  this

im  holding  ctrl  to  lock  the  aspect

ratio  and  as  you  can  see  the  pattern  is

getting  smaller  and  were  seeing  more  of

those  stars  in  there  let  me  zoom  in  on

this  so  you  can  see  this  better

this  scaling  handle

allows  you  to

resize  your  pattern  as  needed  as  you  can

see  here  and  if  you  want  to  rotate  your

pattern  you  can  use  this  handle  right

here

holding  control  will  lock  the  rotation

onto  15  degree  angles  the  same  as  it

would  with  any  other  transformation  that

you  would  make  in  inkscape  and  again  if

you  want  to  move  the  location  of  the

pattern  you  just  have  to  click  and  drag

this  crosshair  like  that  and  move  this

around  as  you  can  see  here

and  there  you  go  that  is  how  you  could

take  an  object  and  turn  it  into  a  simple

pattern

so  lets  go  over  a  working  example  of

how  you  would  actually  use  this  feature

to  create  a  pattern  design

for  an  example  here  i  have  this  simple

avocado  graphic  that  i  created  im  just

going  to  click  and  drag  over  everything

here  and  group  all  of  these  shapes

together  by  going  to  object

and  selecting

group  now  the  good  thing  about  working

with  patterns  in  inkscape  is  that  it

allows  you  to  create  patterns  from

virtually  anything  it  doesnt  just  have

to  be  a  single  shape  or  a  single  object

it  could  be  a  grouping  of  objects  it

could  be  a  text  object  it  could  be  a

masked  or  a  clipped  object  it  could  even

be  a  jpeg  image  so  virtually  anything

you  want  in  inkscape  can  be  turned  into

a  pattern  okay  so  im  going  to  turn  this

group  of  vector  objects  into  a  pattern

now  when  i  create  my  pattern  i  dont

want  all  of  the  copies  of  this  graphic

to  be  touching  each  other  side  by  side

as  you  can  see  here  by  the  bounding  box

what  i  want  to  do  is  increase  the  size

of  that  bounding  box  so  that  these

objects  have  some  spacing  between  them

as  they  repeat  in  the  pattern  so  what

im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to  copy

this  object  im  going  to  right  click  it

and  go  to  copy

and  im  going  to  create  a  rectangle

like  that

and  i  want  to  make  this  rectangle  the

same  size  as  my  object  im  going  to  go

to  edit

paste  size  and  im  going  to  choose  paste

size

grab  the  selection  tool  lower  this

beneath  the  object  click  and  drag  over

both  of  these  so  we  have  them  both

selected  and  im  going  to  center  this  up

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis

using  the  alignment  menu  which  is

located  over  here

it  should  open  up  on  the  right  hand  side

of  your  screen  and  i  want  last  selected

chosen  from  this  drop  down  and  im  just

going  to  align  this  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  like  that

okay  so  now  im  going  to  click  off  of

this  to  deselect  everything  what  i  want

to  do  now  is  take  this  object  and  add

some  padding  around  it  so  that  we  have

some  spacing  going  around  this  avocado

graphic

so  what  im  going  to  do  up  here  where  it

says  the  width  328  im  just  going  to  add

100  to  each  dimension  so  im  going  to

make  this

uh  400

and  im  going  to  make  this  over  here  the

height

500

and  now  we  have  a  little  bit  of  padding

there  let  me  center  that  up  center  that

up  let  me  see  how  that  looks  okay  we

have  some  more  pattern  but  maybe  not  as

much  as  id  like  im  going  to  add

another  100  to  each  dimension  so  let  me

make  this  500

and  then  ill  make  this  one  600

and  let  me  try  that  again  let  me  center

that  up

okay  that  looks  a  little  better

so  now  im  going  to  grop  im  going  to

group  these  two  objects  together  ill  go

to  object  and  select

group

and  im  just  going  to  scale  this  down

and  put  this  off  to  the  side

im  going  to  select  this  make  sure  i

have  it  selected  go  to  object

pattern

objects  to  pattern  and  lets  say  i  want

to  use  this  as  a  background  for  like  a

thumbnail  im  going  to  design  the

average  thumbnail  design  is  1280  by  720

pixels  so  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool

click  and  drag  like  that  and  let  me  grab

my  selection  tool  and  im  going  to

change  the  width  and  height  of  this  to

1280

by  720  like  that  and  i  want  to  resize  my

canvas  to  fit  this  object  so  im  going

to  select  the  object  and  press  ctrl

shift  and  r  on  the  keyboard  and  itll

resize  the  document  to  fit  that  object

now  im  going  to  take  this  object  right

here

go  back  to  the  fill  and  stroke  menu  and

im  going  to  choose  my  pattern  and  as

you  can  see  theres  the  pattern  so  what

i  want  to  do  is  grab  the  edit  paths  by

nodes  tool

and  look  for  the  placement  put  that  in

the  center

look  for  the  scaling  handle  scale  that

down

oops

there  we  go

and  as  you  can  see  we  have  our  avocado

pattern  that  we  created

using  inkscape  and  i  could  even  rotate

this  around  a little  bit  just  to  give  it

a  little  bit  of  a

design  flare  there  we  go

okay  you  got  to  make  sure  youre

grabbing  the  correct  cross  hair  here

there  we  go

and  there  we  go  that  is  how  you  could

take  a  simple  object  and  turn  it  into  a

repeat  pattern  that  you  can  use  to  fill

objects  however  youd  like  in  inkscape

before  i  end  this  video  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  i  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  i  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  life  ill

have  some  information  about  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  as  always  thanks  for
