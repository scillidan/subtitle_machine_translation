so  lets  go  over  how  you  can  change  the

perspective  of  an  object  using  inkscape

for  this  demonstration  Ill  be  using  a

text  object  so  Im  going  to  grab  my  text

tool  and  Im  going  to click  on  the

canvas  and  Im  just  going  to  use  the

word  perspective  for  this  demonstration

and  then  Im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  and  Im  going  to  make  this  a  little

bit  bigger  so  you  can  see  it  better

now  what  we  want  to  do  is  open  up  our

pathfx  menu  so  Ill  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  path  and  I  will  select

pathfx

now  in  order  for  this  function  to  work

the  object  that  were  applying  it  to  has

to  be  a  path  right  now  this  is  just  a

text  object  so  lets  convert  this  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  object  to  path  and

once  youve  done  that  you  should  be  able

to  click  on  this  little  plus  icon  down

here  in  the  menu  to  add  a  new  path

effect  and  the  path  effect  that  were

looking  for  is  called  perspective

envelope  which  is  located  right  there  if

youre  having  trouble  accessing  it  you

could  just  type  it  into  the  search  bar

up  here  per  s  and  there  it  is

perspective  envelope

and  now  all  you  have  to  do  is  grab  your

edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  and  if  you  look

in  the  corners  over  here  you  will  see

these  four  white  nodes  and  you  can  take

these  nodes  and  use  it  to  change  the

perspective  of  your  object  just  like

that

now  if  you  want  to  lock  the  perspective

onto  a  certain  axis  you  can  use  these

settings  over  here  in  the  pathfx  menu  so

if  I  select  mirror  movements  in  on  the

horizontal  axis  itll  make  it  so  that

the  perspective  only  changes  relative  to

the  horizontal  axis  like  that  as  you  can

see  there  and  likewise  if  you  use

vertical  itll  lock  the  perspective

change  onto  the  vertical  axis  like  that

and  once  you  are  finished  you  can

finalize  the  changes  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  and  you  are  done  that  is

how  you  can  change  the  perspective  of  an

object  using  inkscape  if  you  found  this

lesson  useful  then  consider  checking  out

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime
