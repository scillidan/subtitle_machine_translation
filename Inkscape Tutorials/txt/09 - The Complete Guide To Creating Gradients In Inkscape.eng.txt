in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over

everything  you  need  to  know  about

working  with  gradients  in  inkscape  now

in  this  lesson  were  going  to  focus  on

linear  and  Radial  gradients  in

particular  but  if  you  want  to  learn

about  some  of  the  more  advanced  types  of

gradients  in  inkscape  such  as  mesh

gradients  and  conical  gradients  I  have  a

separate  tutorial  for  that  that  Ill

have  Linked  In  the  description  below  so

to  start  us  off  here  a  gradient  is

basically  a  transition  between  two  or

more  colors  and  a  good  example  of  that

would  be  the  sunset  graphic  in  the

background  this  sky  does  not  have  a

single  color  applied  to  it  it  has  a

gradient  applied  to  it  where  it

transitions  from  lavender  to  this  Peach

sort  of  shade  so  let  me  show  you  how

this  can  be  accomplished  in  inkscape  Im

going  to  grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  to

draw  a  rectangle  and  then  Im  going  to

open  up  my  fill  and  stroke  menu  by

coming  down  here  to  this  color  stripe

and  double  clicking

it  when  I  do  that  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  will  open  up  over  here  on  the  right

hand  side  of  the  screen  and  Under  The

Fill  tab  youll  notice  we  have  have

these  different  types  of  fills  that  we

can  apply  to  an  object  right  now  we  have

a  solid  color  applied  to  the  object  but

if  we  wanted  to  apply  a  a  gradient  we

can  choose  one  of  these  options  over

here  we  have  a  linear  gradient  which

follows  a  linear  or  straight  path  and

then  we  have  a  radial  gradient  which

follows  a  circular  or  round  path  so  let

me  select  linear  gradient  and  when  I  do

that  you  can  see  that  by  default  the

gradient  that  it  applies  starts  off  with

the  original  color  on  the  left  hand  side

and  then  it  transitions  over  to

transparency  on  the  right  hand  side  now

Im  going  to  grab  my  gradient  tool  from

the  toolbar  over  here  you  can  also

access  it  by  pressing  the  letter  G  on

your  keyboard  and  if  I  click  on  this

handle  you  can  see  the  color  thats

applied  to  this  part  of  the  gradient

over  here  in  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

you  can  see  the  color  code  you  can  see

the  hsl  values  and  then  you  can  see  the

colors  indexed  over  here  in  the  stops

menu  now  if  I  click  on  the  other  end  of

this  gradient  you  can  see  now  I  have  the

other  color  selected  now  this  is  the

same  color  but  the  alpha  channel  is

brought  all  the  way  down  and  by  the  way

if  you  dont  have  an  alpha  channel  here

make  sure  to  come  up  here  to  this  drop

down  and  choose  hsl  from  this  list  now

Im  going  to  bring  the  opacity  of  this

end  of  the  gradient  all  the  way  up  so

Im  going  to  change  the  alpha  channel  to

100  and  Ill  press  enter  and  Im  going

to  give  this  a  different  color  so  Im

going  to  click  on  this  side  of  the

gradient  to  select  it  and  Ill  choose  a

different  color  from  my  color  palette

down  here  now  by  the  way  you  dont  have

have  to  use  the  color  palette  if  you

want  you  can  change  the  color  using  the

color  wheel  or  the  hsl

sliders  and  once  youve  chosen  your

colors  you  can  take  these  ends  of  the

gradients  and  move  them  around  if  youd

like  you  could  just  click  and  drag  them

like  that  and  you  can  move  them  as  if

they  were  any  other  object  in  fact  if

you  hold  the  control  key  itll  lock  it

onto  15  Dee  increments  so  that  you  can

get  a  perfectly  straight  gradient  that

either  goes  vertically  or

horizontally  so  let  me  move  this  back

over  a  little

bit  now  if  you  come  up  here  to  the  top

top  of  the  menu  you  can  see  we  have  some

controls  in  here  lets  say  I  wanted  to

reverse  this  gradient  I  can  click  on

that  button  and  it  flips  the  gradient

around  so  that  yellow  is  on  the  left

hand  side  and  pink  is  on  the  right  and

Im  going  to  flip  it  back  and  it  gets

the  same  effect  and  then  over  here  we

have  repeat  as  of  right  now  there  is  no

repeat  applied  to  this  gradient  so  the

default  is  none  but  if  I  were  to  change

this  to  a  direct  repeat  you  can  see  what

happens  here  when  the  gradient  ends  it

just  starts  and  stops  abruptly  and  opens

up  a  new  one  and  this  goes

infinitely  so  let  me  put  this  back  and

then  the  other  option  is  reflected  so

Ill  choose  reflected  and  this  repeats

the  gradient  as  well  but  it  just  mirrors

it  each  time  so  its  a  little  bit  of  a

softer  transition  so  let  me  set  this

back  to  none  Im  going  to  move  my  stops

out  a  little  bit  and  lets  say  I  wanted

to  add  a  new  color  to  this  gradient  to

do  that  all  I  have  to  do  is  doubleclick

anywhere  on  the  path  with  the  gradient

tool  so  Ill  double  click  right  here  and

itll  add  a  new  stop  to  that  gradient

and  if  you  look  over  here  in  your  stops

index  you  can  see  all  of  the  colors  that

are  included  in  this  gradient  and  we  now

have  that  one  in  the  middle  that  was

just  added  and  if  you  click  on  that  one

to  select  it  you  can  change  the  color  of

that  as  well  so  Ill  make  this  something

radically  different  like  green  just  to

show  you  and  you  can  see  we  now  have  a

gradient  that  transitions  from  pink  to

Green  to  yellow  and  I  could  take  these

stops  and  move  them  around  as  needed  and

this  works  infinitely  you  can  keep

adding  new  stops  in  here  if  you  want  to

to  add  new  parts  to  the

gradient  and  if  you  want  to  remove  them

all  you  have  to  do  is  just  press  the

delete  key  so  Ill  press  delete  to

delete  that  one  Ill  click  on  that  one

to  select  it  press  delete  and  then  Ill

do  the  same  thing  over  here  and  then

were  back  to  our  original  gradient  and

by  the  way  it  works  the  same  thing  over

here  in  this  menu  you  can  select  these

stops  just  by  clicking  on  these  colors

in  the  stops  index  and  another  thing  you

can  do  is  if  you  want  to  offset  your

gradient  so  that  one  color  is  more

dominant  than  the  other  you  can  use  this

slider  up  here  so  lets  say  I  wanted

more  pink  in  this  gradient  I  could  take

this  slider  and  just  bring  this  over  and

then  it  becomes  more  pink  dominant  and

it  works  the  other  way  in  Reverse  as

well  I  can  take  the  yellow  slider  and

bring  that

over  and  there  you  go  now  theres  more

yellow  in  the

gradient  so  now  lets  have  a  look  at  an

example  of  when  linear  gradients  would

come  in  handy  getting  back  to  my

original  example  of  the  sunset  right  now

the  sky  just  has  a  single  color  applied

to  it  but  if  I  wanted  to  make  this  look

more  like  a  realistic  Sunset  I  would

apply  a  linear  gradient  to  it  so  Im

going  to  click  on  the  object  to  select

it  and  then  Ill  open  up  my  fill  and

stroke  menu  Ill  apply  a  linear  gradient

and  Im  going  to  grab  my  gradients  tool

and  Im  going  to  select  this  end  of  the

gradient  and  instead  of  letting  this  be

transparent  Im  going  to  make  this  a

purple  shade  so  another  way  that  you  can

apply  colors  to  your  gradient  is  with

the  dropper  tool  so  with  this  end  of  the

gradient  selected  I  will  press  D  on  my

keyboard  to  grab  my  color  selector  and

then  Im  going  to  sample  this  color

right  here  just  to  make  it  that  shade  of

purple

and  then  Ill  grab  my  gradient  tool  and

Ill  take  this  stop  and  bring  this  up

here  and  then  Ill  take  this  one  and

bring  this  down  and  again  holding

control  on  my  keyboard  so  that  it

remains  a  perfectly  vertical  path  and

there  you  go  just  like  that  I  was  able

to  use  linear  gradients  to  make  this

Sunset  look  more

realistic  now  lets  have  a  look  at  how

radial  gradients  work  Im  going  to  grab

my  circles  and  ellipses  tool  and  Ill

hold  control  and  click  and  drag  to

create  a  circle  and  now  Im  going  to

apply  a  gradient  to  it  but  instead  of

using  a  linear  gradient  this  time  Im

going  to  use  a  radial  gradient  and  when

I  click  on  that  you  can  see  what  happens

here  uh  if  I  grab  my  gradient  tool  you

can  see  that  this  works  almost  the  same

way  but  the  only  difference  is  that  the

gradient  is  now  following  a  round  path

instead  of  a  linear  path  and  I  could

take  these  handles  and  bring  them  in

like  this  and  if  I  do  that  you  can  see

it  distorts  the  gradient  but  if  I  want

to  maintain  the  aspect  ratio  while

scaling  what  I  would  do  is  I  would  hold

the  control  key  or  control  and  shift

rather  and  it  scales  both  at  the  same

time  time  let  me  try  that  again  though

since  I  already  distorted  it  the  key  is

that  you  want  to  hold  control  and  shift

before  you  click  and  drag  so  Ill  hold

control  and  shift  and  then  Ill  click

and  drag  and  now  it  scales  it  with  the

aspect  ratio

preserved  and  again  this  works  the  same

way  if  you  want  to  add  new  colors  in

here  you  could  just  double  click  the

path  and  with  that  node  selected  you  can

click  on  a  different  color  and  then  it

adds  that  color  to  the

gradient  so  let  me  undo  that  let  me  undo

adding  the  new  stop  to  the  gradient  and

Im  going  to  reverse  this  gradient  up

here  Im  going  to  click  on  this  option

that  says  reverse  the  direction  of  the

gradient  and  Im  going  to  select  this

option  in  the  middle  and  Im  going  to

bring  the  alpha  Channel  up  to

100  and  Ill  make  this  one  white  so  Ill

bring  this  up  to  100  as  well  so  that

its  all  white  and  then  Ill  take  this

end  of  the  gradient  and  Ill  move  this

up  into  the  right  like

that  and  then  Ill  change  the  offset  of

this  gradient  by  adding  more  white  to  it

so  Ill  take  this  handle  and  bring  this

out  a  little

bit

and  Ill  scale  this  out  some  more  Im

going  to  hold  control  and  shift  and

scale

up  and  as  you  can  see  we  were  able  to

use  the  radial  gradients  to  create  this

simulated  uh  I  guess  you  can  say  it  sort

of  looks  like  a  sphere  or  like  a

three-dimensional  round

object  so  now  lets  go  over  an  example

of  when  radial  gradients  come  in  handy

Im  going  to  use  radial  gradients  to

create  a  vignette  effect  over  this

graphic  here  so  let  me  grab  my  rectangle

tool  and  Ill  click  and  drag  over  the

graphic  to  draw  a  rectangle  that  covers

the  graphic  entirely  and  let  me  get  rid

of  that  Stroke  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  the  X  and  Im  going  to  make

this  all  white  and  now  Im  going  to

apply  a  radial  gradient  to  it  Im  going

to  reverse  the  gradient  so  that

transparency  is  on  the  inside  and  white

is  on  the  outside  and  then  Ill  scale

the  gradient  down  so  that  the  boundaries

of  it  stay  or  the  ends  of  it  stay  within

the  boundary  of  the

image  and  now  Im  going  to  add  more  to

the  Im  going  to  set  an  offset  favoring

the  transparent  side  of  the  gradient  so

Ill  bring  that  up  a  little  bit  so  that

you  can  see  more  of  the  image  and  if  I

zoom  out  you  can  see  what  we  were  able

to  accomplish  with  that  there  we  created

this  vignette  effect  where  it  looks  like

the  edges  of  the  graphic  have  been

softened  and  faded  out  so  that  is  how

you  can  go  about  working  with  linear  and

Radial  gradients  in  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

$17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as
