this  is  Nick  of  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  todays  tutorial  Ill  be

demonstrating  how  you  can  crop  a  photo

using  Inkscape  and  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  Inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  the  Inkscape  master

class  which  is  a  collection  of  over  50

videos  where  I  go  over  every  single  tool

and  feature  in  Inkscape  and  I  explain

what  it  is  and  demonstrate  how  it  works

Ill  put  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  started  here  Im  going  to  open

up  Inkscape  the  first  thing  we  want  to

do  is  just  make  sure  that  we  set  up  our

documents  that  were  all  working  with

this  similar  setup  Im  gonna  come  up

here  to  where  it  says  view  were  gonna

want  custom  selected  and  then  Im  going

to  go  to  zoom  going  to  zoom  in  at  1  to  1

and  then  I  want  to  open  up  the  the  edit

objects  colors  gradients  and  Stroke  menu

with  this  button  up  here  or  you  could

just  press  control  shift  F  as  a  keyboard

shortcut  and  what  I  want  to  do  now  is

import  my  photo  into  Inkscape  you  can  do

that  by  going  to  file  import  and

navigating  to  the  file  on  your  hard

drive  where  the  photo  is  located  what  I

like  to  do  is  I  like  to  just  grab  a

folder  like  this  and  just  click  and  drag

it  into  Inkscape  like  that  and  Im  just

gonna  choose  M  bed  if  it  asks  you  if  you

want  to  embed  it  or  link  it  I  just  like

to  go  with  embed  and  there  we  go  theres

the  photo  Im  gonna  be  cropping  let  me

zoom  out  a  little  bit  Im  gonna  hold

ctrl  and  roll  down  the  mouse  wheel  to

zoom  out  a  little  bit  what  Im  gonna  be

doing  here  is  removing  the  subject  from

the  background  here  now  before  we  get

started  I  just  have  to  mention  that  this

is  the  sort  of  thing  that  would  be

better  suited  for  an  application  like

inkscape  isnt  really  designed  for

working  with  photos  like  this  its  more

for  vector  design  but  if  you  dont  feel

like  downloading  if  youre  not  a

user  and  you  dont  feel  like  downloading

and  installing  and  learning  how  to

use  a  new  piece  of  software  this  can

absolutely  be  done  with  Inkscape  in  fact

i  do  this  with  Inkscape  all  the  time  so

just  wanted  to  throw  that  out  there

before  we  get  started  so  let  me  get

started  here  Im  gonna  zoom  in  a  little

bit  to  zoom  in  and  out  again  whos

holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  and  down  the

mouse  wheel  well  be  doing  that  a  lot

throughout  this  tutorial  well  also  be

moving  the  page  around  like  this  to  do

this  Im  pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel

and  moving  the  mouse  just  basic

navigation  tools  youre  gonna  have  to

keep  in  mind  while  working  on  this  Im

gonna  start  over  here  about  the  lower

right  edge  of  the  subject  Im  going  to

grab  the  bezel

which  is  over  here  or  you  could  present

beyond  the  keyboard  and  Im  going  to

click  to  create  a  point  outside  of  the

photo  here  and  Im  going  to  start

creating  points  going  around  the  edge  of

the  subject  here  just  like  this  and  if

you  notice  these  lines  arent  exactly

smooth  theyre  not  following  the

contours  of  the  subjects  outline  here

but  thats  okay  were  gonna  go  back  and

fix  that  later  so  dont  worry  about  that

right  now  just  go  ahead  and  click  to

create  these  points  going  around  the

subject  and  this  is  a  pretty  big  photo

with  a  lot  of  points  to  create  so  what

Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  do  this  and

Im  gonna  fast  forward  and  Ill  catch  up

with  you  what  Im  done

okay  so  as  you  can  see  here  I  went

around  the  outside  of  the  subject  here

and  Ive  traced  an  outline  coming  out  to

the  other  end  of  the  photo  what  Im

gonna  do  is  Im  just  gonna  bring  this

line  around  outside  the  photo  over  here

and  connect  it  back  to  the  starting

point  by  clicking  on  that  and  its  gonna

create  a  shape  there  like  that  if  you

notice  now  we  have  a  shape  going  around

the  outline  of  the  subject  let  me  go

ahead  and  undo  that  what  we  want  to  do

now  is  we  want  to  account  for  these

negative  space  areas  within  this  within

the  subject  here  assuming  your  photo

does  have  these  negative  space  areas  if

it  doesnt  dont  worry  about  it  but

were  gonna  have  to  eliminate  these

areas  like  between  the  hand  and  the

shoulder  over  here  and  the  same  over

here  on  this  side  so  Im  gonna  do  is  Im

gonna  create  more  shapes  inside  of  here

doing  the  same  thing  just  creating

following  along  the  contours  of  the

subject  with  the  Bezier  pen  by  creating

points  like  that  Ill  put  one  right

there  another  one  here  for  the  hair

okay  so  once  youre  done  accounting  for

all  of  the  areas  of  negative  space  what

we  want  to  do  is  combine  them  all

together  by  grabbing  the  select  tool

over  here  Im  gonna  grab  this  area  right

here  Im  gonna  hold  shift  and  click  on

the  other  one  so  that  we  can  select

multiples  at  a  time  Im  gonna  hold  shift

click  on  that  one  and  then  hold  shift

and  click  on  that  one  and  you  should

have  all  of  them  selected  if  you

shift-click  them  and  what  I  want  to  do

is  unify  them  together  by  going  to  path

Union  and  now  what  I  want  to  do  is  take

that  group  of  unified  objects  and

subtract  them  from  the  main  outline  that

we  created  in  the  background  over  there

so  with  this  group  of  objects  selected

Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  Im  going  to

click  on  the  original  outline  and  Im

gonna  go  to  path  difference  and  nothing

is  going  to  change  visually  on  the

screen  but  if  you  change  the  color  of

the  object  here  youll  see  it  now  fits

the  shape  of  the  subject  here  if  you  see

I  missed  that  one  so  let  me  just

subtract  that  as  well

path  difference  there  we  go  okay  so  what

I  want  to  do  now  is  I  want  to  go  back  to

where  what  I  was  talking  about  earlier

with  those  rough  lines  I  want  to  make

them  smooth  so  let  me  turn  off  the  fill

color  of  this  and  let  me  zoom  in  on  this

area  over  here  where  we  started  out  let

me  go  to  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool

over  here  or  a  good  pressed  end  on  the

keyboard  let  me  just  fix  that  one  its

not  quite  right  there  we  go  what  Im

gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  click  and  drag

over  this  node  right  here  and  Im  gonna

click  on  this  button  that  says  make

selected  nodes  Auto  smooth  and  its

gonna  make  that  node  smooth  so  that  its

no  longer  like  a  rough  like  a  like  a

polygonal  sort  of  corner  its  gonna  make

it  smooth  Ill  do  the  same  thing  with

this  node  over  here  make  that  smooth  and

what  were  gonna  do  is  were  gonna  go

through  and  do  this  with  all  of  these

nodes  but  were  not  gonna  do  this  node

by  node  because  that  would  take  forever

what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  select

these  multiples  at  a  time  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  them  you  cant

select  multiples  at  a  time  as  Im  doing

here  just  hold  your  shift  and  click  and

drag  over  them  and  make  sure  not  to

select  any  corner  so  let  me  show  you

what  I  mean  Im  gonna  come  over  here  Im

not  gonna  select  that  node  because  its

a  corner  I  dont  want  to  make  that

smooth  so  with  these  selected  let  me

make  those  Auto  smooth  and  if  you  notice

its  now  smooth  it  now  follows  the

contours  of  the  subject  theyre  a  little

more  closely  if  you  take  a  corner  node

and  you  make  that  smooth  youre  gonna

end  up  with  that  we  dont  want  to  end  up

with  that  right  there  so  let  me  undo

that  by  hitting  ctrl  Z

and  Im  gonna  go  through  and  select  more

of  these  nodes  making  sure  to  avoid  the

corners  like  I  previously  mentioned  let

me  see  let  me  see  how  this  looks  okay

good

let  me  go  through  here  and  do  this  as

well  Im  gonna  go  through  the  entire

image  and  do  this  with  all  of  these

nodes  and  then  once  again  Ill  Ill

catch  up  if  you  when  Im  done

okay  so  I  finished  going  through  and

smoothing  out  all  of  the  nodes  of  the

the  outline  here  now  were  ready  to  crop

so  what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  grab

the  select  tool  I  want  to  take  this

object  right  here  I  just  want  to  give

this  a  different  color  look  Im  gonna

make  this  green  for  example  just  so  we

can  see  what  exactly  will  be  cropping

right  here  now  what  I  want  to  do  is  get

rid  of  that  outline  so  Im  gonna  hold

shift  Im  gonna  click  on  this  little  red

X  down  here  in  the  bottom  left  corner

and  let  me  just  bring  the  opacity  of

this  down  a  little  bit  just  so  I  can  see

I  just  want  to  double  check  and  make

sure  that  everything  that  Im  cropping

out  here  looks  good  and  everything  it

does  it  looks  like  everything  looks  good

here  looks  like  its  gonna  be  a  clean

crop  so  what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna

hold  shift  and  Im  gonna  click  on  the

object  right  there  both  the  object  in

the  photo  we  want  them  both  selected  and

then  well  go  to  object  clip  set  and  if

you  notice  theyre  the  background  of  the

of  the  photo  is  now  gone  in  fact  you  can

create  a  rectangle  let  me  go  to  the

rectangle  tool  right  here

create  a  rectangle  grab  the  Select  tool

send  this  to  the  bottom  and  you  can  see

we  have  our  subject  cropped  out  from  the

background  now  if  any  point  you  want  to

go  back  and  remove  this  crop  you  just  go

to  object  clip  objects  clip  release  and

itll  release  it  so  you  can  go  back  to

the  original  photo  of  how  it  was

otherwise  you  can  just  leave  it  right

there  as  it  is  and  that  is  how  you  can

go  about  cropping  a  photo  with  Inkscape

if  you  have  any  questions  let  me  know

and  as  always  thanks  for  watching
