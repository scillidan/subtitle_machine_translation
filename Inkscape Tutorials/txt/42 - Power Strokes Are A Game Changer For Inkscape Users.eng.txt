in  previous  tutorials  ive  demonstrated

how  to  create  simple  line  style  drawings

from  photos  by  using  some  of  the  tool

settings  in  the  pen  tool  but  inkscape

has  come  a  very  long  way  since  then  and

theres  now  a  better  way  to  do  this

using  the  power  stroke  path  effect  in

this  lesson  ill  be  showing  you  how



so  lets  go  over  how  you  can  use  this

handy  feature  in  inkscape  were  going  to

start  off  by  drawing  a  single  line  using

the  bezier  pen  which  is  located  over

here  in  your  toolbar  or  you  could  access

it  by  pressing  the  letter  b  on  your

keyboard

im  going  to  click  on  the  canvas  once  to

create  a  point  and  then  im  going  to

hold  ctrl  on  the  keyboard  and  move  the

line  straight  across  my  screen  like  that

and  then  click  again  to  create  another

point  and  then  i  can  let  go  of  control

and  then  im  going  to  close  the  path  by

pressing  enter  on  the  keyboard  and  now

we  have  a  single  line  here  as  you  can

see

now  what  im  going to  do  is  grab  the

edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  which  is

located  over  here  and  im  going  to  click

and  drag  on  this  line  like  this  just  to

give  it  a  little  bit  of  a  curve  and  then

im  going  to  click  on  these  nodes  over

here

and  im  going  to  get  access  to  these

handles  and  use  these  handles  to  make

this

line  dip  down  over  here  and  then  rise  up

over  here  so  we  have  a  fluid  curved  line

like  that  now  im  creating  this  because

this  is  a  good

uh  way  to  depict  what  this  path  effect

does

so  once  weve  done  that  lets  grab  the

selection  tool  we  now  have  our  line

selected  im  going  to  open  up  the  path

effects  menu  by  going  to  path  and

selecting  path  effects

and  with  this  line  selected  i  want  to

click  this  little  plus  icon  down  here  in

the  bottom  right  corner  to  add  a  new

path  effect

and  the  path  effect  that  were  going  to

be  adding  from  this  list  is  called  power

stroke  now  instead  of  trying  to  navigate

through  this  list  and  find  it  you  can

just  use  the  search  bar  up  here  and  type

in  power

and  it  should  come  up  right  over  there

as  you  can  see  power  stroke  click  on

that

and  now  we  have  a  power  stroke  applied

what  we  want  to  do  to  edit  this  power

stroke  is  come  back  over  here  to  the

edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

and  youll  notice  on  your  path  you

should  see  three  pink  nodes  let  me  zoom

in  a little  bit  im  going  to  hold  ctrl

and  roll  up  the  mouse  wheel  so  you  can

see  it  better

theres  one  pink  node  right  here  in  the

center  point  of  the  path

and  then  over  here  theres  another  pink

point  on  the

on  the  left  hand  side  of  the  path  or

otherwise  known  as  the  start  point  of

the  path  where  you  originally  drew  the

path  first  and  then  over  here  towards

the  end  point  theres  another  pink  path

now  all  all  of  these  handles  allow  you

to  change  the  width  of  your  stroke

so  if  i  click  and  drag  on  this  pink  path

right  here  you  can  see  the  stroke  is

becoming  wider  as  i  move  it  like  this

and  if  i  use  this  handle  down  here  i  can

make  this  end  of  the  line  wider  as  well

i  could  even  move  this  the  opposite  way

and  get  like  a  little  bit  of  a  crossover

effect  there  but  im  going  to  use  this

to  make  this  about  that  size  and  then

ill  do  the  same  thing  over  here  ill

make  this  about  that  size  and  another

thing  that  you  can  do  is  you  can  move

the  location  of  these  handles

so  that  you  can  change  the  width  of  any

particular  spot  of  your  line  as  you  see

me  doing  here  i  could  give  this  a  line  a

bulge  over  here  so  that  this  kind  of

looks  like  a  leaf  or  a  paintbrush  maybe

or  i  could  bring  this  down  here  so  that

we  end  up  with  a

maybe  it  looks  more  like  a  follicle  of

hair  or  something  like  that  okay  so  let

me  put  this  back  over  here  let  me  show

you  what  some  of  these  tool  settings  are

over  here

in  the  bottom  right  hand  corner  of  the

screen  now  if  you  notice  theres  a  start

cap  and  then  theres  an  end  cap  the

start  cap  is  the  beginning  of  the  path

that  you  originally  drew  and  the  end  cap

is  the  end  of  the  path  that  was

most  recently  finished

now  if  i  change  this  by  default  its  set

to  zero  width  if  i  want  to  change  the

start  cap  to  rounded

or  to  lets  say  for  example  but

it  ends  up  with  the  flat

edge  like  that  so  you  could  take  this

handle  and  bring  this  over  here  like

this  and  pull  this  all  the  way  out  so

you  get  this  sort  of  effect  right  here

where  it  kind  of  looks  like  a  wispy  hair

okay  so  let  me  undo  that  and  then

theres  other  settings  in  here  you  could

try  as  well  you  can  make  this  peak

which  ends  up  with  something  like  this

right  here

or  you  can  make  this  round  so  that  you

have  a  rounded  path  like  that

you  can  make  this  square  so  you  have  a

squared  path  and  then  zero  width  takes

you  back  to  the  starting  point  with  the

fine  tip  like  that

so  lets  put  this  tool  into  context  and

use  it  to  create  a  simple  abstract

mountain  range  logo  im  going  to  grab

the  bezier  pen

and  im  going  to  create  some  points  on

my  canvas  in  the  shape  of  a  mountain  top

with  a  couple  of  peaks

as  you  can  see  here  like  this

and  ill  press  enter

and  now  im  going  to  add  the  power

stroke  path  effect  as  we  did  previously

grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  im

going  to  use  my  pink  handles  over  here

to  make  this  a  little  wider  im  going  to

use  this  handle  over  here  and  put  this

towards  the  top  of  the  base  of  the  leg

so  that  it  looks  a  little  more

consistent

there  we  go  and  i  want  this  side  to  be  a

little  thicker  than  the  rest  of  it  so

ill  make  that  a  little  bigger  like  that

now  if  you  notice  here  the  corners  of

this  mountain  range  are  rounded

the  reason  why  that  happens  is  because

the  default  setting  over  here  in  the

tool  settings  where  it  says  join

is  rounded  by  default  if  you  want

corners  there  what  i  would  recommend

doing  is  selecting  miter  and  as  you  can

see  now  we  get  sharp  corners  like  that

or  if  youre  working  with  curved  paths

sometimes  youll  want  to  use

extrapolated  arc  as  well  if  the  corners

dont  show  up  using  miter

for  this  demonstration  well  be  sticking

with  miter

okay  so  now  that  thats  done  im  going

to  create  another  line  im  going to  come

over  here

im  going  to  draw  a  line  over  here

start  a  point  right  there

start  another  point  right  there

and  press  enter  on  the  keyboard  and  im

going  to  grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes

tool  im  just  going  to  click  and  drag

this  down  like  that

and  ill  take  this  and  ill  maybe  bring

this  line  up  like  that

maybe  bring  this  one  down  a little  more

we  want  a  nice  fluid  curve  here

and  im  going  to  update  my  mountain

range

to  to  accommodate  this  swoosh  a  little

bit  im  going  to  take  this  side  right

here  move  that  up  a  little  bit

thats  a  little  better

and  now  im  going  to  apply  a  power

stroke  to  this  line  right  here

use  my  nodes  right  here  to  make  this

wider

make  this  a  little  wider

and  then  make  this  a  little  wider

and  maybe  even  make  this  a  little  wider

okay  thats  looking  a  lot  better

and  im  just  going  to  adjust  this  a

little  bit  make  sure  this  is  looking

the  way  id  like  it  to  look

and  there  we  go  id  say  thats  good

enough  so  what  im going  to  do  now  is

grab  the  selection  tool  as  you  can  see

now  as  you  can  see  here  we  have  created

a  very  simple  abstract  mountain  logo  now

at  any  point  you  can  go  back  and  edit

the  nodes  of  these  tools  you  can  go  back

and  edit  the  width  of  these  lines  over

here  like  that  of  the  power  stroke

and  if  at  any  point  you  want  to  finalize

this  so  that  it  becomes  an  editable  path

all  you  have  to  do  is  select  everything

and  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  if  you  go  back  to

your  nodes  tool  now  you  can  see  that

this  is  an  individual  path  that  was

created  using  that  power  stroke  function

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  todays

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  use  the

power  stroke  path  effect  in  inkscape

before  i  end  this  video  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  i  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  i  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  life  ill

have  some  information  about  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  as  always  thanks  for
