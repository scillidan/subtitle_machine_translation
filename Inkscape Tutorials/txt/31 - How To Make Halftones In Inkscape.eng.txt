in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  create  half  tone  gradients  using

inkscape  so  to  get  started  the  first

thing  Im  going  to  do  is  create  a  new

document  size  to  1280x720  your  document

doesnt  have  to  be  that  size  just  make

your  document  in  whatever  size  youd

like  your  gradient  to  be

so  Ill  turn  on  snapping  up  here  and

Ill  grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  Im

going  to  snap  to  the  corners  of  my

document  and  click  and  drag  to  create  a

rectangle  in  the  size  of  my  document

now  Im  going  to  make  this  rectangle

white  and  Im  going  to  apply  a  black  and

white  gradient  so  let  me  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  by  coming  up  here

to  where  it  says  object  and  selecting

fill  and  stroke

now  Under  The  Fill  tab  Im  going  to

select  this  button  right  here  that  says

linear  gradient

and  when  we  get  these  handles  here  on

the  screen  Im  going  to  select  this

handle  over  here  on  the  right  and  Im

going  to  make  this  one  black

and  then  Im  going  to  take  this  gradient

handle  and  snap  it  to  the  bottom  right

corner  and  Ill  take  this  gradient

handle  and  snap  it  to  the  top  right

corner

and  now  we  have  a  white  to  black  radiant

like  that

so  now  lets  open  up  the  layers  menu  let

me  grab  my  select  tool  lets  come  up

here  to  where  it  says  layer  and  select

layers  and  objects

and  what  were  going  to  do  now  is  were

going  to  turn  off  actually  no  were

going  to  lock  the  layer  here  and  then

click  the  plus  icon  over  here  to  create

a  new  layer

Im  going  to  click  add  Im  going  to

leave  the  default  as  it  is  make  sure

its  above  current  and  click  add  and  now

Im  going  to  zoom  in  on  the  top  left

corner  of  my  document  over  here  and  Im

going  to  grab  my  ellipse  tool  Im  going

to  snap  to  the  top  left  corner  and  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  to  create  a

circle  and  Im  going  to  hold  to  the

control  key  to  make  sure  were  creating

a  perfectly  round  circle  and  Ill  make

it  about  that  size  right  there  dont

worry  too  much  about  the  size  at  this

point  we  can  go  back  and  change  that

later

now  this  step  is  important  if  youre

using  one  of  the  newer  versions  of

inkscape  because  I  noticed  by  default  it

sets  the  stroke  to  unknown  so  come  over

here  to  the  fill  and  stroke  Tab  and

under  the  stroke  paint  tab  if  you  have

this  question  mark  box  highlighted  just

click  this  x  right  here  to  make  sure

theres  no  stroke  because  if  that  is

enabled  then  its  going  to  mess  up  what

were  about  to  do

so  now  once  youve  done  that

grab  your  selection  tool  with  the  object

selected  go  to  edit

clone  create  titled  clones

and  the  settings  were  going  to  use  here

were  going  to  use  Trace

select  the  option  right  here  that  says

trace  the  drawing  under  the  Clones  we

want  to  trace  by  color

were  going  to  leave  these  set  to  zero

and  the  only  two  options  we  want  enabled

over  here  are  size  and  color  and  then

come  down  here  and  choose  width  and

height  over  rows  and  columns  now  where

it  says  width  and  height  input  the  width

and  height  of  your  document  my  document

was  1280x720  so  I  have  that  there

already  and  then  I  just  have  this

enabled  here  to  save  these  settings  next

time  I  use  this  so  Ill  click  create  now

and  once  you  do  that  you  can  see  it

generates  those  it  generates  that  black

circle  over  the  linear  gradient  and

turns  it  into  this  halftone  gradient  so

lets  work  with  this  some  more  lets

first  go  back  to  our  layers  menu  let  me

collapse  this  and  Ill  turn  off  the

visibility  of  layer  1.  so  now  we  just

have  the  halftone  gradient  and  if  you

want  to  change  the  size  of  these  dots

you  could  zoom  in  on  this  let  me  grab

the  original  dot  over  here

and  let  me  turn  off  snapping  now  because

thatll  just  get  in  the  way  and  Ill

make  this  a  little  smaller

and  you  can  see  what  happens  as  I  make

that  smaller  it  makes  the  gradient

smaller  as  well  and  I  can  make  this

bigger  and  get  the  opposite  effect

now  we  have  that  effect  right  there  and

anything  I  do  to  this  object  will  also

be  applied  to  the  rest  of  these  dots  so

you  can  change  the  color  now  if  youd

like  as  well

and  there  you  go  that  is  how  you  can

create  a  simple  halftone  gradient  using

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

then  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

and  best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  17  one  time

and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill  have  some

information  about  that  down  below  if  you

want  to  check  that  out  as  always  thanks
