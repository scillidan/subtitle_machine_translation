in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  addressing  a

bug  that  exists  in  the  current  version

of  inkscape  where  converting  a  stroke  to

a  path  gives  you  a  different  result  than

what  you  expect  and  to  show  you  what  I

mean  I  have  this  simple  fourpoint  shape

that  is  a  stroke  and  if  I  convert  this

stroke  to  a  path  you  can  see  what

happens  we  end  up  with  a  broken  shape

now  this  is  not  whats  supposed  to

happen  so  I  would  imagine  this  is  some

kind  of  bug  in  the  software  now  the

inkscape  team  is  usually  good  with

addressing  these  sorts  of  things  so  Im

sure  this  will  be  ironed  out  in  the  next

update  but  in  this  tutorial  I  just  want

to  show  you  a  simple  fix  for  this  so  let

me  press  contrl  Z  to  undo  what  I  did

there  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going

to  select  the  object  and  now  before  I

convert  it  to  a  stroke  I  will  go  to  path

and  I  will  select  reverse  and  now  if  I

go  to  path  and  select  stroke  to  path  you

can  see  we  end  up  with  the  result  as

intended  now  I  dont  know  much  about  the

back  end  of  this  software  and  how  this

sort  of  thing  works  but  I  would  imagine

it  has  something  to  do  with  how  the

start  and  end  point  of  a  path  is  defined

because  the  reverse  function  is  normally

only  used  when  we  place  text  on  a  path

and  we  want  to  define  whether  the  text

goes  on  the  outside  of  the  path  or  the

inside  of  the  path  but  in  this  instance

its  also  useful  here  as  well  another

thing  you  can  do  you  can  also  flip  the

object  so  if  I  were  to  press  the  letter

H  on  my  keyboard  and  flip  it

horizontally  that  will  also  work  the

same  way  and  I  would  imagine  because  it

reverses  the  path  the  same  way  path

reverse  does  and  then  after  that  you

could  just  press  h  again  and  then  its

back  to  the  starting  point  so  that

should  do  it  for  todays  video  I  just

wanted  to  get  this  fix  out  there  in  case

you  were  encountering  this  problem  and

it  was  frustrating  you  if  you  have  any

questions  leave  a  comment  below  and  as

always  thanks  for  watching
