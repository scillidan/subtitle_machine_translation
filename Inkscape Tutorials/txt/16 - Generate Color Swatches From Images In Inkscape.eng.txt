in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  a  color  palette  from

the  colors  in  a  pixel-based  image  using

inkscape  so  the  first  thing  youll  want

to  do  is  import  your  image  onto  the

canvas  as  Ive  done  here  with  my  example

image  and  to  sample  the  colors  from  this

image  were  going  to  use  the  trace  bit

map  tool  so  Im  going  to  click  on  the

image  to  select  it  and  Ill  go  to  path

and  I  will  select  Trace

bitmap  now  the  settings  I  want  to  go

with  over  here  on  the  right  hand  side  of

the  screen  I  want  to  choose  the

multicolor  tab  and  then  I  want  to  come

over  here  to  this  dropdown  and  choose

colors  now  right  here  where  you  see  the

number  of  scans  this  represents  the

number  of  colors  that  will  be  sampled

from  your  image  and  you  could  see  a

preview  of  some  of  those  colors  over

here  in  this  preview  menu  now  if  you

notice  I  have  eight  which  is  the  default

which  you  can  see  it  includes  a  lot  of

the  colors  there  but  it  misses  the

pinkish  reddish  color  of  the  Hat  here  so

for  my  example  Im  going  to  increase

this  number  until  I  get  more  of  those

colors  that  I  want  to  include

and  once  youre  finished  all  you  have  to

do  is  click  the  apply  button  and  give  it

a  second  to  process  if  youre  using  a

lot  of  colors  like  I  am  in  my  example

its  going  to  take  a  minute  or  two  to

process  okay  so  the  trace  is  finished

Im  going  to  click  and  drag  the  trace  to

move  it  away  from  the

image  and  then  Im  going  to  select  the

image  and  press  delete  on  the  keyboard

to  get  rid  of  that  cuz  we  dont  need

that  anymore  I  just  want  the  vector

colors  here  and  Im  going  to  ungroup

this  so  I  will  go  to  object  and  I  will

select

ungroup  and  once  youve  done  that  you

can  click  off  of  the  image  to  deselect

everything  and  you  could  zoom  in  to  all

of  the  vector-based  elements  here  to  see

the  different  colors  that  you  could

sample  so  Im  going  to  start  off  with

this  pink  shade  right  here  Im  going  to

click  on  that  to  select  it  and  if  you

notice  over  here  youll  see  the  color

highlight  in  this  little  stripe  down

here  in  the  bottom  left  of  the  screen

Im  just  going  to  double  click  on  this

stripe  and  its  going  to  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  and  with  this

object  still  selected  I  want  to  go  to

the  fil  Tab  and  then  over  here  I  want  to

I  want  to  choose  this  button  right  here

that  says  Swatch  Im  going  to  click  on

that  and  its  going  to  add  that  color  to

a  new  Swatch  and  now  we  can  go  to  our

swatches  menu  by  going

to  view  and  selecting

swatches  now  you  should  see  your  Swatch

appearing  in  this  list  here  if  you  see

other  colors  populating  here  just  click

on  this  menu  and  choose  Auto  from  this

dropdown  so  now  that  we  know  how  to  do

that  we  can  go  add  some  more  colors  to

our  Swatch  here  so  Im  going  to  come

back  over  here  to  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  Im  going  to  choose  a  shade  of  blue

and  Im  going  to  add  that  to  my  swatch

as  well  and  if  you  notice  each  new

Swatch  you  add  will  be  indexed  in  this

menu  right  here  so  Im  going  to  add  some

more  and  once  youre  finished  once

youre  happy  with  all  of  your  swatches

you  can  zoom  out  you  can  press  control  a

on  your  keyboard  or  command  a  if  youre

using  Mac  to  select  everything  and  then

just  press  delete  because  we  dont  need

it  anymore  now  now  we  have  our  swatches

in  place  and  if  you  want  to  change  the

color  menu  down  here  at  the  bottom  of

the  screen  just  click  on  this  menu  icon

over  here  down  at  the  bottom  right  and

instead  of  inkscape  default  we  want  to

choose  Auto  and  once  we  have  Auto

selected  our  chosen  colors  that  we

created  from  the  image  will  appear  in

the  menu  there  and  if  you  want  to  make

those  icons  bigger  you  can  come  back

over  here  to  the  menu  and  choose

configure  and  you  could  CH  take  the  tile

size  and  increase  it  like  that  and  now

you  have  much  bigger  swatches  to  work

with  down  there  in  the  bottom  left

corner

and  now  when  you  create  new  objects  let

me  show  you  as  an  example  you  can  color

you  your  new  objects  using  these

swatches  down

here  so  now  lets  go  over  how  you  can

save  these  swatches  in  case  you  want  to

use  them  in  other  documents  in  the

future  now  there  is  no  way  to  directly

save  these  swatches  but  there  is  a

workaround  using  templates  so  what  you

want  to  do  is  save  this  entire  document

as  a  template  and  then  itll  be  saved

with  these  swatches  so  that  next  time

you  open  a  new  document  from  that

template  you  will  have  these  in  place  so

Im  going  to  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  file  and  go

to  save

template  and  Im  going  to  give  this  a

name  Im  just  going  to  name  this

nature

pallet  and  Ill  click

save  and  now  if  I  go  to  file  and  I

select  new  from

template  I  can  choose  the  custom  tab  Im

going  to  select  nature  pallet  and  click

create  from  template

and  in  my  new  document  I  can  go  to  view

select  swatches  and  there  my  color

palette  is  so  thats  how  you  can

generate  color  palettes  from  images
