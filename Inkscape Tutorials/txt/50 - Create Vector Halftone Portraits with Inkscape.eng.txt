this  is  nick  with  logos  by  nick.com  and

in  this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  take  an  image  and  use  it  to

trace  a  vector  halftone  portrait  using

inkscape  so  getting  us  started  here  in

inkscape  the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is

just  set  up  the  workflow  so  that  we  all

have  a  similar  setup  on  our  screen  im

going  to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

view

i  want  to  make  sure  i  have  custom

selected  and  then  i  want  to  zoom  i  want

to  go  to  view  zoom  and  zoom  in  at  one  to

one

okay  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going  to  import  my  example  photo  so  i

have  over  here  my  other  my  other  monitor

i  have  my  example  photo  im  going  to

click  and  drag  that  file  into  inkscape

im  going  to  leave  the  defaults  as  they

are  and  click  ok  and  there  we  go  there

is  the  example  photo  i  will  be  using  for

this  tutorial  this  is  just  a  stock  photo

that  i  grabbed  off  the  internet  ill

have  a  link  in  the  description  of  the

video  if  you  want  to  use  this  image

otherwise  you  can  use  whatever  image

youd  like

so  the  first  thing  we  have  to  do  is  make

this  image  black  and  white  so  im  going

to  make  sure  i  have  the  image  selected

and  ill  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

filters  and  ill  come  over  to  color  and

im  looking  for  grayscale

now  im  going  to  take  this  menu  im

going  to  tick  the  preview  box  right  here

just  to  give  us  a  preview  of  how  this

looks  uh  if  you  want  you  can  adjust  your

rgb  values  up  here  as  well  as  the  as  the

uh  the  lightness  i  like  how  this  looks

as  it  is  so  im  just  going  to  leave  it

as  it  is  and  click  apply

and  now  that  weve  done  that  now  that

this  is  applied  we  can  close  out  of  this

menu  and  now  i  want  to  open  up  the

layers  menu  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  can  just  press  ctrl

shift  and  l  on  your  keyboard

so  right  this  right  here  layer  one  this

is  the  layer  where  the  image  is  located

we  want  to  create  a  new  layer  to  trace

our  halftone  portrait  over  this  image  so

im  going  to  click  the  plus  icon  down

here  and  im  going  to  add  a  new  layer

im  going  to  use  the  layer  name  im  just

going  to  leave  the  default  and  position

we  want  to  make  sure  we  have  above

current  and  then  go  ahead  and  click  add

now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

create  a  single  circle  going  over  this

image  right  here  so  let  me  grab  the

circles  and  ellipses  tool  im  going  to

click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  to  create  a

circle  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  on  the

keyboard  so  it  makes  a  perfectly  round

circle  like  that

and  im  going  to  make  this  black  let  me

grab  the  select  tool  and  put  this

towards  the  top  of  the  uh  the  top  left

corner  of  the  image  right  here  and  in

fact  im  going  to  scale  that  down  a

little  more

what  i  want  to  do  is  align  this  in  the

top  left  corner  here  so  lets  open  up

the  alignment  menu  which  is  over  here  or

you  could  press  ctrl  shift  a

and  with  this  circle  selected  im  going

to  hold  shift  and  im  going  to  click  on

the  image  so  we  have  them  both  selected

and  in  the  align  distribute  menu  i  want

to  make  sure  i  have  last  selected  chosen

from  this  relative  drop  down  and  i  want

to  align  this

to  the  left  edge  and  then  i  want  to

align  this  to  the  top  edge  so  that  is

right  there  in  the  top  left  corner  and

now  we  can  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything

so  now  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

the  circle  so  i  have  just  the  circle

selected  and  im  going  to  go  to  edit

clone

create  tiled  clones

and  in  this  menu  over  here  what  were

looking  for  is

the  trace  option

now  from  these  settings  over  here  you

want  to  make  sure  you  have  traced  the

drawing  under  the  clone  spray  items  you

want  to  have  that  selected  you  want  to

have  color  selected  you  want  to  leave

the  defaults  as  they  are  over  here  and

then  down  here  we  only  want  presence  and

size  selected  we  dont  want  either  of

these  selected  and  then  down  here  apply

the  tiled  clones  to  we  want  to  choose

width  and  height  and  we  want  to  change

the  width  and  height  to  match  the  width

and  height  of  this  image  so  let  me  click

on  this  image  here  so  i  can  see  the

width  and  height  as  you  can  see  the

width  is  a  thousand  pixels  wide  and  then

778

pixels  high

so  im  going  to  change  this  over  here

let  me  select  the  circle  again

im  going  to  change  this  to  pixels  and

im  going  to  change  this  to  the  same

size  that  uh  the  images  over  here  which

is  1000  by  778  as  you  can  see  i  already

have  it  inputted  here  so  once  youve

done  that  you  can  just  go  ahead  and

click  create

and  as  you  can  see  its  going  to  create

a  bunch  of  copies  of  that

a  bunch  of  copies  of  that  circle  and  use

it  to  trace  over  the  image  here  and  you

can  see  it  a  little  better  if  you  come

over  here  to  the  layers  menu  and  turn

off  the  visibility  of  layer  one  you  can

see  where  it  traced  that  image  a  little

better

now  let  me  turn  that  back  on  let  me  come

over  here  let  me  undo  what  i  just  did

there  by  pressing  ctrl  z  let  me  undo  it

again  ctrl  z  one  more  time  ctrl  z  and

there  we  go  what  i  want  to  do  is  make

this  circle  a  little  smaller  and  see  if

i  can  get  a  better  result  because  i

clicked  on  the  wrong  thing  let  me  make

this  a  little  smaller

click  on  create

and  as  you  can  see  with  the  smaller

circle  it  added  more  circles  in  here

theres  more  circle  density  so  i  think

that  looks  a  little  better  if  you  want

let  me  undo  that  again

if  you  want  you  can  make  this  larger  and

see  how  that  looks  this  is  just  a  matter

of  personal  preference  at  this  point  if

you  go  ahead  and  click  on  create  you  can

see  how  that  looks  right  there  i  liked

how  it  looked  better  with  the  smaller

circle  so  let  me  undo  that  one  more  time

and  let  me  just  make  that  a  little

smaller  like  that  click  on  create

there  we  go  now  im  going  to  come  over

here  to  the  layers  menu  im  going  to

turn  off  the  visibility  of  layer  one  and

if  you  zoom  out  you  can  really  see  the

portrait  it  almost  looks  like  an  actual

image  but  if  you  zoom  in  all  the  way  you

can  see  this  is  indeed  a  vector  tracing

there  is  no  quality  loss  here  as  you

zoom  in  these  are  vectors  and  the  cool

thing  about  this  is  that  all  of  these

circles  are  linked  to  the  original

circle  so  whatever  you  do  to  that

original  circle  will  be  applied  to  all

of  the  other  circles  as  well  let  me  show

you  what  i  mean  im  going  to  zoom  in

over  here  im  going  to  take  this

original  circle  and  move  it  out  of  the

way

let  me  zoom  out  to  zoom  im  just  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  and  down  the  mouse

wheel  to  move  the  page  around  just

pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel  and  moving

the  mouse  im  going  to  take  that  circle

and  im  going  to  make  that  blue

and  as  you  can  see  it  made  all  of  the

other  circles  blue  and  this  works  with

any  other  transformation  as  well  if  i

make  this  a  little  bigger

its  going  to  make  all  of  those  circles

a  little  bigger  and  i  think  that  looks

better  right  there  up  close  it  looks

like  a  tracing  of  a  bunch  of  little

circles  but  if  you  zoom  out  you  can  see

it  looks  more  like  a  photograph

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  very  easily

go  about  creating  your  own

halftone  portraits  using  images  in

inkscape  if  you  have  any  questions  just

thanks  for  watching
