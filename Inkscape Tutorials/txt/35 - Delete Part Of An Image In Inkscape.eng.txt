so  lets  go  over  how  you  can  use

inkscape  to  delete  part  of  an  image  on

my  screen  here  I  have  this  example  image

opened  up  and  for  this  demonstration  I

will  be  removing  the  zebra  from  this

image  so  the  result  will  be  an  area  of

transparency  where  the  zebra  currently

is  in  order  to  accomplish  this  Im  going

to  be  creating  a  vector  path  in  the

shape  of  my  subject  that  Id  like  to

delete  and  then  Ill  be  creating  an

inverse  clipping  path  out  of  it  so  lets

go  over  how  you  can  do  this  so  in  order

to  create  a  shape  over  my  subject  here

Im  going  to  custom  draw  a  shape  using

the  pen  tool  let  me  zoom  in  Im  going  to

hold  Ctrl  and  roll  up  the  mouse  wheel  a

couple  of  times  to  zoom  in  Im  going  to

grab  the  bezier  pen  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  could  press  the  letter

B  on  your  keyboard

and  the  setting  that  Im  going  to  use

for  this  particular  subject  here  is  this

setting  up  here  that  says  create  B

spline

and  once  thats  done  Im  just  going  to

zoom  in  over  here  and  Im  going  to  move

the  page  around  by  pressing  down  the

mouse  wheel  and  moving  the  mouse  and  Im

going  to  begin  clicking  to  create  points

around  my  subject  here  as  you  can  see

here  now  that  wasnt  very  accurate  so

let  me  undo  that  if  you  want  to  undo  the

points  that  you  create  at  any  point  you

just  have  to  press  Ctrl  Z  Im  just  going

to  go  and  create  a  outline  around  my

subject  using  the  pen  tool  like  this  and

with  this  setting  with  the  B  spline

setting  youll  see  it  automatically

makes  the  lines  curved  but  if  at  any

point  you  want  to  make  a  straight  line  I

mean  a  sharp  corner  like  you  see  here

all  you  have  to  do  is  hold  shift  and

click  and  then  it  creates  a  sharp  corner

as  you  can  see  there  so  Im  going  to  go

through  here  and  Im  going  to  draw  my

lines  like  this  Im  going  to  hold  shift

put  a  point  here

continue  along  the  inside  of  my  path

here  and  Im  just  going  to  go  around

this  entire  subject  and  trace  an  outline

and  once  youre  finished  drawing  your

line  you  can  connect  it  back  to  the

starting  point  like  that  to  close  the

path  and  now  we  have  our  shape  going

around  the  subject  here  now  let  me  fill

this  in  with  the  color  just  so  we  can

see  it  Im  going  to  use  the  color  green

here  and  Im  going  to  get  rid  of  that

outline  Im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  this  little  red  X  down  here  and

now  we  have  a  subject  that  we  can  use  to

delete  part  of  our  image  now  the  thing

is  if  we  use  this  object  and  create  a

clipping  mask  what  its  going  to  do  is

the  opposite  its  going  to  delete

everything  except  for  the  zebra  so  we

want  to  create  the  inverse  of  that  or  an

inverse  clipping  path  now  inkscape  has

an  inverse  clipping  path  sending  built

in  but  unfortunately  it  only  works  with

Vector  objects  so  in  order  to  do  this

with  the  rasterized  photo  like  we  have

here  were  going  to  have  to  do  this

manually  so  let  me  grab  this  selection

tool  let  me  click  off  of  the  graphic  to

deselect  everything  Im  now  going  to

create  a  rectangle  in  the  size  of  this

image  here  Im  going  to  click  on  the

image  and  Im  going  to  go  to  edit

copy  and  then  Im  going  to  grab  my

rectangle  tool  and Im  going  to  click

and  drag  to  create  a  rectangle  like  that

and  Im  going  to  make  this  a  different

color  than  the  color  we  just  used  Ill

just  go  with  blue  for  now  and  then  Ill

go  to  edit

were  looking  for  paste  size  and  paste

size

and  now  Im  going  to  grab  the  selection

tool  and  with  this  rectangle  selected

Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

image  so  we  havent  both  selected  and

then  Im  going  to  open  up  the  Align  and

distribute  menu  which  is  over  here  on

the  right  if  you  dont  have  it  opened

you  can  press  Ctrl  shift  and  a  on  the

keyboard  or  you  can  come  over  to  where

it  says  object  and  select  align  and

distribute  and  the  menu  should  open  up

over  here  on  the  right  now  with  this

menu  open  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have

last  selected  Chosen  and  then  Im  going

to  Center  this  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  like  that  and  now  Im

going  to  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything  Im  going  to  click  on  just

the  blue  the  blue  square  here  and  Im

going  to  lower  this  beneath  the  green

object  that  we  created  so  Im  going  to

come  up  here  to  this  menu

where  it  says  a  lower  selection  One  Step

press  that  and  it  should  lower  it

beneath  the  object  we  just  drew  and  now

Im  going  to  hold  shift  click  on  the

object  so  we  have  them  both  selected  and

go  to  object  and  Im  sorry  path  and  go

to  difference  and  now  we  have  this  right

here

so  now  we  can  do  is  we  can  click  and

drag  over  everything

and  go  to  object

clip

set  clip

and  just  like  that  we  have  deleted  part

of  the  image

by  creating  a  clipping  mask  now  the  good

thing  about  this  is  that  its

non-destructive  meaning  you  can  undo

this  at  any  point  if  at  any  point  you

want  to  put  the  deleted  part  of  the

image  back  to  where  it  was  just  select

the  image  and  go  to  object  clip  and  go

to  release  clip  and  there  you  go  now

youre  back  to  where  youre  started  with

those  objects  as  they  are  so  I  think

that  should  do  it  for  this  lesson  that

is  how  you  can  use  inkscape  to  delete

part  of  a  pixel  based  rasterized  image

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  17  one  time  and  youre  in  for

Life  Ill  have  some  information  about

that  down  below  if  you  want  to  check

that  out  as  always  thanks  for  watching



thank  you
