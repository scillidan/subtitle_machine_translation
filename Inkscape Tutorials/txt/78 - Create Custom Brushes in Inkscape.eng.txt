this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  your  own  custom

brushes  in  Inkscape  and  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  Inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  my  Inkscape

masterclass  its  a  collection  of  over  50

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  Inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  Ill  have  a  link  in  the  description

of  the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that

out  so  to  get  us  started  here  in

Inkscape  the  way  that  this  works  is

Inkscape  doesnt  actually  have  a  brushes

feature  built  in  but  what  it  does  have

is  it  has  tools  like  the  pencil  tool

over  here  which  allow  you  to  use  a

custom  shape  based  on  what  you  have

copied  to  your  clipboard  and  thats  what

well  be  doing  here  so  to  show  you  an

example  of  how  this  works  Im  just  gonna

create  a  square  over  here  a  regular

perfectly  symmetrical  square  like  that

let  me  just  convert  this  to  a  path  by

going  to  path  object  to  path  let  me

scale  that  down  Im  gonna  right  click

this  and  Im  gonna  go  to  copy  and  then

Ill  come  over  here  to  the  pencil  tool

and  if  you  notice  over  here  I  have  these

settings  Im  using  create  regular  Bezier

path  the  smoothing  Im  gonna  have  that

set  to  about  75  Ill  explain  that  in  a

minute  and  where  it  says  shape  Im  gonna

have  this  set  to  from  a  clipboard  and  if

I  click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  like  that

youll  notice  what  it  basically  do  is  it

took  that  square  and  stretched  it  out

along  that  path  right  here  and  if  I  go

to  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  youll

notice  youll  get  a  little  handle  right

here  and  you  can  stretch  out  the  width

of  this  path  right  here  and  you  could

even  change  the  the  path  itself  like  how

it  flows  and  everything  like  that  so  let

me  get  rid  of  this  let  me  come  back  over

here  to  the  pencil  tool  just  to  show  you

something  else  here  over  here  where  it

says  smoothing  this  determines  how  rough

or  how  smooth  the  line  that  you  create

is  if  I  bring  this  smoothing  all  the  way

down  to  something  like  10  and  I  leave  it

there  and  then  I  go  to  create  another

line  youll  notice  its  a  lot  more  a  lot

more  of  my  hand  tremors  are  reflected  in

the  the  contour  of  that  line  right  there

now  let  me  undo  that  if  I  bring  the

smoothing  up  even  higher  if  I  bring  it

up  too  high  to  like  maybe  something  like

92  Ill  go  to  create  a  curved  line  and

wont  curve  as  much  as  as  I  drew  it

itll  be  nice  and  smooth  but  itll  be

hard  to  get  those  real  curves  that  youd

like  to  draw  in  that  line  so  Ive  found

that  a  good  a  good  area  is  about  75  I

like  to  use  about  75  that  gives  you  a

nice  fluid  line  without  having  any  of

the  the  rough  shakes  from  from  your  hand

so  let  me  take  this  get  rid  of  this  now

let  me  show  you  how  this  can  work  with

like  other  custom  shapes  like  stars  Im

gonna  create  this  star  over  here  Im

gonna  use  a  regular  star  instead  of  a

polygon  Im  gonna  use  eight  corners  the

spoke  ratio  is  0.75  and  rounded  and

randomized  both  set  at  zero  and  Im

gonna  click  and  drag  on  the  camp  so  Im

just  gonna  hold  ctrl  and  shift  so  we

create  that  star  like  that  there  we  go

thats  what  Im  looking  for  and  Ill  go

to  path  object  to  path  to  convert  that

to  a  path  object  and  now  I  can  grab  the

Edit  path  by  nodes  tool  and  Im  just

gonna  click  and  drag  over  all  of  those

nodes  and  click  this  little  plus  icon  in

here  to  add  some  new  nodes  in  there  and

then  what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  go

to  extensions  modify  path  jitter  nodes

and  I  have  this  set  here  to  3.0  and  3.0

for  both  the  X  and  y-axis  the  shift

nodes  and  shift  handles  both  enabled  and

Im  gonna  click  on  distribution  we  want

uniform  Im  gonna  click  on  live  preview

just  to  see  what  that  looks  like  and

that  right  there  is  what  were  looking

for  like  a  like  a  rough  kind  of  it  kind

of  looks  like  an  inkblot  is  what  Im

looking  for  there  Im  gonna  click  a  pie

and  Im  actually  gonna  simplify  this

path  a  little  bit  Ill  go  to  path

simplify  or  you  can  just  press  ctrl  L

and  you  might  want  to  click  that  a  few

more  times  Ill  try  ctrl  L  a  couple  more

times  something  like  that  looking  pretty

good  now  let  me  scale  that  down  Im

gonna  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  maintain

the  proportions  and  now  Im  gonna  copy

that  to  the  clipboard  by  right-clicking

it  going  to  copy  come  back  over  here  to

the  pencil  tool  or  the  draw  freehand

lines  tool  and  then  just  click  and  drag

on  the  canvas  like  that  and  youll

notice  it  draws  like  this  nice  it  looks

like  a  streak  of  paint  now  if  you  come

back  over  here  to  the  nodes  tool  you  can

change  the  thickness  of  this  to  make  it

look  even  better  like  that  and  when

youre  drawing  your  lines  let  me  come

back  over  here  to  the  tool  if  when

youre  drawing  your  lines  youre  getting

like  an  outline  with  no  fill  you  can

change  the  settings  of  that  up  here

where  it  says  fill  and  Stroke  you  just

click  on  that

and  it  has  the  tool  settings  right  here

now  I  think  by  default  that  has  this  to

this  tool  zone  style  and  has  that  set  by

default  but  I  just  changed  it  to  this

right  here  last  use  style  so  thats

another  feature  you  can  work  with  a

little  further  here  in  Inkscape  so  I

think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial

oh  wait  you  know  what  one  more  thing  I

just  want  to  show  you  once  youre  happy

with  how  your  your  your  brushstroke

looks  what  you  can  do  is  you  can

finalize  it  by  going  to  path  object  to

path  and  now  you  can  edit  it  and  work

with  it  like  any  other  path  oops  it  has

individual  nodes  as  you  can  see  here  so

I  think  that  should  do  it

I  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  if  you
