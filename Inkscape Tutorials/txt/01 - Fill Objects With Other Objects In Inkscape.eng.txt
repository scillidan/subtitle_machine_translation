in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating  a

simple  technique  for  taking  a  single

object  and  filling  it  with  another

object  using  inkscape  before  we  get

started  though  if  you  want  to  learn  more

about  how  inkscape  Works  be  sure  to

check  out  my  inkscape  master  class  its

a  collection  of  over  80  videos  where  we

go  over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  kind  of  like

how  Ill  do  in  this  video  we  even  have  a

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  need  it  Ill  have  some  information

about  that  down  below  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  and  now  that  that  out  of

the  way  lets  get  started  so  Im  going

to  open  up  a  blank  document  and  Im

going  to  grab  my  text  tool  by  either

grabbing  it  from  the  toolbar  over  here

or  just  pressing  the  letter  t  on  the

keyboard  and  Im  going  to  click  on  the

canvas  and  for  this  demonstration  Im

just  going  to  use  the  letter  s  Im  going

to  use  a  large  capital  letter  s  Im

going  to  hold  control  and  scale  this  up

so  that  we  maintain  the  aspect  ratio  and

let  me  open  up  my  text  editor  by  going

to  text  and  selecting  text  and  font  and

Im  going  to  change  the  font  of  this  to

monserat  Black  and  Im  going  to  use  a

very  heavyweight  front  for  this  because

it  gives  us  more  space  to  fill  in  with

that  object  let  me  scale  this  up  some

more  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a  path

by  going  to  path  object  to  path  and  then

I  will  quote  unquote  ungroup  it  by  going

to  object  ungroup  now  nothing  visibly

changes  there  but  it  just  its  a

function  thats  required  to  make  this

work  as  needed  and  now  Im  going  to  open

up  the  layers  menu  by  going  to  layer  and

selecting  layers  and  objects  and  if  you

notice  here  this  text  next  object  is

located  on  layer  one  Im  going  to  create

a  new  layer  on  top  of  this  where  Im

going  to  place  the  object  that  I  would

like  to  fill  this  in  with  so  Im  going

to  click  this  plus  icon  up  here  and  its

going  to  add  a  new  layer  and  I  have  an

object  already  copied  to  my  clipboard

Im  just  going  to  press  control  V  to

paste  that  in  there  you  can  use  any

object  you  want  to  fill  in  your  shape  or

letter  you  can  use  a  single  object  or  as

in  my  case  Im  using  a  grouping  of

objects  here  so  I  have  this  orange  slice

that  I  created  Im  just  going  to  fill  it

in  with  this  let  me  scale  this  down  a

little  bit  and  I  want  to  Center  this  I

want  to  put  this  in  the  top  left  corner

of  this  object  but  first  let  me  take

this  object  and  make  note  of  the  size  if

I  come  up  here  to  the  the  settings  where

it  says  W  and  H  for  width  and  height  you

can  see  the  size  Im  going  to  size  this

at  500  pixels  wide  and  then  its  going

to  go  to  about  580  pixels  high  so  Im

going  to  make  a  mental  note  of  this

width  and  height  for  my  instance  here

Im  going  to  use  500  by  600  Im  just

going  to  round  up  to  make  it  easier  Im

going  to  click  on  this  object  hold  shift

click  on  this  object  and  I  want  to  align

those  two  together  so  let  me  come  up

here  to  object  and  go  to  align  and

distribute  and  let  me  choose  last

selected  and  Im  going  to  align  the  left

edges  and  the  top  edges  so  that  it

places  the  object  in  the  top  left  corner

of  this  objects  bounding  box  and  now  I

can  click  off  of  it  to  select  every  to

deselect  everything  so  let  me  just  come

over  here  to  my  layers  menu  and  make

sure  I  have  everything  as  I  need  it  this

object  here  is  in  Layer  Two  and  this

this  object  is  layer  one  everything

looks  good  there  now  Im  going  to  use

the  tiled  clones  feature  to  generate

copies  of  this  image  inside  or  this

graphic  inside  of  this  letter  so  to  do

that  Im  going  to  go  to  edit  clone  and

choose  create  tiled  clones  and  the

settings  Im  going  to  use  for  this  Im

first  going  to  come  over  here  to  scale

and  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have  the

randomized  column  set  to  50%  for  both

the  X  and  the  Y  AIS  make  sure  you  have

zeros  in  here  it  should  be  by  default

but  if  not  just  make  sure  to  enter  zeros

and  then  Ill  come  over  here  to  the

rotation  we  want  to  rotate  this  object

as  well  we  dont  want  it  to  just  be  the

same  rotation  all  the  way  through  we

want  randomized  rotation  so  I  set  the

randomize  to  100%  Im  going  to  leave

these  two  at  zero  and  bluring  opacity

Ill  leave  that  empty  color  Ill  leave

that  empty  and  Ill  come  over  here  to

trace  you  want  to  enable  this  option

right  here  that  says  trace  the  drawing

under  the  Clone  SL  spray  items  and  were

going  to  choose  the  opacity  setting  and

then  only  the  presence  setting  make  sure

you  deselect  these  other  settings  here

and  now  when  we  choose  between  rows  and

columns  or  width  and  height  were  going

to  choose  width  and  height  and  were

going  to  enter  that  width  and  height  of

this  object  that  you  made  note  of

earlier  so  for  my  example  here  I  was

doing  this  earlier  so  these  numbers  are

already  there  its  500  by  600  so  now

with  that  in  place  Im  going  to  click

the  create  button  and  it  should  generate

copies  of  that  object  within  the  other

object  now  if  you  notice  the  copies  are

kind  of  large  I  didnt  really  like  how

that  came  out  so  Im  going  to  press

press  command  Z  or  control  Z  to  undo

that  and  Im  going  to  make  this  object  a

little  smaller  and  try  that  again  Im

going  to  make  that  a  little  bit  smaller

let  me  Zoom  back  out  and  click  the

create  button  again  and  see  how  that

goes  okay  that  looks  a  little  better  but

still  a  little  large  let  me  undo  that

again  and  Ill  make  this  a  little  bit

smaller  and  this  should  do  the  trick

this  time  let  me  try  it  one  more

time  okay  that  looks  a  lot  better  so  now

that  thats  in  place  let  me  zoom  in  on

this  a  little  bit  let  me  close  out  of

the  tille  Clones  menu  we  dont  need  that

anymore  if  you  notice  the  objects  are

overlapping  each  other  which  doesnt

really  create  a  good  effect  we  want  them

to  be  not  overlapping  so  to  correct  that

Im  going  to  hold  control  and  shift  and

take  this  original  object  and  scale  it

down  a  little  bit  and  if  you  notice  when

I  do  that  all  of  the  other  objects  scale

down  as  well  because  these  are  all

linked  clones  so  whatever  I  do  to  this

original  object  it  will  also  happen  to

these  other  objects  so  scaling  it  up  and

down  will  help  increase  and  decrease  the

density  of  the  objects  within  the  shape

and  that  right  there  looks  like  a  good

happy  medium  Im  going  to  move  this  out

of  the  way  if  you  notice  we  have  some

imperfections  in  here  a  lot  of  these

objects  went  outside  of  the  shape  thats

okay  we  could  just  go  through  and  click

on  them  and  press  delete  one  by  one  to

get  rid  of  them  so  Im  just  going  to  go

through  here  and  delete  these  real

quick  and  another  thing  youll  probably

want  to  do  let  me  just  get  rid  of  that

one  as  well  another  thing  youll  want  to

do  is  go  and  move  these  around  a  little

bit  just  to  correct  the  spacing  and  we

were  just  going  to  do  this  manually

were  going  to  go  through  these  one  by

one  let  me  come  up  here  to  the  top  of

the  layers  menu  Im  going  to  collapse

layer  two  so  I  can  see  layer  one  and  I

want  to  lock  layer  one  so  that  I  dont

accidentally  move  the  layer  or  the

object  in  the  layer  with  what  Im  about

to  do  because  what  what  Im  going  to  do

now  is  Im  just  going  to  manually  move

these  objects  around  so  that  they  are

sitting  on  the  edge  of  the  shape  or  the

letter  and  you  may  have  to  just  manually

adjust  these  so  that  they

are  uh  evenly  spaced  out  and  they  dont

overlap  each  other  or  they  dont  look

like  theyre  big  gaps  between  them  so

Im  just  going  to  balance  these  out  a

little  bit  and  again  this  is  something

were  going  to  do  manually  you  can  hold

control  and  scale  it  up  and  down  and  if

you  want  to  make  additional  copies  you

could  just  click  and  drag  it  and  then

press  the  space  bar  and  itll  make

copies  of  it  so  you  can  just  make  copies

in  there  like  that  by  pressing  your

space  bar  and  Ill  move  these  around  a

little  bit  as  well  and  I  think  you  get

the  idea  so  let  me  just  go  through  here

real  quick  and  just  straighten  this  out

so  that  it  looks  good  and  then  I  will

catch  up  with  you  when  Im  finished

all  right  so  for  the  most  part  I

finished  up  here  theres  a  few  loose

ends  that  need  to  be  tied  up  this  one

looks  a  little  big  and  theres  some

empty  gaps  in  there  but  you  should  get

the  idea  by  now  the  really  important

thing  when  doing  this  is  to  make  sure

that  you  have  these  objects  as  close  to

the  edge  of  the  larger  object  as

possible  because  thats  whats  really

going  to  help  it  maintain  its  appearance

as  the  original  shape  if  they  get  too

far  from  The  Edge  its  going  to  kind  of

lose  its  appearance  so  thats  really

important  and  once  youre  done  doing  all

of  this  these  objects  should  still  be

linked  together  so  you  can  still

increase  or  decrease  the  size  of  these

clones  if  you  want  to  using  the  original

but  I  think  it  looks  good  as  it  was  so

Ill  just  put  that  back  and  now  that

thats  done  let  me  come  back  up  here  to

my  top  the  top  of  my  layers  menu  Im

going  to  collapse  Layer  Two  where  all

those  all  of  those  clones  are  and  Ill

come  over  here  to  layer  one  and  Im  just

going  to  turn  off  the  visibility  of  it

and  you  can  see  the  effect  now  Ive

taken  this  object  and  filled  in  the

other  object  with  copies  of  it  and  maybe

Ill  even  make  this  a  little

bigger  yeah  that  looks  pretty  good  I

like  how  that  looks  right  there  and  yeah

I  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  so  thats  how  you  can  use  the

tiled  clones  feature  in  inkscape  to  fill

in  an  object  with  another  object  if  you

have  any  questions  just  leave  a  comment
