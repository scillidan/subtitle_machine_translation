this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  design  your  own  book  covers

using  inkscape  and  i  dont  just  mean  a

book  cover  for  an  ebook  i  mean  an  actual

physical  book  cover  that  you  would  print

and  use  on  a  book  as  you  can  see  here  in

the  mock-up  before  we  get  started  though

if  youd  like  to  learn  everything  that

there  is  to  know  about  enscape

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over

all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  i  explained  what  they  are

and  demonstrate  how  they  work

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

okay  so  as  you  can  see  here  ive  opened

up  the  kindle  direct  publishing

uh  this  is  there  this  is  amazons  print

on  demand  service  for  uh  having  your  own

books

printed  ill  be  showing  you  how  to  use

this  service  here  because  this  is  the

one  that  people  most  commonly  use  when

they  have  books  printed

in  order  to  design  your  book  cover  with

inkscape  you  first  have  to  come  here  and

download  a  template

for  the  size  of  book  youd  like  to  print

so  if  you  notice  over  here  we  have  all

these  different  sizes  to  choose  from  we

have  a  page  count  to  choose  from  and  we

have

color  options  to  choose  from  for  the

paper  as  well  for  this  demonstration

ill  be  showing

you  how  to  design  a  six  inches  by  nine

inches  book  with  200  pages  in  it

with  white  paper  now  if  you  go  ahead  and

click  the  download  cover  template  button

you  should  get  a  zip  folder  and  within

that  zip  folder  is  a

dot  png  file  that  we  will  be  working

with  in  inkscape

okay  so  getting  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is  just  set

up  the  documents  that  we  all  have  a

similar  workflow  here

im  going  to  come  up  here  and  turn  off

snapping  i  want  to  change  the

units  of  measurement  to  pixels  and  then

i  will  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

view  and  make  sure  you  have  custom

selected

and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going  to  import  that  png  template  onto

my  canvas  here  by  just  clicking  and

dragging  it  onto  the  canvas  like  that

now  you  cant  see  where  this  is  coming

from  because  i  have  this  folder  opened

up  on  my  other  monitor  but  if  you  take

the  dot  png  file

and  click  and  drag  it  onto  your  canvas

like  that  you  should  get  this  little

this  little  menu  that  pops  up  and  from

these  defaults  here  we  want  to  make  sure

we  have  embed

from  image  dpi  default  import  resolution

and  for  image  rendering  mode

none  and  once  you  have  those  presets  as

they  are  click  ok

and  it  should  import  your  image  as  you

can  see  here  now  let  me  zoom  out  a

little  bit  so  i  can  see  that  a  little

better

you  hold  ctrl  roll  down  the  mouse  wheel

a  couple  of  times

okay  so  theres  our  template  a  couple  of

things  about  this  template

this  image  right  here  represents  the

size  that  our  document  needs  to  be  so

what  im  going  to  do  is  i  want  to  resize

the  document  so  that  it  fits

this  image  right  here  now  if  you  notice

this  is  the  document  size  right  here  as

it  stands

so  in  order  to  change  that  what  im

going  to  do  is  im  going  to  select  the

image

and  im  going  to  press  ctrl  shift  and  r

on  the  keyboard

and  thats  going  to  change  the  document

size  to  match

the  size  of  the  selection  there  as  you

can  see  there  a  couple  of  more  things  uh

worth  noting  about  this  template  over

here  youll  notice  this  dotted  line

going  around  the  edge

of  the  image  here  this  dotted  line

represents  the  bleed  cutoff

once  this  document  is  printed  everything

outside  of  this  dotted  line  will  be

trimmed  off

and  then  this  pink  area  right  here

represents  the  safe  area

meaning  all  of  your  contents  of  your

design  need  to  be

away  from  this  pink  area  if  you  have  any

elements  like  text  or  imagery  that  touch

this  pink  area  or  start  to  bleed  out

into  that  area

uh  amazon  will  reject  your  book  cover

design  so  thats  something  important  to

keep  in  mind  as  were  going  through  and

creating  this  design  you  want  to  make

sure  you  keep  everything

in  this  white  space  in  here  now  as  you

can  see  over  here  on  the  right

we  have  the  cover  of  the  book  the  front

cover  over  here  on  the  left  we  have  the

back  cover

and  this  right  here  is  the  spine  of  the

book  now  the  way  this  works  is  this  will

be  printed  out  as  one

entire  document  and  then  just  wrapped

around  the  book  as  a  single

a  single  piece  of  paper  and  then  over

here  we  have

the  barcode  now  when  were  designing  we

want  to  make  sure  we  do  not  put  anything

over  here  we  do  not  need  to  put  the

barcode  on  the  design  ourselves  amazon

will  handle  that  themselves  all  we  have

to  do

is  make  sure  that  we  leave  this  space

right  here  free

so  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  let  me

open  up  the  layers  menu

which  is  located  over  here  you  can  also

press  shift  control  l  as  a  keyboard

shortcut

and  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to

rename  this  layer  to

template  and  i  want  to  create  a  new

layer

by  clicking  the  plus  button  over  here

and  i  want  to  name  this  contents

all  of  the  contents  the  design  is  going

to  be  on  this  layer  i  want  to  put  this

below  current

and  click  add  so  we  have  the  contents

layer  where  the  design  is  going  to  be

and  then  we  have  the  template  layer  up

here  which  were  going  to  use  for  a

reference  as  were  creating  our  design

now  instead  of  using  this  template  right

here  im  just  going  to  create  some

simple  guides  to  make  sure  that  im

staying  within  these  boundaries  here  so

the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is  let  me

grab  the  rectangles  tool

and  im  going  to  create  a  rectangle

going  over  the  white  space  right  here

of  the  back  cover  and  i  want  to  give

that  an  outline  um

or  a  stroke  im  going to  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  color  green  to  give  that

an  outline  let  me  remove  the  fill  color

let  me  grab  the  select  tool

im  going  to  be  moving  through  these

steps  a  little  quicker  than  normal  this

is  going  to  be  more  of  like  an

intermediate  tutorial  because

theres  a  lot  for  me  to  go  over  in  this

lesson  so  im  not  going  to  be  explaining

every  single  click  like  i  normally  do  so

thats  something  to  keep  in  mind

let  me  zoom  in  over  here  i  want  to  make

sure  i  have  this  option  up  here  disabled

where  it  says  when  scaling  objects  scale

the  stroke  width  by  the  same

proportion  have  that  turned  off  and  i

just  want  to  make  sure

that  the  edge  of  this  green  stroke  is

resting  on  the  edge

of  this  white  safe  space  right  here

there  we  go  looking  pretty  good  and

again  to  zoom  in  and  out  holding  control

rolling  up  and  down  the  mouse  wheel  to

move  the  page  around  pressing  down  the

mouse  wheel  and  moving  the  mouse

i  want  to  create  another  one  going  over

this  barcode  right  here

there  we  go

im  going  to  grab  the  select  tool

duplicate  that  by  pressing  ctrl  d

im  going  to  move  this  over  here  like

that

and  then  ill  create  another  one  for  the

spine  control  d  to  duplicate  it  move

this  one  over  here

there  we  go  and  ill  just  resize  that  to

fit

the  uh  i  want  to  make  sure  it  fits  the

spine  right  there

okay  looking  pretty  good  okay  let  me

just  zoom  out

okay  looking  pretty  good  here  weve  got

uh  green  strokes  for  all  of  the

important  areas

what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to  select

this  image  the  template  and  i  want  to

right  click  it  and  go  to  copy

and  then  i  want  to  turn  off  the

visibility  of  the  templates  layer  i  want

to  come  down  here  to  the  contents  layer

and  i  want  to  create  another  rectangle

so  just  create  a  rectangle  like  that

give  this  a  fill  color  im  going  to  make

this  as  you  can  see  in  the  thumbnail

design  i  made  this  book  cover

yellow  with  some  white  going  through

here  so  im  going to  make  this  yellow

the  cover  out  the  color  i  want  the  book

cover  to  be

ill  make  that  yellow  let  me  get  rid  of

that  stroke  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  the  x

and  i  want  to  make  this  the  same  size  as

the  template  that  we  just  copied  so  to

do  that

let  me  go  to  edit  paste  size  paste  size

and  itll  paste  the  width  and  height  of

that  image  like  that

and  then  i  just  want  to  align  this  on

the  artboard  here  or  the  canvas  so  let

me  open  up  the  alignment  menu  over  here

ctrl  shift  a  is  the  keyboard  shortcut

and  im  going  to  align  this  relative  to

the  page  im  going  to  put  that  on  the

vertical  and  horizontal  axis  like  that

okay  now  well  come  back  over  here  to

the  layers  menu  now  that  we  have  that  in

place

we  can  select  the  template  layer  turn

the  visibility  of  that  back  on

and  what  i  want  to  do  is  take  this

template  and  we  dont  need  this  anymore

you  could  just  press  delete  on  your

keyboard  and  get  rid  of  that

and  as  you  can  see  we  have  the  book

cover  design  which  is  the  yellow

rectangle

with  these  guides  in  place  to  let  us

know  where  the  important  content  should

go

and  where  we  should  not  be  putting  any

content  so  let  me

lock  this  layer  so  that  i  dont

accidentally

move  any  of  these  guides  as  im

designing  and  there  we  go  now  im  going

to  click  on  the  contents  layer

and  now  we  are  ready  to  start  designing

so  as  you  can  see  here  this  book  cover

is

yellow  and  i  have  some  white  in  there  so

im  going  to  go  ahead  and  create  that

aspect  of  it  real  quick  let  me

take  this  image  right  here  and  duplicate

that  by  pressing  ctrl  d

and  im  going  to  make  this  white  and  im

just  going  to  scale  this  down  like  this

kind  of  like  that  now  im  going to  grab

my  text  tool

and  im  going  to  put  some  text  in  here

im  going  to  write

how  to  create  a

now  let  me  change  the  font  im  going  to

go  to  text  text  and  font

and  the  font  im  looking  for  is

montserrat  obviously  you  can  use

whatever  font  youd  like  im  just

showing  you  how  i  created  this  specific

design  im  going  to  apply  that  font  like

that

let  me  scale  that  up  im  holding  ctrl

while  i  scale  to  lock  the  proportions

place  this  right  about  there  and  im

going  to  duplicate  that  control  d

bring  that  down  there  and  im  going  to

change

this  to  with  inkscape

and  the  text  in  the  middle  here  is  going

to  be  a  different  font  let  me  just  make

sure  i  have  this  centered  up  first  im

going  to  select  both  of  these

come  back  over  here  to  the  align

distribute  menu  and  set  this  to

last  selected  and  just  make  sure  i  have

that  centered  up  like  that

now  if  you  notice  here  i  have  a  book

cover  design  in  the  middle  here  with  a

different  font  so  im  going to  go  ahead

and  create  that  next

let  me  grab  my  text  tool  again  im  going

to  write

book  cover  design

there  we  go  let  me  change  the  font  of

that  to

sirona  make  sure  i  have  that

centered  and  im  just  going  to  scale

that  up  as  well

im  actually  going  to  move  this  out  of

the  way  i  want  to  make  this  i  want  this

title  to  take  up  the  whole  width  of  this

of  this  uh  of  this  cover  right  here  just

like  that

let  me  center  that  up  on  there

and  let  me  just  change  this  white  stripe

right  here  to  accommodate  the  change

in  the  size  of  the  text  like  that  let  me

move  this  up

move  this  up  now  if  you  notice  over  here

i  also  have  these  little  white  stripes

on  the  top  and  bottom  of  each  of  them  so

what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

duplicate  that

ctrl  d  move  this  over  here  like  this

and  just  bring  down  the  height  of  that

and  ill  just  duplicate  that  and  bring

that  up  there

and  i  want  to  make  sure  that  all  three

of  these  white  stripes  are

spaced  out  apart  evenly  so  im  going  to

hold  shift  and  click  on  each  of  them

come  over  here  to  align  and  distribute

and  click  on  where  it  says

make  vertical  gaps  between  objects  equal

there  we  go

and  now  i  just  want  to  align  my  text

again  to  make  sure  that  its  aligned

after  that  change  right  there  and  im

just  trying  to  make  sure  that  this  is

centered

like  that  im  going  to  take  this  text

and  this  text

select  them  both  and  then  center  it  up

with  this  text  just  to  make  sure  that

everything  is  aligned

in  the  center  like  that  let  me  move  that

up

there  we  go  okay  so  what  im  going to  do

next

is  down  here  all  of  the  secrets  of  book

cover  design  revealed

and  then  by  author  name  let  me  add  that

text  in  there  real  quick

and  im  going  to  give  this  text  a  little

bit  of  a  shear  by  clicking  on  it  again

and  getting  these  shearing  handles  just

to  make  it  look  like  its  italics

because  theres  no  italics  version  of

this  font

let  me  just  do  that  there  we  go  and  i

want  to  make  sure  i  have  that  centered

right  there

there  we  go  and  then  down  here  finally  i

have

by  author  name  this  is  where  you  put

your  author  right  here  so  let  me

im  just  going  to  use  this  text  item

right  here  im  going  to  duplicate  that

by  author  name  and  ill  make  this  one

smaller  because  this  one  is  less

less  prominent  there  we  go  put  that  down

there

towards  the  bottom  center  that  up  i  want

to  make  sure  i  have  everything  centered

up  here  so  im  going  to  click  on

click  and  drag  over  all  of  that  make

sure  its  all  centered  up  like  that

and  i  want  to  make  sure  its  all

centered  relative  to  the  page  there

and  what  i  might  want  to  do  is  just

space  things  out  vertically  a  little

better  so  let  me  move  this  down

let  me  move  this  down  im  going  to  group

all  of  this  right  here  together

im  going  to  just  press  ctrl  g  to  group

that  together  like  that

move  this  down  like  this  now  if  you  can

see  here

i  have  the  um  the  inkscape  logo  up  top

there  so  let  me  import  that  in  here  and

place  that  real  quick

okay  so  there  we  go  theres  the  inkscape

logo  and  now  im  just  going  to  select

all  of  these  objects  or  actually  you

know  what  let  me  make  sure  i  have  this

centered  first

there  we  go  im  going  to  select  all  of

these  objects

and  i  just  want  to  space  them  all  apart

evenly  vertically  like  this

there  we  go  and  maybe  move  that  up  a

little  bit

all  right  were  looking  pretty  good  here

okay  so  what  im  going to  do  now  is  the

cover  of  the  book

is  now  finished  im  going  to  work  on  the

spine  now  as  you  can  see  in  the  spine

i  have  the  inkscape  logo  i  have  the

author  name  i  have  the  title

and  then  i  have  some  subtext  over  here

so  let  me  add  that  in  here

let  me  put  the  escape  logo  in  there  im

going  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing  ctrl

d

i  have  to  make  this  small

there  we  go  put  that  right  about  there

and  im  going  to  put  some  text  right

here  that  says  the  author  name

let  me  just  duplicate  this  text  and  move

it  over  here

and  just  rotate  that  around  like  that  so

that  it  fits  in  there

you  may  have  to  scale  it  down  a  bit  like

that  there  we  go

now  im  going  to  put  the  book  title  in

this  white  space  right  here  so  im  going

to  duplicate

first  let  me  ungroup  that  im  going  to

duplicate  this  design  right  here  im

going  to

duplicate  this  text  right  here  and  i

want  to  put  this  text  all  on  one  line

like  that

oops  scale  that  down

rotate  that  place  this  in  here

and  scale  this  down  so  that  it  doesnt

it  doesnt  touch  the  green  edges  right

here  you  want  to  make  sure  its  well

within  that  safe  area

and  then  just  center  that  up  there  we  go

looking  pretty  good

now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

put  some  subtext  down  here

uh  let  me  just  duplicate  this

the  secrets  im  going  to  im  going  to

abbreviate  this  text  so  that  it  doesnt

take  up  too  much  space  down  here

the  secrets  of  book  cover  design  lets

see  if  that  works

okay  looking  pretty  good  alright  so  now

the  spine  is  finished

the  final  step  would  be  to  work  on  the

back  cover  of  the  book

so  im  going  to  put  some  text  up  there

some  placeholder  text  in  the  middle  and

then  about  the  author

uh  down  there  at  the  bottom  so  well  go

ahead  and  get  started  on  that

i  have  up  here  learn  how  to  design  book

covers  okay  so  im  going  to  grab

this  text  im  going  to  duplicate  that

put  this  over  here  ill  make  this  a

little  smaller

let  me  uh  change  this  learn  how  to

did  i  have  that  on  two  lines  or  one  line

learn  how  to

design  book  covers  okay  learn  how  to

design  book  covers

perfect  ill  scale  that  down

and  now  im  going  to  put  some

placeholder  text  in  here  some  lorem

ipsum  text  you  would  obviously  want  to

write  like  a  description  of  the  book  or

something

this  is  just  a  tutorial  so  im  going  to

put  some  lorem  if  some  text  in  there

ill  go  to  extensions  render

and  actually  no  extensions  text  and

lorem  ipsum  and  i  want  to  choose

two  paragraphs  six  sentences  per

paragraph

and  four  for  the  paragraph  im  just

putting  random  numbers  in  here

let  me  close  out  of  that  and  this  text

pretty  small  i  got  it  was  generated  over

here  in  the  top  left  corner  so  let  me

let  me  grab  that  place  this  in  here  let

me  go  to  the  text  editor

let  me  select  the  text  with  the  text

tool

and  i  want  to  change  this  to  montserrat

i  want  to  make  this  uh  medium  or

semi-bold

make  this  a  little  bigger  maybe  28

see  how  that  looks  maybe  a  little  bigger

than  that

36.  looking  better

okay  thats  good  enough  ill  leave  it  at

36.  ill  place  this  over  here  towards

the  top  left

again  making  sure  its  not  its  not

going  anywhere  near  that  green  border

let  me  go  back  to  the  text  tool  and  im

just  going  to  take  this  little  node

right  here  and  bring  that

in  so  that  it  forces  the  text  within

this  area  right  here

and  then  i  will  center  align  that  text

and  just  to  uh  let  me  bring  this  down  a

little  bit

there  we  go  just  to  make  this  look  a

little  better  im  going  to  add  some

spacing  between  these  lines  because

something  about  this  text  right  here  is

just  not  visually  appealing  it  just

looks  like  a  cluster  of  text  so

i  want  to  space  this  out  a  little  bit

let  me  grab  the  text  tool

select  that  and  over  here  uh  spacing

between  baselines  im  just  gonna

increase  that

there  we  go  that  looks  a lot  better  okay

now  down  here

bottom  left  we  have  about  the  author  and

some  more  lorem  ipsum

text  so  lets  go  ahead  and  create  that

and  then  well  be  done  so  let  me  take

this  text  let  me  duplicate  that

and  then  ill  just  take  this  text  over

here  and  just  duplicate  that  ill  put

this  down  here

let  me  go  back  to  the  text  tool  im

going  to  give  this  im  going  to  align

this  to  the  left

there  we  go  ill  bring  this  in  like  this

and  i  want  to  make  this  text  smaller

this  is  less  prominent  if  youre

following

the  rules  of  visual  hierarchy  here  this

here  is  the  most  prominent  this  is

secondary  and  then  this  is

uh  down  here  the  least  important  text

let  me  uh

shrink  that  down  let  me  try  24.

see  how  that  looks  okay  that  looks

pretty  good

im  gonna  get  rid  of  some  of  these  lines

of  text  in  here  so  that  its  not

bleeding  out  into  the  uh  the  bleed  cut

off

um  there  we  go

and  if  you  want  you  could  add  like  a

little  picture  right  here  a  picture  of

the  author  and

you  know  whatever  else  you  want  to  add

in  there  okay  so  the  design  portion  of

the  book  cover  is  finished

okay  so  how  do  we  go  from  here  to  having

an  actual  file  that  we  can  send  to  the

printers  and  have  printed

what  we  want  to  do  first  is  come  over

here  to  the  layers  menu  and  where  it

says  template  we  want  to  just  turn  off

the  visibility  of  that  layer  we  dont

need  that  anymore

and  what  we  want  to  do  now  is  export

this  as  a  jpeg  image  so  well  go  to  file

and  well  go  to  export  png  image  its

labeled  as  png  image  but  it  also  allows

you  to  export  other  formats  such  as  jpg

if  youre  working  with  inkscape  version

1.1  or  later  so  lets  open  up  the  export

menu

and  i  want  to  leave  all  of  the  defaults

as  they  are  the  export  area  we  are

exporting  the  page

and  just  leave  all  of  these  defaults  as

they  are  and  then  just  go  ahead  and

click  on  export  as  and  when  you  click  on

that  its  gonna  its  gonna  ask  you  to

choose  a  location  on  your  hard  drive  to

save  this  file  to

and  its  also  going  to  ask  you  to  its

also  going  to  ask  you  to  choose  a  file

format

now  for  this  probably  a  good  idea  to

choose  jpeg

so  um  yeah  whenever  youre  printing

something  jpeg  is  always  better  than  png

and  once  you  save  that  file  you  should

be  done  you  should  be  able  to  take  that

file  that  jpeg  file  that  youve  exported

and  upload  it  to  kindle  direct

publishing

to  have  your  book  cover  printed  so  i

think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go  about

designing  your  own  book  covers

using  inkscape  if  you  have  any  questions

just  leave  a  comment  below  and  as  always

thanks  for  watching
