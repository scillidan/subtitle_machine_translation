in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  using  path

effects  and  inkscape  to  show  you  how  you

can  add  these  decorative  elements  to

your  text  known  as  swashes  and  to  follow

along  with  what  Im  doing  here  youll

need  to  download  and  install  this  font

which  I  will  have  Linked  In  the

description  below  so  lets  get  started

uh  Im  going  to  grab  my  text  tool  and

Im  going  to  write  on  the  canvas  swashes

just  for  this  demonstration  and  Im

going  to  open  up  my  text  editor  so  let

me  grab  my  text  menu  and  Im  going  to

look  for  that  font  that  I  already  have

installed  click  apply

and  Im  going  to  scale  this  up  a  little

bit  Im  going  to  hold  control  while  Im

doing  that  so  that  it  locks  the

proportions  and  preserves  the  aspect

ratio  and  what  I  will  do  now  is  I  will

convert  this  to  a  path  so  Ill  go  I  will

go  to  path  object  to  path  and  Ill  split

the  letters  apart  so  I  will  go  to  path

and  choose  split

path  and  now  it  is  individual  letters  so

what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  use

the  pencil  tool  to  manually  draw  lines

coming  off  of  these  letters  here  to  show

you  what  I  mean  uh  I  was  able  to  draw  a

line  that  comes  off  the  top  of  this

letter  H  and  swoops  underneath  like  that

uh  we  can  do  that  with  the  pencil  tool

by  just  drawing  a  regular  plain  line  and

then  were  going  to  use  path  effects  to

make  the  line  look  like  its  consistent

with  the  style  of  the  text  so  Im  going

to  grab  the  P  the  pencil  tool  over  here

you  can  access  it  by  pressing  the  letter

P  on  the  keyboard  Im  going  to  use  the

regular  mode  the  standard  uh  regular

mode  for  this  what  Im  doing  here  and

then  over  here  where  it  says  smoothing

Im  going  to  set  that  to  50  for  now  you

may  have  to  adjust  this  based  on  the

size  of  your  text  on  your  screen  so  Im

going  to  start  with  those  settings  and

Im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  to  draw

a  line  like  this  that  swoops  around  and

goes  under  the  text  like  that  and  what

you  can  do  now  is  you  can  grab  your

nodes  tool  and  adjust  to  these  nodes  so

that  it  looks  a  little  more  smooth  you

may  have  to  delete  nodes  if  you  have  too

many  of  them  if  you  drew  like  a  very

shaky  line  uh  like  the  fewer  nodes  you

have  the  smoother  of  a  line  you  get  so

Im  going  to  try  deleting  some  of  these

nodes  and  seeing  if  that  gives  me  a

better  result  so  Im  just  going  to

adjust  this  a  little  bit

and  the  idea  here  is  that  you  want  this

line  going  consistent  with  the  direction

of  this  part  of  the  letter  H  so  you  want

this  to  be  nice  and  consistent  so  let  me

adjust  this  a  little

more  and  Im  happy  with  how  that  looks

what  Im  going  to  do  now  is  Im  going  to

adjust  this  a  little  bit  so  Ill  grab  my

selection  tool  Im  going  to  move  this  up

a  little  bit  and  I  may  even  rotate  this

around  a  tiny  bit  as  well  just  so  it  has

more  of  a  uh  consistent  Direction  there

and  now  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  grab  the  power  stroke  path

effects  let  me  open  up  my  path  effects

menu  by  going  to  path  and  selecting  path

effects  and  Im  going  to  look  for  Power

Stroke  so  Ill  just  type  in  pwe  and

there  it  is  right  there  power  stroke  and

with  power  stroke  applied  I  can  grab  my

nodes  tool  and  youll  see  these  pink

handles  now  on  the  path  once  you  apply

the  power  stroke  and  you  can  use  these

pink  handles  to  change  the  width  of  the

line  at  that  particular  point  so  Im

going  to  make  this  line  a  little  more

consistent  with  this  part  of  the  letter

H  if  you  notice  here  theres  a  little

bit  of  a  like  a  little  bit  of  a  corner  a

little  bit  of  a  dip  dont  worry  about

that  were  going  to  go  correct  that

later  were  just  looking  to  get  a

general  consistency  here  Im  going  to

take  this  node  and  change  this  as  well

you  may  notice  that  when  youre  doing

this  you  end  up  with  like  this  sort  of

effect  right  here  if  youre  doing  that

then  just  move  the  node  or  move  the

handle  back  to  the  other  side  of  the

line  and  you  should  have  a  better  result

and  Im  going  to  take  this  one  and  bring

this  one  out  like  that  or  I  may  have  to

bring  this  one

up  and  Ill  adjust  this  a  little  bit

and  the  good  thing  about  this  is  that

you  can  change  the  direction  of  your  uh

nodes  still  while  youre  doing  this  so

nothing  is  finalized  just  yet  so  let  me

zoom  out  and  see  how  this  looks  in

comparison  um  you  want  to  make  the  the

uh  weight  of  the  swashes  consistent  with

the  weight  of  the  letters  so  I  noticed

this  is  a  little  too  little  too  heavy  so

Ill  bring  that  down  a  little

bit  there  we  go  I  like  how  that  looks

right

there  and  Im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  now  and  Im  just  going  to  to  change

the  position  of  this  a  little  more  I  may

want  to  rotate  this  around  just  a  little

more  just  to  match  the  direction  of  that

letter  and  Ill  bring  this  down  some  a

little

bit  and  that  looks  pretty  good  I  think

Im  going  to  leave  that  just  as  it  is

and  Im  going  to  come  over  here  and  draw

another  one  now  so  let  me  come  over  here

to  my  pencil  tool  and  again  Im  going  to

follow  the  the  direction  of  the  letter

and  just  draw  my  line  you  may  have  to

try  a  couple  of  times  cuz  I  just  messed

that  one  up  right  there  Im  going  to

press  command  Z  or  control  Z  to  undo

that  and  try  again

okay  that  ones  a  little  better  Im

going  to  grab  my  nodes  tool  now  and  Im

going  to  delete  some  of  these  extra

nodes  in  here  like  I  dont  need  this  one

oops  let  me  try  that  again  I  dont  need

that

one  and  Im  going  to  adjust  these  ones  a

little

bit  okay  so  I  think  thats  looking  a  lot

better  now  like  I  mentioned  earlier  the

fewer  nodes  you  have  the  smoother  the

line  is  so  you  want  to  have  as  few  nodes

in  there  as  possible  so  now  that  thats

done  let  me  go  to  back  to  my  uh  path

effects  and  Im  going  to  apply  another

power

stroke  and  now  I  can  grab  my  nodes  tool

and  adjust  the  size  of  the  uh  or  adjust

the  weight  of  the

line  okay  so  let  me  grab  my  selection

tool  now  and  position  this  Ill  put  this

up  a  little

more  there  we  go  that  looks  a  lot  better

and  one  final  touch  Ill  add  here  is

Ill  add  another  swash  to  the  letter  W

so  let  me  repeat  that  same  process  Im

going  to  grab  my  pencil  tool  Ill  just

press  the  letter  P  on  the  keyboard  draw

my

line  and  now  I  will  just  reposition  this

one  as  well  okay  so  lets  address  the  um

these  little  Corners  that  show  up  these

little  inconsistencies  where  the  swashes

connect  with  the  letters  to  fix  that

what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

select  the  swash  and  then  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  select  the  letter  and  Im

just  going  to  unify  them  together  before

I  do  that  though  I  do  have  to  warn  you

that  once  you  do  this  this  effect  will

be  finalized  and  this  will  become  a

regular  path  you  wont  be  able  to  change

the  consistency  or  the  the  weight  of  the

line  or  the  direction  of  it  anymore

without  editing  the  nodes  uh  so  just  to

warn  you  there  make  sure  everything

looks  good  before  you  do  this  next  step

and  then  go  to  path

Union  and  now  what  Im  going  to  do  to

smooth  this  out  Im  just  going  to  grab

my  nodes  tool  and  Ill  just  go  in  there

and  delete  those  nodes  and  when  you

delete  those  nodes  you  can  take  these

handles  and  straighten  them  out  and  you

have  a  nice  a  nice  smooth  line  there  so

let  me  do  the  same  thing  over  here  Ill

delete  these  nodes  and  now  we  have  a

nice  smooth  line  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  over  here  Im  going  to  grab  my

selection  tool  Im  going  to  select  all

of  these  by  holding  shift  and  clicking

on  them  all  three  objects  go  to  path

Union  and  I  will  do  the  same  thing  over

here  Im  going  to  delete  these  nodes  out

of  here

now  one  final  thing  I  wanted  to  address

with  this  design  is  that  if  you  notice

the  tips  of  these  swashes  they  end  in

sharp  points  and  thats  not  consistent

with  the  rest  of  these  letters  these

letters  for  the  most  part  have  rounded

caps  on  them  so  what  Im  going  to  do  is

Im  going  to  grab  my  Eraser  and  erase

the  ends  of  these  uh  the  the  ends  of

these  points  so  theres  actually  a  few

ways  to  do  this  for  this  Im  just  using

the  Eraser  Im  going  to  grab  the  Eraser

tool  Im  going  to  set  the  width  to  20

okay  let  me  try  that  again  eraser  tool

set  the  width  to

20  and  Im  just  going  to  erase  off  part

of  this  letter  right  here  like

that  and  now  Im  going  to  grab  my  nodes

tool  Im  going  to  select  these  nodes  get

rid  of  them  select  all  these  nodes  in

the  middle  here  not  the  ones  on  the  ends

just  the  ones  in  the  middle  get  rid  of

them  and  then  we  can  take  this  line  or

take  these  nodes  and  pull  this  out  like

that  and  now  we  have  a  rounded  cap  on

there  like  I  said  theres  various  ways

to  do  this  you  can  draw  a  bezier  path

and  do  a  path  difference  and  then

reshape  it  this  way  but  this  is  just  the

way  Im  doing  it  for  this  tutorial  Im

just  using  the  Eraser  Ill  do  the  same

thing  over  here  you  have  to  select  the

object  first  then  grab  the  Eraser  and

then  you  can  draw  right  through  there

and  erase  that  off  so  Ill  just  go

through  and  erase  this

and  there  we  go  that  looks  a  lot  more

consistent  with  the  rest  of  the  letters

so  I  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  take  text

and  add  some  decorative  elements  known

as  swashes  to  it  using  path  effects  in

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

then  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want
