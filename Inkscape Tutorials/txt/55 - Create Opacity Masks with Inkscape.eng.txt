if  youre  familiar  with  how  gradients

work  in  inkscape  then  you  probably

already  know  that  you  can  take  an  object

and  give  it  partial  transparency

by  applying  a  gradient  like  that  now  as

you  can  see  the  left-hand  side  of  the

object  still  has  all  of  its  color

whereas  the  right-hand  side  slowly

transitions  to  transparency  what  if  you

wanted  to  do  the  same  thing  to  a  group

of  objects  though

well  if  you  select  your  group  of  objects

and  you  try  to  apply

a  gradient  the  same  way  you  end  up  with

something  like  this  right  here  its

pretty  safe  to  say  that  this  is  probably

not  the  effect  youre  going  for

so  how  would  you  go  about  applying

partial  transparency  to  this  group  of

objects  like  you  did  to  this  object

right  here

this  is  where  opacity  masks  will  come

into  play  and  thats  what  i  will  be

demonstrating  in  this  tutorial

this  is  nick  with  logosbynick.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  an  opacity  mask

using  inkscape  before  we  get  started

though  if  youd  like  to  learn  everything

that  there  is  to  know  about  inkscape

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over  every  tool  and

feature  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape  as

you  can  see  i  have  this  selection  of

objects  here  if  i

click  and  drag  over  all  of  them  this  is

uh  this  entire  design  consists  of  a

bunch  of  individual  objects

im  going  to  go  ahead  and  group  them

together  using  this  button  right  here

that  says  group  selected  objects

and  what  i  want  to  do  is  apply  an

opacity  mask  to  this

so  that  i  can  have  partial  transparency

so  to  do  that  let  me  first  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  which  is  over  here

you  can  click  on  this  or  you  can  go  to

object

fill  and  stroke  and  that  will  open  up

that  menu  right  here  okay

so  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

use  the  masking  feature  instead  of

applying  a  linear  gradient  like  i  would

with  an  individual  object

im  going  to  use  the  masking  feature

instead  okay  and  the  way

masking  works  is  that  you  take  an  object

and  you  apply  it  over  the  group  of

objects

and  whatever  whenever  the  object  is

black  it  becomes  transparent  on  the

group  of  objects  but  when  its  white  it

becomes  opaque

its  a  lot  easier  for  me  to  demonstrate

how  this  works  and  it  is  to  explain  it

so  let  me  go  ahead  and  do  that  im  going

to  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles  tool

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  to

create  a  rectangle  covering  the  entire

subject  here

and  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

make  this  black  and  im  going  to  give

this  a  linear  gradient  with  this  button

right  here

and  im  going  to  click  on  this  stop  on

the  right  hand  side  and  im  just  going

to  make  that  white  so  we  have  a  gradient

going  from  black

to  white  like  this  now  how  this  works  is

what  when  i  take

this  object  right  here  and  apply  it  as  a

mask

to  the  group  of  objects  beneath  it

whatever  is  black

will  become  transparent  and  whatever  is

white  will  remain  opaque

okay  so  let  me  show  you  what  i  mean  here

let  me  grab  the  select  tool

let  me  click  and  drag  over  both  of  these

objects  my  grouping  of  objects

as  well  as  the  mask  that  i  created  here

with  this  rectangle

i  can  go  to  object  mask

set  and  as  you  can  see  theres  some

partial  transparency  here

over  here  on  the  right  hand  side  was  the

color  white  so  this  is  more  visible

whereas  over  here  is  the  color  black  so

this  becomes  more  transparent

now  if  you  want  to  alter  this  further

you  can  go  to  object  mask

release  and  let  me  click  off  of  that  to

deselect  everything  let  me  click  on  just

this  object  right  here  and  im  going  to

grab  the  gradient  tool  which  is  right

here

and  im  going  to  move  this  white  stop  in

like  this  and  im  going  to  move  this

black  stop  in  like  this  and  im  holding

ctrl  when  i  do  this  to  lock  it  onto  the

horizontal  axis

now  if  i  go  back  to  the  select  tool  and

i  select  both  of  those  objects  and  go  to

object  mask  set  as  you  can  see

the  right  hand  side  of  this  is  more

visible  now  because  there  was  more  white

included  in  that

mask  whereas  the  left  hand  side  is  more

transparent  because  there  was  more

black  included  in  that  mask  and  a  tip

one  helpful  tip  for  how  you  can  go  about

adjusting  this  better  what  im  going  to

do  is  im  going  to  release  this

object  mask  release  what  you  can  do

is  you  can  take  this  object  right  here

and  bring  the  opacity  down  a little  bit

so  you  can  see  exactly  where  the  black

and  white  lines  up

so  if  i  take  that  and  i  go  back  to  the

gradient  tool  i  can  take  this  white  stop

and  put  it

directly  in  the  middle  like  this  and  i

can  take  this  black  stop  and  put  it

almost  next  to  it  like  that  and  now  what

i  can  do  is  go  back  to  the  select  tool

take  the  object  take  the  mask  and  bring

the  opacity  of  it  all  the  way  back  up

if  you  apply  the  mask  with  partial

transparency  youre  going  to  have

partial  opacity  in  your  object  which  is

not  what  youre  looking  for  so

make  sure  to  bring  that  opacity  all  the

way  back  up  click  and  drag  over

both  objects  object  mask

set  and  there  you  go  and  i  think  that

should  do  it  for  this  lesson  that  is  how

you  can  go  about  creating  an

opacity  mask  with  inkscape  and  by  the

way  this  doesnt  just  work  with  linear

gradients  this  can  work

with  a  radial  gradient  as  well  ill  show

you  that  real  quick  im  going  to  choose

a  radial  gradient

and  lets  go  ahead  and  apply  it  again

object  mask

set  and  as  you  can  see  the  center  where

the  black  was  became  transparent  where

the  outside

became  fully  opaque  one  last  thing  i

want  to  show  you  though  before  i  end

this  video

you  can  take  your  object  go  to  the

gradient  tool  and  you  can  click  on

i  believe  its  this  button  right  here

reverse  the  direction  of  the

gradient  lets  say  you  want  the  outside

to  be  black  and  the  inside  to  be  white

just  click  that  button  right  there  and

it  reverses  it  for  you

and  now  you  can  click  and  drag  over  both

of  it  go  to  object

mask  set  and  there  you  go  and  that

should  do  it  for  this  tutorial  that  is

how  you  can  go  about  easily  creating

an  opacity  mask  using  inkscape  if  you
