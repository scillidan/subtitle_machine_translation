so  as  you  may  already  know  you  can

change  the  colors  of  objects  in  inkscape

by  clicking  on  them  one  by  one  and

applying  fill  colors

but  what  if  you  wanted  to  change  an

entire  range  of  colors  all  at  once  so

that  you  get  a  more  consistent  result

like  this  while  saving  yourself  a  bunch

of  time

this  is  where  the  hsl  adjustment

extension  comes  in  handy  and  in  this

tutorial  well  be  going  over  how  you  can

use  it

so  to  get  started  I  have  this  example

design  here  on  my  canvas  it  just

consists  of  individual  Vector  objects

Im  going  to  click  and  drag  over  all  of

them  to  select  them  and  group  it  all

together  by  going  to  object  and

selecting  group

now  Im  going  to  open  up  my  extensions

menu  over  here  Ill  come  down  to  where

it  says  color  and  I  will  select  hsl

adjust

let  me  bring  this  menu  over  here  now  hsl

stands  for  Hue  saturation  and  lightness

to  show  you  how  this  works  let  me  turn

on  the  live  preview

first  Ill  show  you  what  saturation  and

lightness  does  and  then  I  will  explain

you  so  saturation  is  the  intensity  of

the  color  so  if  I  bring  this  all  the  way

up  we  have  more  vibrant  intense  colors

if  I  bring  this  all  the  way  down

the  colors  become  more  muted  and  if  I

bring  it  all  the  way  down  like  that  we

end  up  with  an  almost  or  a  black  and

white  image  as  you  can  see  there  in  that

grayscale

let  me  set  this  back  to  zero

lightness  represents  the  lightness  of

the  color  so  if  I  bring  this  up  we  end

up  with  the  lighter  result  like  that  or

if  I  bring  this  down  we  end  up  with  a

darker  result  like  that

so  let  me  reset  that  as  well

and  then  finally  Hue  is  what  you  would

use  to  change  the  actual  color  so  if  I

move  this  over  here

we  end  up  with  this  color  or  if  I  move

this  down  more  we  end  up  with  that  color

and  as  you  go  up  and  down  this  scale

here  you  can  run  through  the  entire

gamut  the  entire  range  of  colors  you  can

make  this  object  virtually  any  color

that  you  want  you  can  use  green  blue  or

whatever  and  the  thumbnail  of  the  video

I  used  a  pinkish  purple  so  I  will  use

something  like  that  right  there  and  then

you  can  if  you  want  to  you  can  change

the  saturation  to  increase  the  the

intensity  of  that  color

and  then  finally  over  here  you  can  use

your  lightness  to  adjust  that  if  you

want  I  think  this  looks  better

with  a  modest  lightness  like  that  and

once  youre  finished  click  the  apply

button  once  and  I  say  once  because  once

you  click  it  nothing  visibly  is  going  to

happen  on  your  screen  well  nothing

nothings  going  to  change  that  you  can

see  anyway  but  the  changes  are  now

applied  and  if  you  click  that  button

again  its  going  to  apply  those  changes

a  second  time  so  youll  end  up  with  a

different  result  so  thats  one  thing  to

keep  in  mind  click  that  button  once  and

once  you  click  it  close  out  of  the  menu

and  now  if  I  ungroup  these  objects  and

select  them  one  by  one  you  can  see  their

colors  have  indeed  been  changed  this  is

not  a  temporary  filter  or  some  kind  of

adjustment  layer  these  are  actual

changes  that  have  been  applied  to  the

subject  as  you  can  see  there

so  that  is  how  you  can  change  colors

globally  using  the  hsl  adjustment  in

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

then  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want
