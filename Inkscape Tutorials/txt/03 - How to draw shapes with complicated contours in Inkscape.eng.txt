in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  use  inkscape  to  draw  objects

that  have  a  complicated  Contour  to  them

and  a  good  example  of  this  would  be

these  eyeglass  frames  which  Ive  created

here  for  this  demonstration  so  Ill  be

showing  you  how  to  create  this  before  we

get  started  though  if  you  want  to  learn

more  about  how  inkscape  Works  be  sure  to

check  out  my  inkscape  master  class  its

a  collection  of  over  80  videos  where  I

go  over  every  tool  and  feature  in  this

software  and  I  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works  we  even  have  a

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  want  so  Ill  have  some  information

about  that  down  below  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  and  with  that  out  of  the

way  lets  get  started  so  let  me  move

this  out  of  the  way  and  Im  going  to  get

started  by  drawing  a  rectangle  so  Im

going  to  grab  my  squares  and  rectangles

tool  and  Im  going  to  draw  a  rectangle

and  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  and  I

want  to  size  this  rectangle  at  400x  200

pixels  so  for  the  width  Ill  put  in  400

and  then  for  the  height  Ill  put  in  200

now  we  want  to  convert  this  to  a  path  by

going  to  path  and  selecting  object  to

path  and  Im  going  to  zoom  in  on  this  a

little  bit  now  Im  going  to  grab  my

nodes  tool  and  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  over  these  two  nodes  right  here  to

select  both  of  them  and  I  want  to  enable

this  option  up  here  in  the  toolbar  that

says  show  transformation  handles  for

selected  nodes  Im  going  to  turn  that  on

and  thats  going  to  give  us

transformation  handles  for  these

selected  nodes  and  Im  going  to  hold

control  and  shift  and  Im  just  going  to

scale  these  two  nodes  in  about  this  far

now  if  you  look  at  the  bottom  left  of

the  screen  itll  show  you  how  much

youre  scaling  it  by  for  this

demonstration  Im  going  to  scale  it  by

about  70%  it  doesnt  have  to  be  exact

but  somewhere  thereabouts  is  good  enough

and  once  you  do  that  you  can  go  ahead

and  disable  this  setting  that  we  just

enabled  and  now  that  thats  done  Im

just  going  to  click  and  drag  this  top

Edge  right  here  to  give  this  a  nice

curved  contour  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  down  here  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  this  down  as  well  to  give  that  a

rounded  contour  and  maybe  Ill  bring

that  up  a  little  more  and  Ill  do  the

same  thing  over  here  on  the  side  edges

of  the  glass  frame  or  the  eyeglass

frame  so  now  were  going  to  take  these

corners  and  make  them  rounded  so  Im

going  to  come  up  here  to  the  toolbar  and

Im  going  to  select  this  option  right

here  that  says  add  corner  LP  and  once

you  do  that  click  and  drag  over  all  four

nodes  right  there  and  were  going  to

take  this  rounded  node  and  bring  that  in

and  as  you  can  see  as  I  do  that  its

rounding  the  corner  of  those  nodes  now

right  about  there  looks  good  once  I  do

that  Im  going  to  click  on  just  this

node  right  here  and  Im  going  to  make

this  one  a  little  extra

rounded  and  that  right  there  is  about

the  effect  were  going  for  so  Im  going

to  finalize  this  now  by  coming  back  up

here  to  the  toolbar  and  selecting  this

option  that  says  object  to  path  when  you

hover  your  cursor  over  it  click  on  that

and  now  weve  converted  that  to  a  path

so  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  zoom

out  a  bit  and  now  Im  going  to  turn  this

from  a  solid  object  into  a  uh  like  an

eyeglass  frame  so  to  do  that  Im  going

to  first  make  this  a  lighter  shade  of

gray  and  then  Im  going  to  go  to  path

and  I  will  select  linked  path  or  linked

offset  and  thats  going  to  create

another  copy  of  it  behind  it  so  I  want  I

want  to  make  that  other  copy  black  so

let  me  click  on  black  and  Im  going  to

take  this  node  and  bring  this  out  about

that  far  we  want  this  Noe  to  be  about

that  far  and  that  right  right  about

there  looks  good  and  I  will  click  this

button  again  that  says  object  to  path

now  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  gray  object  in

the  middle  so  that  we  have  them  both

selected  and  were  going  to  subtract

them  from  each  other  by  going  to  path

and  selecting  difference  and  once  you  do

that  lets  come  over  here  to  the  fill

and  stroke  menu  if  you  dont  have  your

fill  and  stroke  menu  open  just  come  down

here  to  the  fill  and  just  double  click

that  and  it  should  open  over  here  on  the

right  hand  side  and  I  want  to  take  this

and  bring  the  opacity  down  roughly  in

half  and  once  thats  done  lets  right

click  on  this  and  go  to  duplicate  and

Im  going  to  hold  control  and  bring  this

object  over  here  to  the  left  like

that  and  Im  going  to  zoom  in  on  this

right  here  and  the  reason  why  I  made

them  halfway  transparent  is  because  I

want  to  see  where  they  line  up  I  want  to

take  this  object  and  Im  holding  control

the  whole  time  I  do  this  to  lock  it  onto

the  horizontal  axis  and  I  want  to

overlap  overlap  this  object  about  that

far  and  you  can  see  the  area  where  they

overlap  right  about  there  and  Im  going

to  duplicate  this  object  again  Im  going

to  right  click  it  and  go  to  duplicate

and  Im  going  to  take  this  copy  and  put

it  up  here  and  I  want  to  zoom  in  and  I

want  to  make  this  object  if  Im  looking

right  about  here  I  want  it  to  intersect

with  the  other  object  right  about  there

and  where  Im  going  with  this  is  Im

going  to  create  an  object  from  this

empty  space  in  here  and  Im  going  to  use

that  as  sort  of  like  the  uh  the  edge  of

the  eyeglass  frame  there  so  once  thats

done  Im  going  to  position  that  right

about  there  you  may  want  to  try  to

visualize  what  this  Contour  looks  like

like  going  up  top  here  so  if  you  may

have  to  move  it  just  to  make  it  look

more  fluid  I  think  right  about  there

looks  pretty  good  if  it  doesnt  look

perfect  dont  worry  about  it  were  going

to  address  that  in  just  a  moment  so  let

me  move  this  in  just  a  little

more  and  once  thats  done  Im  going  to

select  all  of  these  so  let  me  click  and

drag  over  all  of  them  to  select  them  and

now  Im  going  to  go  into  my  shape

Builder  tool  which  is  over  here  Im

going  to  click  on  that  and  I  want  to

make  sure  I  have  the  addition  option

enabled  and  then  Im  going  to  click  on

this  object  right  here  and  then  this

object  right  here  and  its  going  to  make

them  into  separate  objects  and  now  I  can

go  back  to  my  selection  tool  and  now  I

have  that  as  a  separate  object  and  what

I  want  to  do  now  is  take  just  this

object  Im  going  to  make  this  red  just

so  I  can  differentiate  it  and  hold

control  and  shift  and  scale  this  up

about  that  far  we  want  this  to  be  a

little  bit  bigger  and  then  Im  going  to

bring  this  in  and  place  it  right  about

there  now  mine  looks  a  little  sloppy

theres  some  Jagged  edges  in  there  dont

worry  about  that  were  going  to  smooth

that  out  in  just  a  minute  the  idea  is  we

want  to  have  this  object  that  we  can

work  with  and  we  can  use  as  that  shape

for  the  edge  of  the  eyeglass  frame  so

let  me  move  that  out  a  little

more  and  once  thats  done  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  click  on  the  other

objects  so  we  have  them  both  selected

and  I  will  go  into  the  shape  Builder

tool  again  and  I  just  want  to  click

click  and  drag  a  line  going  through

those  just  to  unify  them  all  together

and  then  go  back  to  the  selection  tool

and  now  we  have  something  like  that

right  there  so  now  that  thats  set  lets

go  to  our  nodes  tool  and  lets  go  in

here  and  clean  this  up  so  if  you  notice

over  here  we  have  a  bunch  of  nodes

thats  whats  giving  it  that  uneven  look

Im  Im  going  to  take  these  three  nodes

over  here  to  the  left  and  Im  going  to

press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get  rid

of  them  and  you  should  be  able  to  take

this  handle  right  here  and  just  jiggle

it  bit  and  youll  see  it  straightens  out

so  we  have  a  nice  straight  fluid  line

and  then  Ill  take  this  handle  over  here

and  just  straighten  that  out  a  little

bit  we  want  a  nice  fluid  curve  going

through  there  and  then  Im  going  to  do

the  same  thing  over  here  if  you  notice

theres  an  extra  node  in  here  if  theres

any  extra  nodes  get  rid  of  them  you  only

want  one  node  there  and  then  Im  going

to  take  this  handle  and  bring  that  out  I

want  to  make  this  handle  so  that  its

going  parallel  with  the  other  handle  or

the  other  side  of  the  handle  and  once  it

looks  about  parallel  you  can  hold  the

control  key  and  then  click  the  node  and

then  itll  make  it  automatically  smooth

and  Im  going  to  take  this  and  bring

that  in  a  little  bit  so  it  gives  it  more

of  a  swoop  and  now  Im  going  to  cut  off

this  little  corner  right  here  so  let  me

grab  my  pen  tool  which  is  located  over

here  Im  going  to  click  to  add  a  point

hold  the  control  button  bring  the  line

straight  down  click  to  add  another  point

and  then  add  some  more  points  going

around  the  outside  and  then  connect  it

back  to  the  starting  point  and  Im  just

going  to  bring  this  in  a  little

more  right  about  there  looks  good  and

then  Ill  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

object  so  that  we  have  them  both

selected  and  once  again  well  go  to  path

and  select  difference  and  now  we  have

that  little  Notch  there  on  the  left  hand

side  Im  going  to  shape  this  up  a  little

more  let  me  go  back  to  my  nodes  tool  Im

going  to  grab  this  left  Edge  right  here

and  pull  that  out  a  little  bit  and  Im

going  to  round  these  Corners  just  a  tiny

bit  so  Im  going  to  come  back  up  here  to

the  add  Corners  live  path  effect  and  Im

going  to  select  just  those  two  corners

and  Ill  grab  this  round  knot  right  here

and  just  round  those  Corners  a  little

bit  about  that  much  looks  good  and  then

I  will  click  this  button  over  here  that

says  object  to  path  and  there  we  go  Im

going  to  select  Ju  Just  this  object

right  here  and  I  want  to  click  on  it

again  to  get  the  rotation  handles  and  I

want  to  rotate  this  clockwise  just  a

couple  of  degrees  just  to  give  it  a

little  bit  of  a

tilt  about  that  much  looks  good  okay  so

now  Ill  uh  duplicate  it  Ill  right

click  and  go  to  duplicate

hold  control  bring  this  over  to  the

right  and  then  I  want  to  flip  this

horizontally  to  do  that  Im  just  going

to  press  the  letter  H  on  my  keyboard  and

its  going  to  flip  it  horizontally  and

then  Ill  just  move  this  over  a  little

more  just  to  space  it  out  you  want  to

eyeball  about  how  far  apart  these  uh

lenses  should

be  I  think  right  about  there  looks  good

and  then  Im  going  to  draw  a  rectangle

going

through  the  uh  space  between  these  two

objects  so  let  me  grab  my  rectangle  tool

and  Im  going  to  click  and  drag  to  draw

a  rectangle  going  through  there  and  Im

going  to  grab  my  selection  tool  I  want

to  make  sure  that  the  bottom  of  the

rectangle  ends  where  this  curve  before

this  curve  begins  over  here  so  if  its

up  here  its  about  too  high  because  this

curve  is  already  beginning  I  want  to

bring  it  down  here  about  that  far  where

we  still  have  a  little  bit  of  a  straight

edge  there  and  up  here  I  want  to  bring

this  up  a  little  bit  maybe  about  that

far  the  placement  up  here  isnt  as

important  as  long  as  its  somewhere

thereabouts  it  should  be  pretty  good  and

now  I  will  select  everything  here  and  go

into  my  shape  Builder  tool  and  Im  just

going  to  draw  a  line  going  through  all

of  these  objects  here  to  make  them  one

single  object  go  back  to  the  selection

tool  and  now  were  going  to  shape  this

up  so  that  it  looks  like  this  over  here

what  its  supposed  to  look  like  so  to  do

that  let  me  grab  my  nodes

tool  I  want  to  select  these  two  nodes

right  here  and  I  want  to  add  a  new  node

in  the  middle  so  to  do  that  Im  going  to

come  over  here  to  this  button  at  the  top

left  corner  that  says  insert  new  nodes

and  click  on  that  and  Ill  take  just

that  node  Im  going  to  click  on  just

that  node  and  hold  control  and  bring

that  down  and  I  want  to  make  this  into  a

symmetrical  node  so  Ill  come  back  up

here  to  the  toolbar  and  I  want  to  select

this  option  that  says  make  selected  node

symmetric  and  thats  going  to  give  us

this  symmetrical  node  with  these  handles

that  move  in  and  out  uh  the  same  way

then  I  want  to  select  this  node  over

here  hold  shift  select  this  node  over

here  so  that  we  have  them  both  selected

and  Ill  press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to

get  rid  of  those  nodes  and  if  you  notice

were  starting  to  get  a  little  bit  of  a

we  have  a  nice  fluid  dip  in  here  so  let

me  move  this  up  a  little  more  and  Im

going  to  move  this  handle  out  Im  going

to  hold  control  while  I  do  this  to  keep

it  on  its  axis  and  Ill  move  this  one

out  about  the  same

distance  and  then  I  want  to  take  this

one  and  just  bring  that  in  a  little  bit

and  if  I  go  back  to  my  selection  tool

and  click  off  of  it  you  can  see  uh  how

it  looks  it  looks  pretty  fluid  but  it

could  look  a  little  better  so  Im  going

to  take  this  and  bring  that  up  a  little

more  that  should  help  it  look  a  little

more  even  okay  that  looks  better  and  now

Im  just  going  to  use  Im  going  to  use

the  nodes  tool  again  to  take  this  bottom

Edge  and  just  bring  this  up  like  that

and  to  straighten  this  out  Im  going  to

click  on  this  node  take  this  handle  and

bring  this  straight  up  or  not  straight

up  but  going  up  at  the  angle  it  want  you

want  it  to  match  the  angle  of  the  edge

of  this  Frame  right  here  so  Ill  bring

that  up  about  that  far  and  then  I  want

to  take  this  node  or  this  handle  and  do

the  same  thing  we  want  to  bring  it  up

about  just  as  high  and  again  we  want  to

use  the  same  angle  as  the  frame  right

there  and  if  I  zoom  out  you  can  see  we

are  finished  I  can  take  the  opacity  and

bring  it  up  to  100%  And  as  you  can  see

we  have  created  those  eyeglass  frames

with  those  really  complicated  Contours

using  inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson

useful  then  consider  checking  out  my

inkscape  master  class  its  a  collection

of  over  60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of

the  tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  for  me  anytime  you  want  and

best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  $17  one

time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill  have

some  information  about  that  down  below
