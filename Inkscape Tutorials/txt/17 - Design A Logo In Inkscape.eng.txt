in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  create  this  simple  badge  style

logo  using  inkscape  so  Ill  come  over

here  into  a  new  document  and  get  started

the  first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  change

the  size  of  the  canvas  so  that  it  is  a

square  so  Im  going  to  open  up  document

Properties  by  pressing  control  shift  and

D  on  the  keyboard  if  youre  a  Mac  User

that  would  be  command  shift  d  and  I  want

to  change  the  width  and  the  height  so

that  theyre  equal  so  for  my  example

here  I  will  use  800  by  800  and  then  I

will  close  out  of  that  and  then  I  want

to  zoom  into  100  %  so  Im  going  to  press

one  on  the  keyboard  to  zoom  into  100%

and  now  Im  going  to  create  a  circle  to

place  in  the  middle  of  the  canvas  here

which  we  will  wrap  the  text  around  so

Im  going  to  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  Ill  click  and  drag  to

create  a  circle  Im  going  to  hold  the

control  key  while  I  do  that  so  its  nice

and  perfectly  round  and  Ill  make  it

about  that  big  relative  to  the  size  of

the  canvas  and  I  want  to  convert  this  to

a  path  so  Ill  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  object  and  I  will  go  to  no  Im

sorry  Ill  go  to  path  and  I  will  select

object  to  path  and  then  I  want  to  send

Center  this  directly  on  the  canvas  so  I

will  open  up  the  aligned  distribute  menu

by  going  to  object  and  selecting  aligned

distribute  and  from  this  drop  down  over

here  I  want  to  choose  page  and  now  that

we  are  aligning  this  relative  to  the

page  I  want  to  align  this  on  the

vertical  and  the  horizontal  axis  were

selecting  the  center  options  there  and

now  its  perfectly  uh  centered  on  the

canvas  like  that  so  now  Im  going  to

create  some  text  to  put  on  the  circle

let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  first  Im

gon  to  adjust  the  size  of  this  a  little

bit  Im  going  to  hold  control  and  shift

and  scale  this  down  a  little  bit  because

the  text  is  going  to  be  placed  up  here

and  then  down  here  as  well  so  I  want  to

leave  some  room  around  the  edges  of  the

canvas  so  that  I  have  enough  room  for

that  and  now  Im  going  to  create  the

text  to  be  placed  on  the  circle  here  so

Ill  grab  the  text  tool  which  is  located

over  here  and  I  will  click  on  the  canvas

to  create  some  text  Im  going  to  write

for  this  demonstration  Im  just  going  to

write  inkscape  for  the  top  line  of  text

were  going  to  create  two  different  text

items  one  for  the  top  line  that  goes

along  the  top  of  the  circle  and  another

text  item  that  goes  along  the  bottom  so

Im  going  to  write  inkscape  here  Im

going  to  change  this  font  to  something

else  Im  going  to  go  to  text  and  select

text  and  font  and  from  this  editor  I

will  choose  a  different  font  to  work

with  you  can  work  whatever  work  with

whatever  font  youd  like  for  this  uh

design  I  like  the  monserat  font  uh  which

is  a  free  font  if  you  want  to  download

and  install  that  otherwise  you  can  use

whatever  font  youd  like  and  now  I  want

to  put  some  spacing  between  these

letters  so  let  me  come  up  here  to  where

it  says  spacing

and  I  want  to  add  this  I  want  to  add

like  three  to  this  value  Ill  try  Ill

start  off  with  three  and  then  well  take

it  from  there  and  we  want  to  make  sure

that  this  text  is  centered  so  come  over

here  to  the  alignment  option  and  Center

it  like  that  now  its  not  going  to

visibly  change  but  its  important  for

what  were  going  to  do  next  placing  it

on  the  circle  so  let  me  grab  my

selection  tool  now  Im  just  going  to

bring  the  text  over  here  to  the  circle

and  just  try  to  eyeball  the  size  of  it

as  it  is  right  now  its  going  to  be

wrapped  around  the  top  side  of  this

circle  so  you  may  want  to  make  it  a

little  bigger  or  smaller  depending  on

the  size  of  your  circle  and  Im  holding

in  control  and  shift  while  I  scale  like

this  so  it  scales  it  evenly  from  the

center  and  Ill  make  my  text  about  that

big  and  now  I  will  duplicate  this  I  will

right  click  it  and  go  to

duplicate  and  I  will  make  this  one  Ill

make  this  one  the  bottom  line  of  text

that  I  want  down  here  so  let  me  go  back

to  my  text  tool  and  I  will  change  this

one  to  logo

design  and  now  what  we  can  do  is  let  me

adjust  this  the  spacing  between  this  one

let  me  just  make  sure  thats  equal  okay

this  ones  a  little  larger  Im  going  to

adjust  this  I  want  to  make  sure  thats

even  for  both  of  these  I  want  both  of

these  to  be  the  same  amount  of

spacing  there  we

go  and  now  Im  going  to  take  this  text

item  right  here  Im  going  to  select  it

hold  shift  select  the  circle  and  with

them  both  selected  go  to  text  and  select

put  on  path  and  now  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything  and  then  click  on

just  the  circle  click  on  it  again  to  get

the  rotation  handles  and  then  hold  your

control  key  and  grab  the  rotation  handle

in  the  corner  then  there  and  rotate  it

around  until  the  text  is  upright  like

that  and  now  Im  going  to  change  the

color  of  this  so  let  me  make  this  a

lighter  shade  of  gray  something  like

that  so  I  just  so  I  can  see  the  text  a

little  better  up  against  the  uh  the

canvas  there  and  what  Ill  do  now  is  Im

going  to  create  another  Circle  for  the

bottom  line  of  text  so  let  me  deselect

that  by  clicking  off  of  it  let  me  move

this  out  of  the  way  Im  going  to  create

another  another  Circle  let  me  grab  my

circles  and  ellipses  tool  click  and  drag

to  create  a  circle  hold  the  control  key

and  I  want  this  circle  to  be  bigger  so

Ill  make  this  one  bigger  and  Ill  make

this  one  A  different  shade  that  from  the

other  Circle  Ill  make  this  one  maybe  a

darker  gray  and  then  Ill  take  this  one

I  want  to  lower  this  to  the  bottom  so

Ill  click  this  button  right  here  that

says  lower  to  the  bottom  and  Im  going

to  Center  this  on  the  page  as  well  so

let  me  come  back  over  here  to  my

alignment  menu  and  I  will  Center  this

vertically  and  horizontally  and  now  Im

going  to  scale  down  this  circle  Im

going  to  grab  this  Arrow  right  here  and

hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  it  down

until  the  top  of  the  circle  touches  the

top  of  that  line  of  text  right  there  and

now  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a  path

by  going  to  path  and  selecting  object  to

path  and  now  Im  going  to  grab  my  text

item  right  here  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  that  I  did  previously  Im  going  to

hold  shift  Im  going  to  click  on  the

larger  Circle  this  time  and  go  to  text

and  SE  select  put  on

path  click  off  of  it  to  deselect  select

just  the  large  Circle  click  on  it  again

to  get  the  rotation  handles  and  rotate

this  around  while  holding  control  until

its

upright  and  now  we  just  want  to  flip  the

circle  so  Im  going  to  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  flip  vertical  and  click  on

that  and  now  we  have  the  text  down  there

like  that  so  what  we  can  do  at  this

point  is  we  can  adjust  the  circles  to

make  sure  that  this  text  fills  up  as

much  area  as  we  want  it  to  fill  up  so  if

you  notice  right  now  theres  a  lot  of

empty  space  on  this  side  of  the  circle

on  both  sides  between  the  two  text  items

lets  say  you  want  to  close  that  in  a

bit  Im  going  to  select  both  circles  you

can  do  that  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  on  each  and  then  Im  going  to

hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  them

down  like  like  this  and  if  you  notice

you  can  decrease  the  space  between  the

words  or  you  can  increase  the  space

between  the  words  whatever  works  best

for  your  uh  however  you  have  things

arranged  right  now  I  want  to  leave  some

space  in  there  because  were  going  to

put  were  going  to  be  putting  these  uh

these  little  tails  on  the  end  here  so

Im  going  to  leave  a  little  bit  of  space

for  that  and  Im  going  to  leave  that

just  as  it  is  and  now  Im  just  going  to

adjust  my  circles  to  make  up  for  the  uh

Missing  space  there  because  if  you

notice  this  is  uh  the  larger  Circle  here

is  no  longer  aligned  with  the  other  text

there  we  go

and  that  looks  a  little  better  and  Im

going  to  increase  the  spacing  between

these  letters  down  here  because  these

letters  look  a  little  closer  together

than  these  ones  do  just  because  of  the

Contour  of  the  circle  thats  just  how  it

works  so  let  me  grab  my  text  tool  let  me

select  all  of  the  text  Ill  come  over

here  to  my  spacing  and  Ill  put  a  little

more  spacing  in  there  maybe  for  this  one

Ill  try  five  and  that  looks  a  lot

better  so  what  were  going  to  do  now

once  youre  happy  with  your  text  and  the

placing  and  the  spacing  between

everything  Click  on  each  of  these

circles  and  lets  turn  off  the  fill

color  Al  together  so  select  it  and  then

come  over  here  to  this  red  X  and  click

on  that  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  Ill

come  over  here  to  this  circle  and  click

on  the  Red  X  over  here  now  from  this

point  forward  its  important  to  remember

that  this  these  text  items  are  linked  to

the  invisible  circles  that  theyre

placed  on  so  try  not  to  click  or  drag

any  of  these  text  items  out  of  the  way

otherwise  youre  going  to  mess  up  the

balance  of  everything  and  if  at  any

point  you  need  to  go  back  to  those

circles  and  adjust  things  if  you  notice

you  cant  click  on  those  circles  now

because  theyre  invisible  you  can  get  to

them  by  going  to  view  and  going  to

display  mode  and  selecting  outline  and

once  you  can  see  the  outlines  then  you

can  click  on  them  and  select  them  thats

just  in  case  you  need  to  go  back  and

edit  this  at  all  though  so  Im  happy

with  how  it  is  so  Im  going  to  go  back

to  my  regular  display  mode  Ill  go  to

view  Ill  go  to  display  mode  and  select

normal  and  now  Im  going  to  create  these

Rings  going  around  either  side  of  the

text  here  so  let  me  come  back  in  here

Im  going  to  go  back  to  my  circles  and

ellipses

tool  click  and  drag  to  create  a  circle

ircle  Im  going  to  hold  control  so  we

have  a  perfectly  round  circle  and  I  want

to  get  rid  of  the  fill  color  and  I  want

to  add  a  black  stroke  so  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  click  on  the  black  color

over  here  and  then  I  will  grab  my

selection  tool  and  I  will  Center  this  on

the  page  as  well  and  now  I  just  want  to

scale  this  down  so  that  it  encompasses

the  text  there  like  that  and  what  Im

going  to  do  now  is  Im  going  to  come  up

here  to  this  option  where  it  says  when

scaling  objects  scale  the  stroke  width

by  the  same  proportion  make  sure  you

have  that  deselected  if  you  have  it  in

right  now  go  ahead  and  disable  that  and

now  Ill  come  over  here  to  my  well

actually  I  want  to  open  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  so  Ill  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  object  and  go  to  fill  in

stroke  and  I  want  to  click  on  the  stroke

style  Tab  and  I  want  to  change  the  size

or  the  weight  of  this  stroke  so  that

its  kind  of  consistent  with  the  text

there  it  already  looks  like  a  pretty

good  size  as  it  is  but  maybe  a  little

smaller  it  would  look  better  so  Im

going  to  try  eight  and  see  how  that

looks  maybe

nine  okay  nine  looks  good  so  Ill  leave

that  as  it  is  and  now  Im  going  to  right

click  this  and  go  to  duplicate  and  then

Ill  hold  control  and  shift  and  scale

this  down  so  that  we  have  this  ring  on

the  inside  here  and  if  you  notice  as  I

scale  this  down  the  stroke  weight  stays

the  same  size  thats  why  we  disabled

that  option  up  there  so  let  me  make  this

a  little  bigger  what  Im  looking  at  here

is  the  spacing  between  the  bottom  and

the  top  here  we  want  to  make  sure

theres  about  an  equal  amount  of  padding

between  each  of  between  each  of  those

there  we  go  that  looks  pretty  good  let

me  zoom  out  and  now  what  Im  going  to  do

is  Im  going  to  create  this  little  uh

this  little  side  ring  that  you  see  going

along  the  side  here  so  let  me  zoom  out

let  me  come  back  over  here  and  Im  going

to  duplicate  this  again  Im  going  to

right  click  it  and  go  to  duplicate  and

hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  this

down  so  that  its  going  about  halfway

through  these  other  two  rings  right  here

and  thats  looking  good  okay  so  now  I

just  want  to  keep  these  portions  of  the

Ring  I  want  to  clip  off  the  parts  where

theyre  going  through  the  text  so  let  me

grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  let  me  click

and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  going

through  the  area  of  that  ring  that  Id

like  to  keep  let  me  change  the  color  of

this  let  me  bring  down  its  opacity  so  I

can  see  through  it  and  Ill  come  over

here  to  my  selection  tool  and  Im  just

going  to  adjust  this  if  you  notice  the

top  of  the  rectangle  is  going  right  here

where  that  text  begins  and  I  want  the

same  thing  down  here  about  the  same

about  the  same

amount  and  once  you  do  that  you  can  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  ring  so  you  have

both  the  ring  and  the  rectangle  selected

and  go  to  path  and  select

cut  path  and  then  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything  and  now  you  could

take  the  top  half  of  this  ring  press

delete  to  get  rid  of  it  and  the  same

thing  down  here  click  on  that  press

delete  to  get  rid  of  it  and  if  you

notice  my  Strokes  right  here  have

rounded  caps  on  the  end  of  them  if  yours

are  squared  and  you  want  to  make  them

rounded  like  mine  just  come  over  here

into  the  stroke  style  Tab  and  you  can

see  the  cap  setting  by  default  is  set  to

rounded  if  I  make  it  Square  we  get  that

effect  right  there  but  I  like  how  it

looks  better  rounded  so  Im  going  to  put

that  back  to

rounded  and  now  were  going  to  create

these  little  ribbons  on  the  end  here  or

these  little  Tails  whatever  you  want  to

call  them  so  let  me  come  back  in  here

and  try  to  remember  what  this  value  is

the  size  of  your  stroke  the  size  of  the

stroke  should  be  the  same  for  the  entire

design  so  Im  working  with  a  nine  pixel

stroke  for  my  design  so  I  want  to  make

sure  that  everything  that  I  create  from

here  on  out  also  has  a  nine  pixel  stroke

so  let  me  grab  my  rectangle  tool  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  this  area

of  the  circle  where  I  want  that  Banner

to

be  and  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a

path  I  will  go  to  path  and  select  object

to

path  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  Ill

come  back  over  here  to  my  alignment  menu

and  I  want  to  make  sure  that  this  is

aligned  vertically  and  horizontally  as

well  and  Ill  make  this  one  maybe  a

little

smaller  there  we  go  let  me  adjust  the

alignment  Im  going  to  remove  the  fill

color  Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click

on  the  color  black  to  add  that  stroke  on

there  and  again  I  want  this  stroke  to  be

the  same  weight  as  the  other  Strokes  I

can  already  tell  that  this  is  larger  so

let  me  come  back  over  here  to  my  fill

and  stroke  menu  and  Im  going  to  change

this  back  to

nine  and  now  were  going  to  put  little

indents  on  the  ends  here  so  let  me  grab

my  nodes  tool  Ill  click  and  drag  over

these  two  nodes  and  Ill  click  this

button  up  here  that  says  insert  new

nodes  into  selected

segments  and  thats  going  to  put  a  new

node  in  there  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  Ill  select  these  two  and  I

will  add  a  new  node  in  there  and  now  I

just  want  to  click  and  drag  over  those

two  middle  nodes  that  I  just  have  those

two  Center  nodes  selected  and  I  will

enable  this  option  up  here  in  the  tool

settings  menu  that  says  show

transformation  handles  for  selected

nodes  and  when  I  click  on  that  you  can

see  we  now  have  these  transformation

handles  Im  going  to  click  and  drag  on

this  Arrow  Im  going  to  hold  control  and

shift  and  scale  this  in  like  that  so

that  it  scales  from  both  sides  and  we

end  up  with  that  sort  of  effect  right

there  and  now  I  will  disable  this

setting  and  go  back  to  my  selection

tool  and  Im  just  going  to  adjust  the

height  of  this  Im  going  to  make  this  a

little  smaller  height-wise  because  I

notice  not  much  of  this  part  of  the

design  is  sticking  out  there  and  Id

like  to  see  more  of  that  so  Im  going  to

adjust  this  height  accordingly  and  I

will  Center  that  and  now  we  just  got  to

clip  out  these  areas  from  here  if  you

notice  we  removed  all  of  these  unwanted

areas  so  lets  go  back  and  do  all  of

that  uh  what  Im  going  to  do  is  first

Im  going  to  select  Im  going  to  select

these  the  smaller  ring  in  the  center  in

the  center  here  I  will  right  click  that

and  go  to  duplicate  and  then  hold  shift

and  click  on  that  rectangle  and  go  to

path  and

select  cut

path  and  now  we  can  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  and  we  can  just  get  rid  of

these  pieces  on  the  inside  here  and  now

Im  going  to  come  over  here  Im  going  to

select  this  object  right  click  go  to

duplicate  hold  shift  click  on  this  path

right  here  and  go  to  path  and  select  cut

path  and  then  I  can  get  rid  of

that  and  then  one  more  time  I  will  do

the  same  thing  to  the  larger  ring  now  so

Ill  take  this  object  right  click  it  go

to  duplicate

hold  shift  click  on  the  larger  ring  go

to  path  and  select  cut  path  and  now  I

can  get  rid  of  this  as  well  now  if  you

notice  over  here  this  stroke  is  sticking

out  you  could  barely  see  it  but  theres

a  tiny  little  bump  sticking  out  there  uh

you  can  adjust  that  by  grabbing  your

nodes  tool  and  selecting  it  and  then

just  moving  it  over  a  little  bit  Im

going  to  hold  control  while  I  do  that  to

make  sure  it  does  not  leave  the

horizontal  axis  and  then  Ill  just  move

it  in  a  little  bit  there  we  go  that

looks  better  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  Ill  click  on  this  node  and

then  just  hold  control  and  move  that  in

like  that  and  now  Im  going  to  repeat

this  process  over  here  on  this  side  so

let  me  go  back  to  my  selection  tool  make

a  duplicate  of  this  one  instead  of  right

clicking  and  going  to  duplicate  you  can

just  press  contrl  D  on  your  keyboard  or

command  D  if  youre  using  Mac  to

duplicate  it  hold  shift  click  on  this

stroke  go  to  path  and  select  cut  path

get  rid  of  that  piece  right  there  and  I

will  do  the  same  thing  one  more  time  Im

going  to  duplicate  that  hold  shift  click

on  the  circle  and  we  will  cut  the  path

and  get  rid  of  that  and  there  we  go  so

now  Im  going  to  press  one  of  the

keyboard  to  zoom  out  to

100%  And  if  you  notice  the  way  I  created

this  these  ribbons  are  sticking  out  from

the  circle  a  little  too  far  from  my

liking  so  if  you  want  to  adjust  this

just  go  to  your  nodes  tool  and  select

the  object  and  just  select  these  nodes

right  here  let  me  try  that

again  there  we  go  now  you  can  use  your

left  and  right  arrow  keys  to  move  this

in  so  Im  going  to  move  this  in  one  two

three  and  Ill  come  over  here  just  for

the  sake  of  symmetry  you  want  to  do  the

same  thing  over  here  Im  going  to  select

these  ones  and  move  them  in  three  steps

as  well  so  one  two  three  and  Im  just

pressing  my  arrow  keys  to  do

that  so  now  I  will  create  some  text  to

place  in  here  if  you  notice  on  this

design  I  just  placed  the  year  in  there

2023  Ill  just  write  that  Ill  just

write  the  same  thing  in  there  for  the

sake  of  this  tutorial  obviously  you

would  want  to  write  whatever  you  want  in

there  so  Im  going  to  write

20  let  me  change  the  text  style  of  that

let  me  find  my  original  font  that  I  was

working  with

there  we  go  and  let  me  bring  this  in

here  like

that  scale  that  down  a  little  bit  so  it

fits  select  both  we  want  to  select  both

objects  there  go  to  the  alignment  menu

and  now  were  going  to  change  the

relative  to  last  selected  and  then

Center  that  on  the  horizontal  axis  and

then  Ill  duplicate  this  Ill  press

command  D  or  control  D  and  then  just

bring  this  over  here  again  holding  the

control  key  while  I  slide  this  over  so

it  stays  on  that  horizontal  plane  and  I

will  change  this  one  to

23  Ill  just  move  that  over  a  little  bit

more  and  if  you  notice  over  here  thing

this  part  of  the  stroke  is  sticking  out

a  little  bit  as  well  so  let  me  grab  my

nodes  tool  and  just  make  a  quick  little

adjustment

there  there  we  go  and  this  side  looks

good  although  theres  a  tiny  bit

sticking  out  there  let  me  select  just

that  node  and  bring  that  out  there  we  go

that  looks

better  and  now  what  we  want  to  do  is  the

design  itself  is  is  finished  but  if  you

want  to  color  everything  in  and  stylize

it  were  going  to  have  to  make  a  few

adjustments  here  so  the  first  thing  I

want  to  do  is  select  all  of  the  items

that  are  Strokes  so  Im  going  to  hold

shift  and  click  on  each  of  these  Rings

remember  you  got  to  you  got  to  select

the  top  and  the  bottom  half  of  the  Ring

because  those  are  broken  up  now  and  I

want  to  select  these  pieces  down  here

and  this  piece  over  here  as  well  Ill

select  these  pieces  were  basically

selecting  everything  except  for  the  text

items  and  with  them  all  selected  we  want

to  merge  them  all  together  or  com  Bine

them  rather  well  go  to  path  and  we  will

select  uh  were  looking  for  combine

right  here  and  once  theyre  combined  you

can  change  the  stroke  color  so  let  me

come  over  here  to  my  fill  in  stroke  tab

Ill  go  to  the  stroke  paint  Tab  and  we

can  make  this  a  different  color  Im

going  to  make

this  a  dark  shade  of  blue  like  I  did  in

the

thumbnail  and  now  Im  going  to  make  the

text  the  same  color  so  Im  going  to

select  the  text  items  Im  holding  shift

while  I  do  this  and  I  want  to  go  to  my

dropper  which  is  over  here  and  I  will

just  sample  a  selection  of  this  blue

right  there  and  now  thats  the  same

color  let  me  go  to  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  and  click  and  drag  to

create  a  circle  and  I  will  make  this  one

a  different  color  Ill  make  this  Im

going  to  use  the  colors  that  I  used  over

here  for  this  thumbnail  Ill  make  this

part  yellow  this  part  blue  and  this  part

A  light  shade  of  red  so  Ill  come  back

in  here  grab  my  selection  tool  Ill  make

this  one  a  lighter  shade  of  yellow  Ill

send  this  to  the

back  and  come  back  over  here  to  my

aligned  distribute  menu  set  this  back  to

page  and  now  I  want  to  Center  this  on

the  page  and  I  will  just  scale  this  up  a

little  bit  Im  going  to  hold  control  and

shift  while  Im  scaling  that  up  and  we

want  this  to  fill  in  the  circle  but  we

dont  want  it  to  extend  beyond  the

circle  so  we  want  it  placed  within  the

boundary  of  that  stroke  there  and  then  I

will  duplicate  this  Ill  press  control  D

to  duplicate  it  and  Ill  make  this  one  a

lighter  shade  of  blue  let  me  just  adjust

that  color  a  little  bit  so  we  have  a

different

shade  and  Ill  lower  this  one  down  a  few

steps  oh  we  dont  want  it  that  far  let

me  raise  it  one  more  we  want  it  to  be

above  the  yellow  one  and  then  Ill  just

hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  this

down  so  that  its  in  there  now  and  then

finally  all  we  have  to  do  now  is  fill  in

these  areas  so  to  do  this  Im  just  going

to  grab  my  my  pen  tool  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  could  press  B  on  the

keyboard  to  access  it  and  make  sure  you

have  the  correct  setting  here  we  want

this  setting  right  here  and  Im  just

going  to  click  to  create  points  going

through  here

and  draw  a  shape  that  matches  the  shape

of  this  object  here  and  let  me  make  that

a  lighter  shade  of  red  like  that  Im

going  to  remove  The  Stroke  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  the  X  grab  the

selection  tool  and  I  will  lower  this  a

few  steps  until  its  beneath  everything

there  we  go  looking  good  and  now  Im

just  going  to  instead  of  drawing  another

shape  over  here  Im  just  going  to

duplicate  this  and  flip  it  so  Ill  press

controll  D  I  will  flip  it  on  the

horizontal  axis  and  then  just  bring  this

over  here  and  I  will  lower  this  down  as

well  and  now  at  this  point  you  can  you

can  import  your  own  graphic  or  your  own

icon  or  whatever  you  want  to  put  in

there  uh  for  this  this  demonstration  I

just  used  the  inkscape  logo  Im  not

going  to  go  through  that  and  do  that

again  its  already  there  but  you  get  the

idea  you  can  now  put  whatever  you  want

in  there  and  once  youre  finished  uh  and

youre  happy  with  everything  you  can

either  save  this  design  as  it  is  right

now  or  you  can  select  the  text  if  you

select  the  text  and  go  to  path  object  to

path  you  can  now  edit  the  design  so  let

me  go  and  convert  this  to  object  to  path

and  now  I  can  select  everything  and  I

can  move  it  around  and  resize  it  if  I

want  if  you  try  moving  moving  it  around

and  resizing  it  before  converting  that

text  to  a  path  then  youre  going  to  lose

the  text  on  the  path  its  not  going  to

be  wrapped  around  that  Circle  anymore  uh

but  the  downside  is  is  once  you  do  that

now  you  cant  edit  the  text  anymore  so

make  sure  you  dont  do  that  until  youre

completely  happy  with  how  the  text  looks

and  lets  say  for  example  you  want  to

scale  this  up  a  little  bit  Im  going  to

hold  control  Im  going  to  scale  this  up

its  going  to  make  those  Strokes  look  a

little

smaller  because  the  weight  of  them  is

fixed  relative  to  the  size  and  once

youre  happy  with  that  as  well  you  can

turn  this  setting  back  on  that  says  uh

scaling  objects  scale  the  stroke  width

by  the  same  proportion  and  Ill  just

group  everything  together  I  will  go  to

object  and  select  group  and  there  you  go

now  you  can  scale  this  and  edit  it

however  you  want  now  you  have  a  simple

logo  that  you  can  work  with  so  thats

how  you  can  go  about  creating  that  logo

with  inkscape  if  you  have  any  questions
