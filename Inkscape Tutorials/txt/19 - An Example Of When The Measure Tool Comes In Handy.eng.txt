in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  an

example  of  when  the  measurement  tool

would  come  in  handy  in  inkscape  and  the

example  well  be  working  with  in  this

lesson  is  the  Gmail  logo  now  this  is  a

rasterized  PNG  image  that  I  have  copied

and  pasted  into  inkscape  if  I  zoom  in

here  you  can  see  the  pixelation  lets

say  we  wanted  to  trace  a  vector  copy  of

this  logo  to  work  with  the  way  that  you

would  normally  do  that  is  by  creating

individual  shapes  in  this  example  it

would  be  rectangles  that  make  up  the

design  here  now  the  problem  with  the

Gmail  logo  is  that  these  lines  here  go

at  an  unusual  angle  normally  when  youre

working  with  inkscape  you  can  rotate

objects  in  15  degree  increments  or  you

can  rotate  them  freehand  now  the  problem

with  rotating  them  freehand  is  that

youll  have  to  guess  what  size  the

rectangle  has  to  be  before  rotating  it

otherwise  it  wont  be  accurate  so  this

is  where  the  measurement  tool  comes  in

handy

so  Im  going  to  click  on  the  logo  to

select  it  and  Im  going  to bring  down

the  opacity  in  half  just  so  I  can  see

the  measurements  that  Im  taking  on  top

of  it  and  then  Im  going  to  zoom  in  here

and  I  want  to  take  a  measurement  of  this

line  right  here  to  find  out  what  this

angle  is  and  to  do  that  Im  going  to  use

the  measurement  tool  which  is  located

over  here  in  the  toolbar  or  you  can

access  it  by  pressing  the  letter  M  on

the  keyboard

and  with  that  tool  enabled  Im  going  to

bring  my  cursor  over  to  the  edge  of  the

line  here  and  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  a  line

that  goes  along  the  edge  of  the  logo

there  and  as  you  can  see  the  measurement

that  Im  working  with  is  37.14  now  this

isnt  totally  accurate  so  Im  just  going

to  change  this  a  little  bit  just  to  make

sure  its  flush  against  the  edge  there

okay  now  we  have  a  more  accurate

measurement  this  angle  right  here  is

36.95  so  Im  going  to  remember  that

number  and  now  Im  going  to  create

guides  and  change  the  angles  of  those

guides  to  match  that  right  there  so  let

me  go  back  to  my  selection  tool

now  Im  going  to  enable  the  ruler  on  my

canvas  so  that  I  can  create  my  guides  if

youre  using  Windows  or  Linux  you  can

get  your  ruler  by  pressing  Ctrl  r  or  if

youre  using  Mac  you  could  press  command

R  and  there  we  have  the  ruler  on  the

screen

so  with  the  ruler  enabled  Im  going  to

bring  my  cursor  to  the  top  edge  of  the

ruler  and  click  and  drag  down  to  create

a  guide  like  that

and  now  Im  going  to  change  the  angle  of

this  guide  by  hovering  my  cursor  over

until  it  highlights  red  and  then  double

clicking  it  and  then  well  get  this  menu

here  where  we  can  change  the  angle  if

you  see  right  here  we  have  angle  and

this  the  angle  is  set  to  zero  so  Im

going  to  change  this  to  my  measurement

which  is  36.95  and  I  will  press  ok

and  now  I  can  take  this  guide  and  I  can

place  it  up  against  the  edge  of  the

design  there  and  now  I  can  make  a

duplicate  of  this  guide  I  can  double

click  it  again  and  I  can  go  to  duplicate

and  I  can  take  this  duplicate  copy  and  I

can  place  this  on  the  bottom  Edge  right

here

let  me  just  move  in  a  little  closer  here

and  make  sure  that  that  is  a  little  more

accurate

okay  thats  better

now  you  may  be  wondering  if  we  have  to

create  more  guides  for  this  side

normally  we  would  but  with  this  design

this  design  is  symmetrical  so  we  wont

have  to  do  that  we  can  just  create  the

left  hand  side  and  then  make  a  duplicate

copy  and  mirror  it  over  here  to  the

right  hand  side  so  were  good  with  these

guides  as  it  is  lets  trace  the  rest  of

this  logo  Im  going  to  grab  my  bezier

pen  by  pressing  B  on  the  keyboard  and  I

want  to  make  sure  I  have  the  proper

setting  enabled

and  Im  going  to  start  the  line  halfway

through  the  design  right  here  first  let

me  turn  on  snapping  so  I  can  snap  to  the

guide

Im  going  to  snap  right  there

and  then  hold  Ctrl  and  bring  the  line

straight  up  to  the  other  guide  and  click

again

and  then  Im  going  to  bring  this  line

all  the  way  out  here  I  want  this  to  I

want  this  to  really  stick  out  far

because  were  going  to  trim  off  the

edges  Im  going  to  bring  this  out  here

and  then  Ill  snap  to  this  line  again

and  then  Ill  come  back  to  the  starting

point  over  here  like  that

and  now  weve  completed  the  shape

so  now  lets  complete  the  rest  of  the

design  Im  going  to  turn  off  snapping

let  me  fill  in  this  shape  here  Im  going

to  give  this  a  color  Im  going  to  remove

The  Stroke  by  holding  shift  and  clicking

this  red  X  down  here  and  Ill  bring  down

the  opacity  of  this  as  well  so  I  can  see

whats  going  on  beneath  it

and  now  Im  going  to  create  another

shape  for  this  leg  of  the  logo  right

here  Im  going  to come  over  here  to  my

rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  to  create  a  rectangle  that  goes

over  the  top  like  that  I  want  this  to

stick  out  as  well  and  then  Im  going  to

zoom  in  on  this  let  me  make  this  a

different  color  so  I  could  differentiate

it

and  Im  going  to  grab  my  select  tool  and

Im  going  to  come  down  here  and  zoom  in

a  lot  just  so  I  can  make  sure  that  I  get

an  accurate  placement  on  the  edge  of  the

logo  there  and  I  did  that  for  the  bottom

Edge  Ill  come  over  here  and  do  this  for

the  right  Edge  as  well

Im  going  to  change  this  width  right

here

and  then  Ill  do  the  same  over  here  for

the  left  Edge  Im  going  to  make  sure

everything  is  accurate  or  as  close  as  it

can  be  sometimes  its  a  little  different

a  little  difficult  when  you  have

pixelation

and  now  Im  going  to  trim  off  these

unwanted  edges  theres  various  ways  that

we  can  do  this  but  for  this  particular

logo  Im  just  going  to  select  both  of

these  objects  and  go  to  path  and  select

fracture

and  now  I  can  take  this  object  and  get

rid  of  it  and  then  I  can  take  this

object  right  here  and  get  rid  of  that  as

well  and  now  we  can  turn  off  the

visibility  of  the  guides  because  theyre

just  getting  in  the  way  now  by  pressing

the  vertical  Bar  Key  so  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  press  the  vertical  Bar

Key  to  turn  off  the  visibility  and  now

lets  round  these  edges

so  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  if  you  notice

now  we  have  three  different  shapes  that

make  up  the  left  hand  side  of  that  logo

so  let  me  zoom  in  over  here  let  me  go  to

my  edit  pads  my  nodes  tool

and  Im  going  to  enable  the  corners  life

path  effect  and  were  going  to  get  these

round  knots  here  and  Im  going  to  take

this  round  knot  and  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  this  down  until  this  corner

matches  the  Contour  of  the  logo  there

just  like  that  and  that  looks  pretty

good  so  Ill  finalize  that  by  going  to

path  and  selecting  object  to  path  and

then  Ill  come  down  here  and  do  the  same

thing  Im  going  to  click  on  this  object

and  Im  going  to enable  the  live  path

effect  again  the  corners  life  path

effect  and  then  Ill  take  this  knot  and

then  I  will  bring  this  down  until  this

matches  the  Contour  of  this  left  hand

side  right  there

and  then  Ill  finalize  that  by  going  to

path  object  to  path  and  now  we  can  zoom

out  and  at  this  point  the  left  hand  side

of  the  design  is  finished  we  now  just

have  to  duplicate  it  and  mirror  it  to

the  other  side  so  let  me  grab  my

selection  tool  let  me  take  this  take  all

of  these  objects  and  move  them  over  here

let  me  bring  the  opacity  of  them  all  the

way up

and  then  Ill  bring  the  opacity  of  the

original  logo  all  the  way up  as  well

because  were  going  to  color  this  in  in

a  minute

and  Ill  move  this  over  as  a  matter  of

fact  so  I  dont  run  out  of  canvas  space

and  now  Im  going  to  duplicate  this  Im

going  to  right  click  it  and  go  to

duplicate

Im  going  to  bring  this  over  here  I  want

to  flip  this  horizontally  with  this

button  right  here  or  you  can  just  press

the  letter  H  on  the  keyboard

and  Im  going  to  enable  snapping  again

and  Im  just  going  to  snap  these  two

together

and  now  I  want  to  unify  these  two  pieces

together  because  this  is  actually  one

piece  as  you  can  see  in  here  so  Im

going  to  select  this  object  hold  shift

select  this  object  and  go  to  path

Union

and  now  all  we  have  to  do  is  Select  each

object  and  grab  our  dropper  tool  and

change  its  color  so  Im  going  to  select

Im  going  to start  with  this  object

right  here  Im  going  to  grab  the  dropper

tool  which  is  located  over  here  or  Im

just  going  to  use  a  keyboard  shortcut

which  is  the  letter  d  and  then  I  will

just  sample  that  area  right  there  to

make  that  the  same  color  and  then  Ill

go  back  to  my  select  tool  by  pressing

the  letter  s  select  this  object  and  then

back  to  the  dropper  by  pressing  the

letter  d  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  Ill

just  toggle  back  and  forth  between  those

two  tools  and  fill  in  the  rest  of  my

colors  like  this

and  just  like  that  we  have  created  a

vector  copy  of  the  Gmail  logo  so  thats

just  one  example  of  when  the  measurement

tool  can  come  in  handy  in  inkscape

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help
