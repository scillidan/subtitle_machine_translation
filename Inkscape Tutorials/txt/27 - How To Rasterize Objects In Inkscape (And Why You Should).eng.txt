in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  rasterize  Vector  objects  in

inkscape  more  importantly  though  well

be  going  over  why  you  would  want  to  do

such  a  thing  so  lets  get  started  here

on  my  canvas  I  have  this  example  design

which  consists  of  individual  Vector

elements  if  I  zoom  in  on  this  you  can

see  theres  no  quality  loss

if  I  wanted  to  make  a  rasterized  or  a

pixel  based  copy  of  this  design  here  all

I  have  to  do  is  Select  it  and  go  to  edit

and  select  make  a  bitmap  copy

and  when  you  do  that  it  creates  a  copy

of  your  selection  only  its  a  pixel

based  copy  so  if  I  zoom  in  on  this  you

can  see  this  is  indeed  a  pixel  based

image

now  lets  have  a  look  at  an  example  of

when  this  sort  of  thing  would  be  useful

so  on  my  screen  here  I  have  this

halftone  pattern  that  we  created  in  a

previous  tutorial  and  this  actually

serves  as  a  perfect  example  of  when  to

use  this  sort  of  thing  because  this

design  here  consists  of  hundreds  maybe

even  thousands  of  tiny  little  circles

and  because  of  that  the  software  has  to

process  the  information  of  each  and

every  one  of  these  elements  which  can

slow  down  the  software  and  decrease

performance  so  this  is  where  making  a

bitmap  copy  comes  in  handy  because  it

allows  you  to  create  a  pixel  based  copy

which  will  free  up  a  lot  of  CPU  usage

and  make  the  software  run  a  lot  better

so  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

open  my  layers  menu  Im  going  to  come  up

here  to  layers  and  select  layers  and

objects

and  Im  going  to  look  for

here  we  go  Layer  Two  this  is  where  all

of  the  objects  remain  on  this  layer  Im

going  to  select  the  objects  I  want  to

make  a  copy  of

and  if  I  go  to  edit  and  select  make  a

bitmap  copy  we  now  have  an  image  over

here  in  the  layers  menu  so  Im  going  to

take  this  image  and  Im  going  to  pop  it

out  of  the  layer  and  place  it  on  top  of

the  layer  and  if  I  scroll  up  you  can  see

it  up  there  and  then  Im  going  to

collapse  the  layer

and  Im  going  to  lock  the  layer  and  turn

off  the  visibility  of  the  layer  and  now

we  have  just  this  pixel  based  image  here

and  now  the  software  is  already  running

much  smoother  if  I  try  doing  this  and

working  with  this  with  thousands  of

individual  little  elements  being

displayed  on  the  screen  its  going  to

decrease  performance  by  a  lot  now  one

problem  you  may  encounter  when  doing

this  sort  of  thing  if  I  zoom  in  here  you

can  see  the  resolution  isnt  too  great

so  if  you  want  to  make  bitmap  copies

while  preserving  a  higher  resolution

than  what  the  default  is  what  I  would

recommend  doing  is  going  into  inkscape

preferences  if  youre  a  Windows  or  Linux

User  its  up  here  in  the  edit  menu  and

come  down  here  to  where  it  says  either

preferences  or  inkscape  preferences  if

youre  using  Mac  just  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  inkscape  and  select

settings

and  in  the  menu  what  were  looking  for

is  over  here  where  it  says  imported

images  Im  going  to  come  down  here  to

where  it  says  resolution  for  create  a

bitmap  copy  the  default  is  96.  Im  going

to  change  that  to  300.  and  then  close

out  of  the  menu  and  now  next  time  when

you  make  a  bitmap  copy  itll  be  a  much

higher  resolution  so  let  me  show  you

here  as  an  example  let  me  get  rid  of  my

other  copy  and  let  me  make  a  new  copy

of  my  halftones  here  Im  going  to  select

all  of  my  halftones

Ill  go  to  edit  make  a  bitmap  copy

take  the  image  layer  pop  that  out

collapse  the  layer

turn  this  off

and  there  we  go  this  is  a  much  higher

resolution  like  Im  zooming  in  Beyond

100  and  you  dont  see  any  pixelation  yet

in  fact  I  could  zoom  in  quite  a  bit

without  any  kind  of  pixelation

whatsoever  I  have  to  go  pretty  far  there

before  you  start  seeing  the  pixelation

so  thats  a  little  tip  that  you  can  use

to  help  create  higher  resolution  copies

of  your  rasterize  objects  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching



thank  you
