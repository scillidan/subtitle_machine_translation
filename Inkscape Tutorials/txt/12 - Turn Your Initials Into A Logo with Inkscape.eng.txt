in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  take  your  initials  or  any

series  of  letters  and  use  them  to  create

a  logo  where  the  letters  overlap  each

other  and  to  follow  along  with  what  Im

doing  here  in  this  tutorial  Im  going  to

recommend  that  you  download  and  install

this  font  that  I  used  for  this  logo

design  because  this  font  works  really

well  for  this  sort  of  thing  so  check  the

description  of  the  video  for  a  download

link  to  that  font  and  install  it  before

you  launch  inkscape  and  then  youll  be

good  to  go  so  lets  get  rid  of  this  and

well  get  started  here  Im  going  to  grab

my  my  text  tool  and  Im  going  to  click

on  the  canvas  and  Im  going  to  use  the

letters  c  and  b  for  this  demonstration  I

found  that  these  letters  work  really

well  together  but  this  works  with  pretty

much  any  letter  as  long  as  youre  using

this  font  and  Im  going  to  select  the

letters  and  Ill  open  up  my  text  editor

by  going  to  text  and  going  to  text  and

font  and  the  font  Im  looking  for  is

called  winner  so  Im  going  to  type  that

in  and  apply  it  and  now  we  have  the  font

applied  so  let  me  collapse  this  menu  Im

going  to  grab  my  selection  tool  and  Im

going  to  in  increase  the  size  of  this

Im  going  to  hold  my  control  key  while  I

do  that  so  we  can  scale  it  up

proportionately  and  Im  going  to  place

it  in  the  center  of  the  page  so  now

lets  convert  this  from  a  text  object  to

a  path  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path  and  then  we  want  to  split

the  letters  apart  so  Ill  go  back  to  the

path  menu  and  I  will  choose  split  path

and  now  we  have  two  separate  letters  and

Ill  zoom  in  on  this  so  you  can  see  it

better  so  what  were  going  to  do  here  is

Im  going  to  take  this  letter  C  and  Im

going  to  collapse  its  height  and  then

elongate  it  so  that  it  can  intertwine

with  this  letter  B  here  here  and  to  do

that  were  going  to  use  the  nodes  tool

so  let  me  select  the  letter  and  then

Ill  come  over  to  my  nodes  tool  and  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  these  nodes

to  select  them  and  then  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  them  down  Im  going  to

hold  my  control  key  while  I  do  that  and

click  and  drag  to  bring  these  nodes  down

like  this  we  want  this  letter  C  to  fit

within  this  letter  B  uh  and  in  order  to

do  that  we  need  to  shrink  that  down  now

a  problem  Im  running  into  here  is  that

this  part  of  the  design  this  part  of  the

letter  anyway  is  starting  to  collapse  in

on  itself  so  Im  going  to  move  these  up

a  little  bit  Im  going  to  select  just

these  nodes  right  here  and  Im  going  to

use  my  arrow  keys  to  move  them  up  Im

going  to  use  my  up  Arrow  key  and  Im

going  to  count  the  number  of  steps  that

I  used  to  move  these  nodes  because  I

want  to  move  these  nodes  over  here  down

by  the  same  number  of  steps  so  Im  going

to  press  the  up  Arrow  key  1  2  3  four

five  six  seven

eight  15  times  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  down  here  Im  going  to  select

these  nodes  and  Ill  move  them  down  15

Steps  as  well  1  2  3

4  and  we  do  that  just  to  maintain  the

symmetry  tree  so  let  me  grab  my

selection  tool  now  and  Im  going  to  move

this  letter  over  here  and  put  it  on  top

of  the  letter  B  where  I  would  like  it  to

be  and  Ill  go  back  to  my  nodes  tool  and

Im  just  going  to  use  the  nodes  tool  to

select  these  nodes  and  adjust  the  size

of  this  some  more  so  Im  going  to  hold

control  while  I  do  this  so  it  locks  it

onto  the  horizontal  axis  while  I  move

these  nodes  and  Im  going  to  collapse

this  down  a  little  more  what  Im  paying

attention  to  right  here  is  where  the  arm

of  the  C  intersects  with  the  um  negative

space  of  the  letter  B  here  I  want  the

this  to  be  roughly  halfway  through  so

let  me  move  this  up  a  little  bit  and  now

it  looks  like  its  going  about  halfway

through  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  to

these  top  nodes  over  here  Ill  move

these  ones  down  and  again  Im  holding

control  the  whole  time  I  do  this  to  make

sure  that  were  locking  it  onto  the

vertical

axis  and  what  Ill  do  now  is  Ill  grab

my  selection  tool  and  I  will  select  both

of  these  letters  and  Im  going  to  open

up  my  alignment  menu  by  going  over  to

object  and  selecting  aligned  distribute

and  I  want  to  choose  last  selected  and

Im  just  going  to  make  sure  that  they

are  aligned  horizontally  and  vertically

and  then  Ill  collapse  this  menu  and

what  we  can  do  now  is  Im  going  to  make

a  duplicate  copy  of  these  two  letters  so

Im  going  to  rightclick  them  and  go  to

duplicate  and  I  want  to  make  offset

copies  of  these  so  with  them  selected

Im  going  to  go  to  path  and  Im  going  to

select  outset  and  thats  going  to

increase  the  offset  of  the  letters  and

Im  going  to  do  that  a  couple  of  more

times  uh  this  offset  represents  the

spacing  thats  going  to  be  between  the

letters  when  theyre  overlapping  each

other  so  depending  on  how  large  or  small

is  you  may  want  to  repeat  this  step  a

few  more  times  Im  going  to  repeat  this

one  more  time  Im  going  to  choose

outset  and  maybe  Ill  do  it  one  more

time  just  because  I  have  my  letters

pretty  large  Ill  go  to  path  outset  and

now  thats  looking  much  bigger  than  the

original  letters  so  what  we  want  to  do

now  is  lets  click  and  drag  over

everything  we  want  to  select  everything

and  now  we  can  use  the  shape  Builder

tool  to  morph  this  into  what  we  want  it

to  be  so  Im  going  to  come  over  here  to

the  shape  Builder  tool  and  Im  going  to

zoom  in  on  this  and  I  want  to  make  sure

I  have  the  plus  icon  selected  here  the

add  option  and  now  I  can  just  click  and

drag  through  the  areas  of  the  design  and

shape  it  how  I  would  like  it  to  be

shaped  so  Im  going  to  click  and  drag

through  this  part  of  the  design  right

here  because  I  want  this  part  of  the

letter  B  to  overlap  this  part  of  the

letter  c  and  then  I  want  this  part  of

the  letter  c  to  overlap  the  letter  B

over  here  and  then  we  get  that  effect  so

Ill  come  down  here  and  repeat  this  but

the  opposite  way  Im  going  to  make  this

part  overlap  and  then  Ill  make  this

part  overlap  and  then  Im  going  to  click

on  this  part  right  here  to  highlight  it

in  blue  now  its  important  that  you

highlight  everything  that  you  want  to

keep  in  blue  you  have  to  click  on  it  to

highlight  it  in  blue  and  if  you  dont  do

that  its  going  to  be  deleted  once

youre  finished  so  everything  thats

gray  is  going  to  be  deleted  everything

thats  not  blue  is  going  to  be  deleted

and  once  youre  finished  you  can  press

the  check  mark  button  up  here  and  just

like  that  we  have  created  an

interlocking  letter  logo  using  the  shape

Builder  tool  in  inkscape  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

$17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as
