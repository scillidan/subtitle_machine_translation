in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  use  inkscape  to  create  this

Elegant  Style  logo  design  and  if  you

want  to  follow  along  with  what  Im  doing

in  this  lesson  I  will  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  to  where  you

can  download  the  fonts  that  I  used  here

and  Ill  also  include  a  download  link  to

the  file  itself  in  case  you  want  to  skip

the  tutorial  and  just  use  this  design  so

Ill  come  over  here  into  a  new  document

and  we  will  get  started  the  first  thing

Im  going  to  do  is  grab  my  pen  tool

which  is  located  over  here  in  the

toolbar  or  you  can  access  it  by  pressing

the  letter  B  on  your  keyboard  Im  going

to  come  up  here  to  the  settings  and  Im

going  to  make  sure  I  have  the  spiral

path  option  enabled  and  then  Im  going

to  hold  the  control  key  and  click  once

on  the  canvas  to  draw  a  line  and  bring

this  line  straight  up  and  while  still

holding  control  click  again  and  then  we

can  let  go  of  control  and  bring  the  line

out  here  and  then  click  again  and  now  I

can  continue  drawing  this  curve  until  it

spirals  to  the  inside  like  that  once

youre  happy  with  the  placement  you  can

press  the  enter  key  to  place  it  and  if

youre  not  entirely  happy  with  how  it

looks  you  can  come  over  here  to  the  edit

paths  by  nodes  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

and  zoom  in  on  this  and  just  adjust

these  nodes  a  little  bit  now  since  this

is  a  Spyro  path  it  will  be  a  little  hard

to  control  but  thats  to  ensure  that  it

remains  fluid  and  smooth  so  Im  going  to

adjust  this  a  little  bit  until  Im  happy

with  how  it  looks  and  I  think  that  looks

pretty  good  right  there  what  Im  looking

for  mainly  is  I  want  to  make  sure

theres  an  equal  amount  of  space  going

through  here  I  dont  want  too  much  space

on  one  side  I  want  it  to  look  fairly

even  so  now  that  thats  said  Im  going

to  zoom  out

Im  going  to  take  this  node  right  here

click  on  it  to  select  it  let  me  Zoom

down  a  little  bit  Im  going  to  select

this  node  right  here  and  then  Im  going

to  hold  the  control  key  and  just  click

and  drag  that  node  up  like  that  I  want

to  shorten  that  a  little  bit  because  now

Im  going  to  grab  the  selection  tool  and

Im  going  to  right  click  this  and  go  to

duplicate  and  Im  going  to  flip  it

vertically  and  horizontally  and  Im

going  to  bring  this  down  here  on  this

side  now  to  snap  these  together  Im

going  to  come  up  here  and  click  on  this

magnet  icon  to  enable  snapping  and  I

just  want  to  make  sure  I  have  these

simple  controls  in  place  I  want  these

two  options  highlighted  and  now  I  can

zoom  in  on  this  and  snap  this  onto  the

line  Im  bring  that  up  a  little  bit  Im

just  eyeballing  this  here  and  that  looks

pretty  good  as  it  is  now  Im  going  to

create  another  one  for  this  side  so  let

me  right  click  this  and  go  to  duplicate

again  and  Im  going  to  take  this  one  Im

going  to  flip  it  vertically  and  Im

going  to  hold  my  control  key  and  scale

this  one  down  a  little  bit  now  before  I

do  that  let  me  undo  what  I  just  did

right  there  before  you  scale  that  down

make  sure  you  have  this  setting  disabled

this  option  here  that  says  when  scaling

objects  scale  the  stroke  width  by  the

same  proportion  we  want  that  turned  off

for  this  tutorial  so  make  sure  thats

disabled  and  then  scale  this  down  so

that  it  maintains  the  same  stroke  width

and  Im  going  to  Im  going  to  place  this

one  Im  going  to  snap  it  right  over  here

right  about  there  I  may  make  this  one  a

little  bigger  I  dont  like  how  small

that  one  is  Ill  make  that  a  little

bigger  and  Ill  bring  that  down

here  so  now  that  thats  in  place  let  me

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

and  Im  going  to  go  back  to  my  pen  tool

cool  and  Im  going  to  draw  another

little  line  coming  off  of  the  center  of

this  line  here  so  let  me  snap  to  the

line  hold  control  bring  the  line

Straight  Up  Click  again  and  then  bring

this  one  out  here  right  about  there

press  enter  and  there  you  go  thats

about  what  Im  looking  for  and  again  if

youre  not  happy  with  the  placement  you

could  just  grab  the  nodes  tool  and

adjust  it  until  it  looks  good  Im  going

to  take  this  and  bring  this  down  a

little  bit  Im  going  to  hold  control

while  I  do  this  so  that  it  snaps  or  so

that  it  locks  it  onto  the  vertical  axis

and  let  me  right  click  this  and

duplicate  it  and  Im  going  to  flip  this

vertically  and  horizontally  and  bring

this  down  here  so  that  we  have  another

piece  down  here  going  the  opposite  way

and  that  right  there  is  what  were

looking  for  so  what  Ill  do  next  is  Im

going  to  draw  another  line  coming  out  of

the  top  right  here  Im  going  to  grab  my

pen  tool  again  Im  going  to  snap  to  this

intersecting  area  and  then  just  click

and  drag  or  just  click  a  couple  of  times

rather  to  draw  a  line  sort  of  like  that

and  press  enter  its  not  going  to  look

good  at  first  but  thats  okay  CU  were

going  to  go  to  the  edit  pads  by  no  noes

tool  and  adjust  this  until  it  looks

right  so  Im  going  to  move  this  you  got

to  be  careful  of  the  snapping  here  there

we  go  and  maybe  Ill  adjust  that  a

little

bit  okay  that  looks  good  as  it  is  okay

so  let  me  zoom  out  now  what  Im  going  to

do  is  Im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  I  want  to  select  all  of  these

pieces  and  I  want  to  convert  them  from

spiral  paths  to  just  regular  paths  so

Ill  come  up  here  to  path  and  I  will

select  object  to  path

and  now  Im  going  to  group  them  together

by  going  to  object  group  and  now  Im

going  to  click  on  it  to  get  the  rotation

handles  and  I  want  to  rotate  this  around

clockwise  until  its  sitting  flat  like

this  and  what  Im  looking  for  is  the

bottom  of  this  side  and  the  bottom  of

this  side  I  want  to  make  sure  theyre

both  sitting  flat  on  the  bounding  box  of

the  selection  while  I  rotate  it  so  let

me  just  make  sure  um  let  me  just  make

sure  everythings  even  that  looks  pretty

good  as  it  is  and  now  I  can  zoom  out  and

now  were  going  to  ungroup  this  so  lets

come  up  here  to  object  and  go  to

ungroup  and  then  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  and  Ill  do  that  just  by

double  clicking  this  black  stripe  down

here  and  thatll  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  I  want  to  come  over  here  to

the  stroke  style  Tab  and  I  want  to

increase  the  width  so  Im  going  to  click

on  this  plus  icon  and  hold  that  click  to

make  this  to  make  those  lines  thicker

and  I  want  to  give  them  rounded

caps  and  now  Im  going  to  click  off  of

it  to  deselect  everything  Im  going  to

add  little  circles  at  the  ends  of  these

uh  lines  here  show  you  what  I  mean  in

this  design  over  here  I  have  these

little  circles  on  these  ends  so  let  me

show  you  how  you  can  do  that  Im  going

to  select  this  object  right  here  first

and  Ill  come  over  here  to  the  markers

in  the  stroke  style  tab  Im  going  to

come  over  here  to  where  it  says  markers

and  I  want  to  add  an  ends  marker  Im

going  to  click  on  this  drop  down  and  Im

going  to  choose  this  round  option  but

when  you  do  that  its  going  to  be  a

little  too  big  so  Im  going  to  bring

that  down  in  size  a  little  bit  Im  going

to  manually  type  in  the  default  size  is

one  Im  going  to  bring  this  down  to

about  0.5  and  see  how  that

looks  okay  thats  a  a  good  proportion

right  there  so  Ill  leave  that  as  it  is

and  Im  going  to  do  the  same  thing  over

here  Im  going  to  apply  that  to  this

object  as  well  Im  going  to  apply  that

same  marker  now  now  that  you  applied  the

first  marker  you  should  have  it  up  here

in  your  recently  used  markers  and  you

can  just  select  it  and  you  wont  have  to

resize  this  one  itll  inherit  the  size

of  the  previous

one  and  Ill  apply  that  to  this  part  as

well  let  me  come  up  here  and  choose  uh

the  same

marker  and  now  Im  just  going  to  put

just  as  like  a  decorative  element  Im

going  to  put  three  little  circles  in

there  so  let  me  come  back  in  here  and

add  those  three  little  circles  let  me

grab  my  circles  and  ellipses  tool  Im

going  to  turn  off  snapping  right  now

thats  just  going  to  get  in  the  way  and

Ill  hold  control  and  click  and  drag  to

draw  perfectly  around  Circle  go  back  to

my  selection

tool  and  I  will  make  this  a  little

bigger  actually  no  Ill  leave  that  as  it

is  Ill  right  click  it  go  to  duplicate

and  Ill  make  this  one  a  little

bigger  and  then  Ill  create  one  more

right  click  duplicate  and  Ill  make  this

one  even  even

bigger  holding  control  while  I  do  this

to  lock  the  aspect  ratio  there  we  go  now

Im  going  to  zoom

out  okay  that  looks  pretty  good  so  what

Im  going  to  do  now  is  Im  going  to

select  all  of  this  well  first  of  all  let

me  click  on  one  of  these  and  find  out

what  exactly  the  stroke  weight  is  so  for

mine  the  stroke  weight  is  six  so

whatever  your  number  is  keep  that  in

mind  were  going  to  use  that  in  just  a

minute  let  me  select  all  of  this  go  to

object  group  and  now  Im  going  to  create

a  Circle  so  Im  going  to  grab  my  circles

and  ellipses  tool  click  and  drag  while

holding  control  to  create  a  perfectly

round  circle  and  I  want  to  give  this  the

same  properties  that  this  these  objects

have  so  Im  going  to  remove  the  fill  by

clicking  the  Red  X  and  Im  going  to  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  color  black  to

apply  a  stroke  and  it  looks  like  it

inherited  that  stroke  width  already  so  I

dont  have  to  manually  type  that  in  if

this  were  any  other  number  than  six  Id

have  to  type  that  in  and  press  enter  but

it  looks  like  Im  good  to  go  so  let  me

take  this  and  move  this  over  Im  going

to  scale  this  down  accordingly  Ill

bring  it  down  maybe  that  much

and  I  want  to  make  sure  that  this  is

sitting  on  the  same  horizontal  plane

that  this  object  is  so  let  me  select

this  object  hold  shift  select  this

object  and  then  open  up  the  aligned

distribute  menu  by  going  to  object  and

aligned

distribute  and  Im  going  to  choose  last

selected  from  the  relative  two  dropdown

and  I  want  to  choose  this  option  down

here  that  says  align  bottom  edges  and

thats  going  to  put  both  of  those  on  the

same  horizontal  plane  and  Im  going

click  off  of  that  to  deselect  it  and

then  Ill  take  this  one  and  just  move

this  in  a  little  bit  and  Im  holding

control  while  I  click  and  drag  so  that  I

lock  it  onto  that  horizontal  plane  and  I

dont  lose  that  alignment  that  I  just

made  okay  so  let  me  take  this  object  now

right  click  it  go  to  duplicate  Im  going

to  flip  this  one

horizontally  hold  control  and  move  this

one  over  here  just  like

that  and  now  Im  going  to  select  both  of

these  Im  holding  shift  while  I  click  on

each  of  them  to  select  them  both  and  I

want  to  group  them  together  well  go  to

object  group  and  I  want  to  Center  it  on

this  circle  just  to  make  sure  that

everything  is  perfectly  symmetrical  Ill

select  the  uh  Center  on  vertical  axis

there  we  go  and  now  I  can  ungroup

everything  so  Ill  go  to  object  and

select

ungroup  and  now  Im  going  to  put  another

Circle  in  the  center  here  so  let  me  take

this  circle  right  click  it  go  to

duplicate  hold  control  and  shift  and

scale  this  down  about  that  much  and  in

here  you  can  put  whatever  you  want

whether  it  be  a  letter  or  an  icon  or  any

other  graphical  depiction  for  my

demonstration  I  use  the  inkscape  logo  I

figured  it  makes  sense  since  this  is  an

inkscape  tutorial  but  you  could  put

whatever  you  want  in  there  Im  just

going  to  leave  it  blank  for  now  and  now

Im  going  to  put  some  lines  underneath

it  here  if  you  notice  I  had  some  lines

going  underneath  these

elements  so  let  me  come  back  in  here  Im

going  to  grab  my  pen  tool  again  let  me

choose  the  regular  pen  mode  and  then

Ill  come  out  here  click  to  add  a  point

hold  control  bring  the  line  straight

across  right  towards  the  end  of  the

other  side  click  again  and  now  we  can

let  go  of  control  and  and  press  enter  to

have  that  line  made  and  I  want  to  make

that  stroke  the  same  size  let  me  grab  my

selection  tool  Ill  come  back  over  here

to  the  fill  in  stroke  menu  the  stroke

style  tab  Ill  change  this  to

six  I  want  this  to  have  rounded  caps  and

Im  going  to  put  those  markers  on  the

ends  of  these  so  let  me  use  this  drop

down  and  select  those  markers  for  the

first  and  the  last  the  start  and  the  end

point  of  that  path  and  it  now  has  those

markers  so  let  me  make  another  copy  of

this  now  Im  going  to  right  click  it  and

go  to  duplicate  hold  control  and  bring

this  one  down  here  about  that  much  now

the  amount  of  spacing  between  these  two

lines  Im  going  to  use  these  circles  as

a  reference  I  want  the  spacing  between

these  two  lines  to  be  about  equal  to  the

spacing  between  these  two  circles  so  Im

just  going  to  eyeball  that  and  use  my

own  judgment  it  just  gives  the  design  an

overall  more  balanced  and  symmetrical

look  and  once  thats  in  place  Im  going

to  hold  control  and  shift  and  Im  just

going  to  scale  this  down  a  little  bit  I

want  this  line  to  be  a  little  shorter

than  the  other  line  and  that  right  there

is  what  were  going  for  so  now  were

going  to  add  our  text

let  me  grab  the  text  tool  click  and  for

this  demonstration  Im  just  going  to

write

elegant  grab  my  selection  tool  and  Im

going  to  open  up  the  text  editor  which

can  be  accessed  by  uh  going  to  you  can

use  this  icon  down  here  in  the  bottom

right  of  the  screen  this  letter  T  click

on  that  and  now  we  have  our  text  editor

so  let  me  find  the  font  that  Im  using

its  called

Brittanic  there  we  go  Ill  click  apply

and  Im  just  going  to  scale  this  up  to

make  make  it  an  appropriate  size  for  the

logo  maybe  Ill  scale  this  down  a  little

bit  and  again  were  always  holding

control  when  we  scale  so  that  it  locks

the  aspect  ratio  if  you  let  go  of

control  you  get  a  lot  of  distortion

which  you  dont  want  and  now  Im  just

going  to  write  logo  in  a  different  font

next  to  it  so  let  me  go  back  over  here

to  my  text  tool  click  again  and  Im  just

going  to  use  all  caps

logo  and  the  font  for  this  one  is

monserat  monserat  medium  and  again  Ill

have  the  links  to  these  fonts  where  you

can  download  them  and  install  them  in

the  descript  description  of  the  video

These  are  free  fonts  so  you  should  be

able  to  use  them  without  a  problem  let

me  move  this  in

here  scale  it  up  so  its  about  the  same

size  and  I  want  to  decrease  the  the

spacing  between  these  letters  so  let  me

come  back  in  here  to  my  text  tool  Im

going  to  place  the  cursor  between  these

two  letters  and  Im  going  to  hold  my  ALT

key  or  if  youre  on  Mac  it  would  be  the

option  key  and  then  use  the  left  Arrow

just  to  bring  that

in  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  over  here

Ill  move  the  cursor  over  here  holding

my  option  key  or  ALT  key  and  just  use

using  the  arrows  to  bring  those  letters

closer

together  now  Im  going  to  grab  my

selection  tool  select  both  of  these  and

Im  just  going  to  scale  this  up  so  that

it  fits  the  logo  more

nicely  and  at  this  point  the  problem  we

have  now  is  that  the  design  doesnt  look

very  consistent  the  lines  of  the

ornaments  here  are  much  thinner  than  the

lines  of  the  letters  uh  an  easy  little

trick  to  fix  that  you  could  just  select

everything  hold  your  control  key  and

scale  it  down  a  little  bit

and  as  you  scale  It  Down  The  Strokes

will  remain  the  same  weight  but  they

will  just  look  bigger  because  theyre

being  sized  smaller  and  Ill  just  bring

this  down  until  it  looks  pretty

consistent  with  the  weight  of  the

letters  and  thats  really  the  secret

here  to  making  this  design  look  good  you

want  all  of  the  lines  to  be  a  consistent

weight  so  that  it  has  a  uniform

look  okay  that  looks  good  as  it  is  let

me  uh  let  me  update  the  spacing  now  a

little  bit  Im  going  to  move  this  down

Im  going  to  move  this  line  let  me

deselect  that

Im  going  to  move  this  line  down  a

little  bit  and  now  Im  going  to  adjust

the  spacing  in  here  to  accommodate  the

spacing  change  that  I  made  there  let  me

scale  that  down  a  little  bit  Im  holding

control  and  shift  while  I  scale  this

inward  so  that  I  dont  lose  the

orientation  with  the  circle  above

it  and  there  we  go  that  should  do  it  for

this  tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  create

these  decorative  elements  to  make  an

elegant  style  logo  using  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

check  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this
