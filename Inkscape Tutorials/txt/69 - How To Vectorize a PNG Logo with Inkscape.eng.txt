if  the  only  copies  you  have  for  your

logo  are  rasterized  formats  like  PNG  and

jpg  then  you  wont  be  able  to  reap  the

benefits  of  having  a  vector  SVG  file

like  infinite  scaling  and  being  able  to

edit  your  logo  in  the  future  in  that

case  youll  need  to  generate  a  vector

copy  of  your  logo  using  vector  design

software  and  thats  what  Ill  be

demonstrating  in  this  video  this  is  Nick

with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and  in  this

tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating  two

different  ways  in  which  you  can  take  a

logo  in  PNG  format  and  trace  a  vector

SVG  copy  of  it  but  before  we  get  started

if  youd  like  to  learn  more  about  how

Inkscape  works  be  sure  to  check  out  my

Inkscape  masterclass  its  a  collection

of  over  60  videos  where  I  go  over  every

tool  and  feature  in  Inkscape  and  I

explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate  how

it  works  Ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  so  getting  started  as  you

can  see  I  have  Inkscape  opened  up  here

on  my  screen  and  the  first  thing  I  want

to  do  is  just  set  up  the  documents  that

we  are  all  working  with  a  similar  layout

I  want  to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

enable  snapping  and  turn  that  off  and

then  I  want  to  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  view  make  sure  we  have  custom

selected  and  then  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  view  go  to  zoom  view  zoom

and  zoom  in  at  1  to  1  so  what  Im  going

to  do  now  is  Im  going  to  import  my  PNG

logo  into  Inkscape  and  the  way  that  Im

going  to  do  that  is  by  opening  the

folder  where  its  located  and  in

clicking  and  dragging  the  file  onto  the

canvas  now  you  wont  be  able  to  see  me

doing  this  because  I  have  the  folder

opened  up  on  my  other  monitor  but  I  am

clicking  and  dragging  the  file  onto  the

canvas  they  are  in  Inkscape  now  were

gonna  hit  this  little  menu  that  pops  up

Im  going  to  choose  embed  Im  going  to

choose  default  import  resolution  and

then  Im  going  to  choose  none  Ill  click

OK  and  there  you  can  see  that  is  the

Inkscape  logo  that  I  will  be  using  for

this  demonstration  now  let  me  just  zoom

in  on  this  just  to  show  you  that  this  is

indeed  a  raster  format  this  is  not  a

vector  design  so  let  me  zoom  back  out

here  what  I  want  to  do  now  is  I  want  to

change  the  size  of  my  page  border  so

that  it  fits  the  size  of  the  logo  here

so  to  do  that  Im  going  to  select  the

logo  as  you  can  see  here  and  go  to  file

properties  and  I  want  to  expand  this

menu  that  says  resize  page  to  content

and  then  down  here  where  it  says  resize

page  to  drawing  or  selection  go  ahead

and  click  that  and  its  going  to  change

the  page  boundaries  to  where  the  logo  is

so  let  me  go  ahead  and  close  out  of  that

so  like  I  said  at  the  beginning  of  the

video  theres  two  different  ways  where

we  can  go  about  tracing  a  vector  copy  of

this  design  one  is  an  easier  way  where

its  kind  of  like  an  auto  trace  function

using  the  trace  bitmap  feature  and  if

your  design  is  so  complicated  that  that

wont  work  youll  have  to  manually  trace

it  so  Im  gonna  show  you  both  on  you

show  you  the  auto  trace  feature  first  I

want  to  select  the  logo  just  make  sure

you  have  the  logo  selected  here  youll

notice  you  have  it  selected  when  you  see

these  arrows  enabled  and  I  want  to  come

up  here  to  where  it  says  path  and  I  want

to  go  to  trace  bitmap  and  under  this

menu  we  have  these  two  different  options

single  scan  and  multiple  scans  for  this

design  its  just  black  and  white  so  Im

going  to  leave  it  as  single  scan  if  your

design  has  colors  you  might  want  to

click  on  multiple  scans  and  then  you  can

choose  the  number  of  colors  in  the  scan

right  there  but  this  design  is  just

black  and  white  so  Im  gonna  leave  it  a

single  scan  Im  going  to  leave  these

defaults  just  as  they  are  and  Im  going

to  click  update  and  its  gonna  show  you

a  preview  of  whats  going  to  be  traced

in  the  preview  window  here  now  for  these

default  settings  this  worked  pretty  well

thats  exactly  what  Im  looking  to  do

right  there  if  yours  didnt  come  out  as

well  you  may  have  to  adjust  these

settings  a  little  bit  and  play  with  them

a  little  bit  may  even  want  to  change  the

the  type  of  a  trace  that  you  do  here  but

this  worked  well  for  me  so  I  was  going

to  click  OK  and  its  going  to  generate  a

vector  copy  right  on  top  of  that  so  let

me  close  out  of  that  menu  Im  gonna  take

this  if  I  move  this  out  of  the  way  you

can  see  now  this  is  the  vector  copy  this

is  the  original  this  is  the  vector  and

Ill  zoom  in  on  that  just  to  show  you

that  is  indeed  a  vector  copy  you  can

grab  the  nodes  tool  and  you  can  edit

those  nodes  individually  like  you  would

with  any  other  vector  object  so  what  you

can  do  is  now  you  can  color  that  in  you

can  do  whatever  you  want  with  that  one

thing  you  may  notice  is  that  the  filled

in  area  right  here  the  filled  in  area

where  is  white  is  now  negative  space  its

transparency  in  there  if  youre  okay

with  that  then  youre  good  to  go  if

youd  like  to  fill  that  in  with  the

color  or  fill  it  in

white  as  I  did  here  you  can  use  the

bucket  fill  tool  for  that  so  let  me  make

this  black  the  way  it  was  before

let  me  grab  the  bucket  fill  tool  and  Im

gonna  click  on  that  that  empty  space

right  there  to  fill  it  in  now  it  filled

it  in  with  the  color  black  Im  just

gonna  change  this  to  red  to  annouce  so  I

can  see  the  difference  here  and  if  you

notice  its  sticking  out  of  the  edges  a

little  bit  so  Im  going  to  change  that

by  going  to  path  dynamic  offset  and  Im

going  to  take  this  little  note  up  here

and  just  pull  that  out  so  that  it

believes  out  into  the  design  like  that

now  let  me  finalize  that  by  going  to

path  object  to  path  let  me  go  back  to

the  Select  tool  and  I  want  to  lower  this

to  the  bottom  Im  gonna  click  this

button  that  says  lower  selection  to  the

bottom  and  now  its  lowered  beneath  the

design  there  and  I  can  make  that  white

and  as  you  can  see  that  is  no  longer

transparent  that  is  now  filled  with

white  and  down  here  you  could  do  the

same  thing  because  this  is  negative

space  as  well  so  thats  the  auto  trace

thats  the  automated  way  of  tracing  a

vector  copy  of  your  logo  if  that  doesnt

work  because  that  feature  wont  always

work  for  more  elaborate  designs  if  your

design  is  it  maybe  its  like  not  a  high

enough  resolution  that  that  feature  can

work  youll  have  to  manually  trace  a

copy  of  that  using  the  Bezier  a  pen  so

let  me  show  you  how  to  do  that  now  the

first  thing  I  want  to  do  over  here  is

open  up  the  filling  stroke  menu  with

this  button  over  here  the  keyboard

shortcut  would  be  ctrl  shift  F  on  to

take  the  original  logo  right  here  and  I

want  to  bring  me  opacity  down  in  half  so

I  can  see  what  Im  doing  as  a  trace  over

it  and  I  want  to  grab  the  Bezier  pen

which  is  over  here  or  you  could  press  B

on  the  keyboard  and  depending  on  the

type  of  design  you  have  this  design  has

a  lot  of  curves  and  bends  and  contours

and  stuff  for  this  sort  of  design  I  want

to  use  the  b-spline  setting  of  the  tool

Im  gonna  click  b-splines

what  this  does  is  it  basically  forces

you  to  draw  curved  lines  its  kind  of

like  training  wheels  for  the  pen  tool  if

youve  never  used  the  pen  tool  before

this  is  a  great  option  to  use  because  it

forces  you  to  draw  curved  lines  that

will  be  able  thatll  make  it  easier  for

you  to  trace  this  design  right  here  so

let  me  get  rid  of  that  Im  gonna  go

ahead  and  start  tracing  around  this

design  right  here  and  to  move  the  page

around  basic  functions  Im  just  pressing

down  the  mouse  wheel  Im  moving  the

mouse  and  to  zoom  in  and  out  Im  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  and  down  the  mouse

wheel  so  Im  just  going  to  go  around  and

points  going  around  the  design  over  here

to  trace  to  trace  a  shape  going  around

the  logo  and  if  at  any  point  you  need  to

create  a  sharp  corner  because  this  tool

setting  will  not  allow  you  to  create

corners  by  default  what  you  can  do  is

just  hold  shift  and  then  click  and  then

itll  allow  you  to  create  a  corner  as

you  can  see  there  but  Ill  be

demonstrating  that  in  a  minute  when  I  go

over  this  area  right  here  so  let  me  undo

that  Im  gonna  go  and  trace  over  this

logo  really  quickly  Im  just  gonna  do  a

very  quick  and  rudimentary  tracing  of

this  because  Im  not  actually  trying  to

make  a  copy  of  this  logo  Im  just  doing

this  for  a  demonstration

okay  so  once  youre  finished  tracing

around  your  object  here  you  can  just

click  on  the  original  node  right  there

to  close  the  path  and  if  you  zoom  out

you  can  see  let  me  grab  the  Select  tool

move  this  you  can  see  weve  traced  a

shape  over  that  shape  right  there  so  let

me  put  that  back  what  I  want  to  do  now

is  trace  this  other  shape  right  here  so

let  me  go  back  to  the  Bessie  a  penny  let

me  zoom  in  Im  going  to  start  tracing

around  to  this  and  this  is  where  Id

like  to  demonstrate  the  the  corner

feature  so  Im  gonna  bring  this  over

here  like  this  and  again  right  here  we

have  a  sharp  corner  so  Im  gonna  hold

shift  and  click  and  there  you  go  now  you

have  a  sharp  corner  same  thing  up  here

we  have  another  corner  area  hold  shift

click  in  fact  for  the  rest  of  these

points  Im  gonna  be  holding  shift  the

whole  time  to  create  sharp  corners  like

that  until  we  get  right  there  and  now  I

collect  all  of  shift  and  get  back  to

tracing  around  this  design  like  this  now

like  I  said  before  this  b-spline  setting

in  this  tool  its  pretty  much  like

training  wheels  for  the  pen  tool  theres

easier  theres  easier  ways  to  do  this  if

youre  more  advanced  with  using  this

software  but  this  tutorial  is  not  for

advanced  users  this  tutorial  is  for

newcomers  to  Inkscape  who  just  need  to

create  a  vector  tracing  of  a  logo  that

they  have  in  PNG  format  so  let  me  go

ahead  and  finish  tracing  this  back  to

the  starting  point  like  that  looking

pretty  good  now  Im  gonna  go  ahead  and

trace  this  part  down  here  as  well

okay  so  as  you  can  see  I  have  finished

up  Ive  went  and  created  these  shapes  as

well  and  the  shape  and  that  shape  as

well  so  I  dont  know  what  to  do  now  is

we  have  the  shape  we  have  the  designs

wrong  we  just  have  to  color  it  in  now  so

let  me  grab  the  Select  tool  let  me  click

on  the  original  logo  at  the  back  there

at  the  bottom  and  bring  the  opacity  of

that  all  the  way  back  up  now  Im  just

gonna  move  this  out  of  the  way  for  now

if  you  want  to  color  your  design  in  with

the  same  color  as  your  original  design

head  what  you  can  do  is  you  could  just

click  on  the  shape  grab  the  dropper  tool

which  is  over  here  and  then  grab  a

selection  of  that  color  now  this  is  just

black  and  white  so  I  mean  I  could  just

click  the  black  and  white  colors  down

here  but  Im  doing  this  assuming  that

your  logo  that  youre  trying  to  check

trace  is  in  color  so  Im  going  to  show

you  how  to  do  this  as  if  this  were  in

color  let  me  go  back  to  the  select  tool

click  on  this  shape  I  want  to  make  that

white  as  well

if  you  notice  you  cant  see  the  white

there  because  its  a  white  background

its  its  blending  in  against  it  but  it

is  indeed  filled  with  white  let  me  go

back  to  the  dropper  fill  that  in  with

white  and  I  want  to  get  rid  of  that

those  black  outlines  as  well  to  get  rid

of  the  black  outline  just  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  red  X  down  here  now  let  me

go  back  to  the  Select  tool  let  me  take

this  shape  I  wanna  get  rid  of  that  black

outline  as  well  Im  gonna  hold  shift

click  on  the  X  and  then  finally  Im

gonna  make  the  larger  shape  over  here

Im  gonna  make  that  black  hold  shift

click  on  the  X  click  this  shape  do  the

same  thing  just  fill  it  in  with  its

intended  colors  you  can  use  the  dropper

tool  like  I  did  previously  or  you  can

just  fill  it  in  manually  with  these

colors  down  here  like  Im  doing  theres

also  other  ways  you  can  fill  you  can

choose  based  on  RGB  HSL  if  you  have  like

an  HTML  like  a  hex  code  for  your  for

your  design  youd  like  to  fill  it  with

you  can  put  it  right  there

followed  by  FF  so  what  Im  going  to  do

now  is  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a

path  Im  going  to  select  over  everything

click  and  drag  over  everything  and  go  to

path  object  to  path  and  thats  gonna

change  that  from  be  spline  shapes  to

actual  true  vector  paths  now  we  can  take

the  original  logo  and  get  rid  of  that

and  as  you  can  see  weve  finished  we

have  traced  our  vector  logo  so  all  we

have  to  do  now  is  save  a  vector  file

effective  copy  of  it  so  to  do  that  Ill

go  to  file  save  as  and  Im  going  to  save

it  as  a  dot  SVG  file  or  in  Inkscape  SVG

file  or  if  youd  like  to  export  it  as  a

PNG  like  lets  say  you

want  to  enlarge  it  lets  say  the  whole

point  of  vectorizing  your  logo  is  that

you  could  enlarge  it  like  that  and  then

export  a  copy  of  it  what  you  can  do  is

go  to  file  export  PNG  image  and  then

from  here  you  can  choose  export  as  you

can  click  on  that  choose  your  name  and

location  right  there  and  then  click

export  to  export  it  and  I  think  that

should  do  it  for  this  tutorial  so  that

is  how  you  can  go  about  creating  a

vector  copy  of  your  rasterized  PNG  logos

with  Inkscape  if  you  have  any  questions

thanks  for  watching
