in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  noise  gradients  using

inkscape  and  the  example  Ill  be

applying  it  to  is  this  eyeball  that

willll  be  recreating  so  let  me  open  up

inkscape  and  we  will  get  started  so  the

first  thing  Im  going  to  do  is  draw  a

circle  so  Im  going  to  grab  the  circles

and  ellipses  tool  and  Im  going  to  hold

control  and  shift  on  the  keyboard  and

click  and  drag  to  create  a  circle  that

starts  from  the

inside  and  then  Im  going  to  make  this

circle  white  and  then  Ill  grab  my

selection  tool  and  I  will  right  click

this  and  go  to  duplicate  and  Ill  make

this  duplicate  copy  black  and  I  want  to

apply  a  radial  gradient  to  this  black

copy  so  Im  going  to  open  up  the  fill

and  stroke  menu  if  you  dont  have  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  opened  on  your

screen  you  could  just  click  on  this

color  stripe  down  here  where  it  says

fill  and  itll  open  up  that  menu  and

Under  The  Fill  tab  Im  going  to  click  on

this  button  right  here  that  says  radial

gradient  when  you  hover  your  cursor  over

it  and  now  I  want  to  reverse  this

gradient  so  that  black  is  on  the  outside

and  transparency  is  on  the  inside  so  let

me  grab  the  gradient  tool  over  here  and

Im  going  to  click  this  icon  up  here  in

the  tool  settings  menu  that  says  reverse

the  direction  of  the

gradient  and  then  Ill  zoom  in  on  this

Im  going  to  double  click  the  path  the

gradient  path  right  here  to  add  a  new

stop  and  Im  going  to  bring  this  out  a

little  bit  and  then  Ill  hold  control

and  shift  and  grab  this  gradient  handle

and  just  bring  this  in  a  little  bit  like

that  and  now  Ill  zoom  out  so  this  is

the  gradient  let  me  adjust  this  just  a

little  more  this  is  the  gradient  that  I

will  be  applying  the  noise  gradient  to

so  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  let  me

move  this  over  a  little  bit  Im  going  to

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  filters

Ill  go  to  overlays  and  I  will  choose

Im  looking  for  noise  fill  from  this

list  and  Im  going  to  take  this

menu  Im  going  to  tick  the  box  down  here

that  says  live  preview  and  when  I  do

that  you  can  see  there  is  a  noise  uh

filter  applied  to  the  gradient  there  now

a  couple  of  things  to  keep  in  mind  first

things  first  I  want  to  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  noise  color  and  I  want  to

take  this  a  channel  and  make  sure  I  have

this  all  the  way  down  to  zero  if  you

dont  see  an  a  channel  here  just  come  up

here  to  this  drop  down  and  choose  hsl

from  this  list  and  now  Im  going  to  come

back  over  here  to  the  options  Tab  and

the  setting  that  were  going  to  pay

attention  to  the  most  over  here  is

dilation  were  going  to  have  to  adjust

this  dilation  slider  based  on  the  color

that  youre  working  with  and  how  intense

you  want  the  uh  noise  effect  to  look  so

if  I  bring  this  up  you  can  see  it  takes

away  a  lot  of  the  effect  but  if  I  bring

it  down  you  could  see  more  of  the  effect

and  Ill  have  to  adjust  this  according

to  my  own  preferences  so  for  this  design

Im  going  to  bring  this  pretty  low  right

about  there  I  think  maybe  a  little

more  and  that  looks  pretty  good  and  once

you  have  that  applied  you  can  click  the

apply  button  and  now  the  noise  gradient

is  applied  now  if  you  want  to  intensify

this  effect  you  can  apply  it  a  second

time  so  let  me  click  on  live  preview

again  and  you  can  see  we  can  have  we

have  a  second  effect  that  were  applying

there  I  like  how  mine  looks  the  first

time  so  Im  just  going  to  deselect  this

Im  going  to  close  out  of  this  menu  and

one  thing  to  keep  in  mind  if  your

gradient  looks  a  little  blurry  if  the

quality  looks  kind  of  low  uh  it  may  have

something  to  do  with  the  settings  so

come  up  here  to  inkscape  preferences  Im

going  to  go  to  inkscape  and  Im  going  to

click  on  settings  if  youre  using

Windows  just  press  control  shift  p  on

the  keyboard  and  in  this  search  bar  Im

going  to  type

filter  and  Im  going  to  come  down  here

to  where  it  says  filter  effects  quality

I  have  I  have  best  quality  set  for  my

settings  here  and  that  gives  you  the

sharpest  clearest  appearance  for  this

filter  effect  that  were  applying  so  if

yours  looks  a  little  blurry  and  soft

its  probably  because  you  have  average

or  maybe  a  lower  setting  uh  so  set  it  to

best  quality  and  close  out  of  the

menu  and  now  we  can  grab  the  gradient

tool  and  we  can  adjust  this  like  any

other  gradient  you  can  see  we  have  this

noise  effect  here  thats  applied  to  the

gradient  so  Ill  just  adjust  this  a

little  further  and  now  Im  going  to

create  the  rest  of  the  eyeball  so  let  me

grab  my  ellipse  tool  let  me  deselect

everything  by  pressing  the  Escape  key

and  Im  going  to  snap  to  the  center

Center  here  and  Im  going  to  hold

control  and  shift  and  draw  another

Circle  and  I  will  make  this  one  a

lighter  shade  of  blue  and  then  Ill  grab

my  selection  tool  right  click  go  to

duplicate  and  Ill  make  this  second  one

a  darker  shade  of  blue  and  just  like  I

did  previously  this  will  be  the  one  that

I  apply  the  noise  gradient  too  so  let  me

apply  a  radial  gradient  Ill  go  back  to

my  gradient  tool  Ill  reverse  the

direction  of  the

gradient  and  Im  going  to  zoom  in  on

this  a  little  bit  Im  going  to  double

click  the  path  and  just  adjust  this  a

little  bit  there  we

go  and  now  Im  going  to  apply  that

effect  again  so  let  me  grab  my  selection

tool  I  will  go  to

filters  overlays  and  choose  noise  fill

and  Im  going  to  move  my  menu  over  click

the  live  preview  button  and  you  can  see

we  have  the  noise  effect  there  and  Im

going  to  adjust  my  dilation  again  just

so  I  have  the  effect  that  I  want  now  if

you  notice  here  previously  we  used  a

lower  setting  to  get  that  effect  for

this  color  Im  going  to  use  a  higher

setting  Ill  click  apply  close  out  of  it

and  now  I  can  go  back  to  my  gradient

tool  and  adjust  this  as  needed  so  Ill

make  this  oops  let  me  undo  that  Im

going  to  adjust  this  a  little

more  thats  a  little  closer  to  the

effect  that  Im  going

for  and  then  Ill  press  the  Escape  key

to  deselect  everything  and  Ill  grab  my

circle  tool  again  and  create  the  black

circle  for  the  center  of  the  eye  Ill

hold  control  and  shift  and  create

another  Circle  and  it  looks  like  this

ones  already  black  this  is  actually  a

dark  gray  Im  going  to  make  this  black

there  we  go  and  you  can  grab  your

selection  tool  and  you  can  choose  just

how  much  you  want  the  eyeball  to  be

dilated

there  and  then  finally  Im  going  to

apply  a  drop  shadow  behind  everything

here  so  let  me  grab  my  circles  and

ellipses  tool  again  snap  to  the  center

click  and  drag  to  draw  another

Circle  Ill  make  this  one  black  grab  the

selection  tool  and  Im  going  to  lower

this  one  to  the  Bottom  by  clicking  this

button  up  here  in  the  tool  settings  menu

that  says  lower  to  the

bottom  and  for  this  one  Im  going  to

apply  a  and  blur  so  Ill  come  down  here

to  the  blur  slider  and  Ill  bring  that

up  like  that  and  now  I  will  apply

another  noise  overlay  to  this  so  let  me

go  to  filters  overlay  and  I  will  choose

noise  fill  click  live

preview  and  again  we  can  adjust  this  as

needed  and  I  like  how  that  looks  so  I  I

will  finalize  it  by  clicking  apply  close

out  of  the  menu  and  there  you  go  weve

created  that  eyeball  design  that  uses

noise  grading  and  like  I  mentioned

previously  these  gradients  are  editable

like  any  other  gradient  say  for  example

I  wanted  to  change  this  from  a  radial

gradient  to  a  linear  gradient  I  could

just  click  on  the  linear  button  and  now

if  I  grab  my  gradient  tool  you  can  see  I

have  the  editable  linear  gradient  like

that  but  I  liked  how  it  looked

previously  so  Ill  put  that

back  and  there  we  go  that  should  do  it

for  this  tutorial  that  is  how  you  can

apply  noise  gradients  to  objects  using

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

then  consider  checking  out  my  in  inape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

and  best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  $17  one

time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill  have

some  information  about  that  down  below

if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as  always
