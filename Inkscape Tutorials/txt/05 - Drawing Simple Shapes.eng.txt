in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  these  six  icon

designs  using  nothing  but  basic  shapes

in  inkscape  before  we  get  started  though

if  you  want  to  learn  more  about  how

inkscape  Works  be  sure  to  check  out  my

inkscape  master  class  its  a  collection

of  over  80  videos  where  we  go  over  all

of  the  tools  and  features  in  inkscape

and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  we  even  have  a

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you

want  so  the  first  thing  Im  going  to

demonstrate  is  how  to  draw  a  heart  so

let  me  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  Ill  click  and  drag  on  the  canvas

to  draw  a  vertically  elongated  rectangle

and  then  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  and

I  want  to  make  sure  I  have  this  lock

icon  turned  off  up  here  in  the  toolbar

and  for  the  width  I  want  the  width  to  be

100  pixels  and  I  want  the  height  to  be

225

pixels  and  then  Im  going  to  zoom  in  on

this  object  Im  going  to  go  back  to  my

rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to  grab

this  circular  knot  right  here  and  bring

this  all  the  way  down  so  that  we  have

rounded  edges  like  that

then  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  Ill

right  click  the  object  and  go  to

duplicate  I  will  rotate  it

90Â°  select  both  objects  click  on  them  to

get  the  rotation  handles  and  then  hold

your  control  key  and  grab  the  rotation

handle  in  the  corner  here  and  rotate  it

around  until  its  upright  like  that

where  it  sort  of  looks  like  an  X  and  now

you  can  go  into  your  shape  Builder  tool

make  sure  you  have  the  addition  option

enabled  and  click  and  drag  to  draw  a

line  going  through  the  area  of  the

shapes  to  draw  a  heart  now  you  can  go

back  to  your  selection  tool  and  just

like  that  youve  drawn  a

heart  now  lets  go  over  how  you  can  draw

this  waving  flag  icon  Im  going  to  grab

my  rectangle  tool  Ill  click  and  drag  on

the  canvas  to  draw  a

rectangle  and  I  want  to  make  sure  that  I

have  the  edges  rounded  as  I  did  for  the

previous  object  that  we

created  and  then  Im  going  to  draw

another  rectangle  right  about  here  and

bring  it  out  about  that  far

and  I  want  to  get  rid  of  the  rounded

edges  here  so  Ill  come  up  here  and

click  on  this  button  in  the

toolbar  Ill  grab  my  selection  tool  move

this  over  about  here  and  use  this

scaling  handle  right  here  to  size  the

rectangle  appropriately  about  where  it

needs  to  be  relative  to  the  pole  Ill

place  this  right  about  here  we  want  a

little  bit  of  space  to  be  between  the

pole  and  the

flag  once  thats  done  lets  create  an

object  to  place  on  top  of  the  flag  for

my  example  here  I  just  used  a  star  so  I

will  use  that  for  this  demonstration  as

well  but  you  can  use  whatever  youd  like

Im  going  to  grab  my  stars  and  polygons

tool  Im  going  to  choose  the  star  option

I  want  five  corners  and  I  want  the  spoke

ratio  to  be

0.375  and  the  rounded  and  randomized

both  set  to  zero  and  then  I  can  click

and  drag  on  my  canvas  to  draw  a  star

Ill  hold  control  and

shift  and  bring  my  cursor  straight  up

like

that  and  then  Ill  grab  my  selection

tool  Ill  place  this  in  the  center  of

the

rectangle  to  scale  it  down  Im  holding

control  and  shift  and  clicking  and

dragging  the

handle  and  to  place  this  in  the  center

of  the  rectangle  Ill  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  rectangle  so  that  I  have

both  object  selected  and  I  will  open  up

my  aligned  distribute  menu  by  going  to

object  and  selecting  aligned

distribute  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have

last  selected  chosen  from  this  dropdown

and  I  will  Center  it  vertically  and

horizontally

and  then  I  will  go  to  path  and  select

difference  and  its  going  to  subtract

the  star  from  the  rectangle  so  that  it

creates  a  negative  space  area  within  it

now  let  me  just  place  this  over  here  to

readjust  it  I  want  to  make  these  two

corners  of  the  rectangle  rounded  so  let

me  come  over  here  to  my  nodes  tool  Ill

click  on  this  icon  up  here  that  says  add

Corners  live  path  effect  and  Ill  click

on  this  node  to  select  it  and  then  hold

shift  and  click  on  this  node  to  select

it  with  those  two  nodes  selected  you  can

grab  these  white  knots  right  here  and

click  and  drag  them  to  round  the  corners

of  the  selected  nodes  now  Im  going  to

bring  that  down  a  little  more  so  its

not  too

rounded  right  about  there  looks  good  and

once  youre  done  with  that  you  can  click

on  this  Square  icon  up  here  to  convert

them  to  a  path  and  that  finalizes  the

effect  now  Im  going  to  give  the  flag  a

waving  effect  so  to  do  that  let  me  grab

my  selection  tool  Im  going  to  open  up

the  path  effects  menu  by  going  to  path

and  selecting  path  effects  and  from  this

drop  down  over  here  Im  looking  for

envelope  deformation  Im  going  to  select

that  and  I  want  to  uncheck  this  box

right  here  that  says  enable  left  and

right  paths  and  Im  going  to  select  top

Bend  path  right  here  and  Im  going  to

grab  this  top  Edge  and  click  and  drag  it

up  like  that  and  then  Ill  click  on  this

note  over  here  and  Ill  take  this  handle

and  bring  this  down  like  that  so  we  want

a  little  bit  of  a  contour  going  on  the

top  edge  of  the  flag  dont  worry  about

whats  happening  on  the  left  and  right

and  down  here  thats  going  to  come

together  once  we  finish  making  all  of

these  adjustments  so  Im  just  going  to

adjust  this

accordingly  and  then  I  want  to  do  the

same  thing  with  the  bottom  Edge  so  Ill

come  over  here  and  select  bottom  path

and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  Ill  take

this  line  and  Ill  bring  this  one  up  and

Ill  bring  this  one  down  so  that  the

Contours  are  consistent  on  the  top  and

the

bottom  and  that  looks  good  right  there

and  once  youre  finish  you  can  finalize

this  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path  and  just  like  that  youve

created  a  waving  FL  FL

icon  now  well  go  over  how  to  create

this  wi  glass  shape  so  Im  going  to  grab

my  circles  and  ellipses  tool  and  Ill

click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  to  draw  an

elongated  ellipse  like  that  and  Ill

make  this  black  and  Im  going  to  open  up

my  fill-in  stroke  menu  by  double

clicking  the  color  stripe  down  here  next

to  the  fill  label  and  Ill  bring  the

opacity  of  this  down  roughly  in

half  now  I  want  to  make  a  duplicate  copy

of  this  so  let  me  go  to  my  selection

tool  Ill  right  click  this  and  go  to

duplicate  and  Ill  hold  my  shift  key  and

Ill  grab  this  top  Arrow  up  here  and

click  and  drag  to  scale  this  in  and  as

long  as  youre  holding  shift  itll  scale

inward  from  the  top  and  bottom  like  that

and  we  want  to  make  this  about  that

height  right  about

there  and  now  Im  going  to  right  click

this  and  go  to  duplicate  Ill  hold

control  and  bring  this  all  the  way  down

here  and  Ill  make  this  a  little  smaller

by  holding  control  and  taking  this  top

arrow  and  scaling  that  down  a  little

bit  and  then  Im  going  to  convert  this

to  a  path  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path  Ill  grab  the  nodes  tool

and  Ill  take  this  node  right  here  and

click  on  it  to  select  it  and  then  hold

control  and  click  and  drag  it  up  about

that  far  and  the  same  thing  with  this

node  Ill  select  this  Noe  and  Ill  click

and  drag  this  up  just  a  tiny  bit  though

not  much  maybe  about  that  far  and  this

is  going  to  be  the  base  of  the  wine

glass  so  now  Im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  going

between  the  two  objects  here  to

represent  the  stem  of  the  wine  glass  and

I  will  make  these  Corners  sharp  by

clicking  on  this

button  and  Ill  scale  this  down  a  little

bit  Im  going  to  hold  my  shift  key  and

use  this  handle  right  here  to  scale  that

down  and  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have

everything  here  centered  so  let  me  zoom

out  let  me  select  everything  let  come

over  here  to  my  align  and  distribute

menu  and  make  sure  I  have  everything

centered  on  the  vertical

axis  and  now  I  can  come  over  here  into

the  shape  Builder  tool  and  I  can  draw  a

line  through  these  areas  to  draw  the

shape  shape  that  Im  trying  to  create

and  if  I  go  back  to  the  selection  tool

now  all  we  have  to  do  is  round  these

Corners  in  here  so  let  me  grab  the  nodes

tool  and  click  on  the  object  Im  going

to  select  these  four  nodes  right

here  Ill  click  on  this  button  up  here

to  add

Corners  let  me  select  them

again  and  Ill  take  this  handle  and

bring  this  in  or  this  white  this  little

round  white  knot  and  bring  that  in  a

little  bit  just  to  give  a  little  bit  of

a  rounded  rounded  transition  between  the

stem  and  the  other  parts  of  the  glass

and  now  we  can  go  back  to  the  select

tool  and  zoom

out  and  now  we  can  go  to  our  fill  and

stroke  menu  bring  the  opacity  back  up  to

100%  and  there  is  our  wine

glass  next  well  go  over  how  to  create

this  shopping  cart  icon  so  Ill  come

back  into  inkscape  Im  going  to  grab  my

beier  pen  which  is  located  over  here  in

the  toolbar  or  you  can  access  it  by

pressing  the  letter  B  on  your  keyboard

and  up  here  in  the  tool  settings  menu  I

want  to  choose  this  option  right  here

that  says  create  a  sequence  of  straight

line  segments  and  I  want  to  click  once

on  the  canvas  to  create  a  point  and  then

hold  the  control  key  and  bring  the  line

straight  across  about  that  far  and  then

click  again  to  create  another  point  and

then  Im  going  to  bring  the  line  down

about  this  far  but  Im  going  to  hold  the

control  key  so  that  it  locks  it  onto  a

75  degree  angle  and  if  you  look  in  the

status  bar  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen

itll  show  you  which  angle  you  currently

have  the  line  going  at  so  if  I  move  it

around  you  can  see  this  angle  changes  I

want  the  angle  to  be  75  degrees  so  Ill

move  it  about  that  far

and  again  while  Im  holding  control

click  to  add  a  point  and  then  bring  this

line  straight  across  about  that  far  like

that  and  then  press  the  enter  key  to

close  the  path  now  well  come  over  here

to  the  stroke  style  tab  under  the  fill

and  stroke  Tab  and  I  want  to  hold  up  on

this  plus  icon  to  make  this  stroke

thicker  or  give  it  a  heavier

weight  and  I  want  it  to  have  rounded

caps  as  well  so  Ill  click  on  this

rounded  caps  button  and  I  want  it  to

have  rounded  Corners  as  well  or  rounded

joins  so  Ill  select  that  option  as  well

and  now  Im  going  to  grabb  the  rectangle

tool  let  me  press  the  Escape  key  to

deselect  everything  there  and  Ill  click

and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  going  over

the  object  like

this  and  Ill  convert  that  to  a  path  by

going  to  path  and  selecting  object  to

path  and  Ill  grab  the  nodes  tool  and

Ill  take  this  node  and  bring  this  down

and  over  like  that  we  want  the  top  Edge

and  the  right  Edge  going  straight  like  a

90Â°  angle  and  then  down  here  this  bottom

Edge  dips  down

and  you  can  resize  this  as  needed  so  Im

going  to  resize  this  Im  going  to  scale

this  down  to  make  sure  to  hold  the

control  key  while  you  scale  it  down  to

preserve  the  aspect

ratio  and  I  noticed  that  this  part  of

the  cart  down  here  sticks  out  a  little

too  far  so  Ill  grab  my  nodes  tool  and

Ill  just  bring  that  node  in  a  little

bit  and  Ill  hold  control  while  Im

doing  that  so  it  locks  it  onto  the

horizontal

axis  now  Ill  select  the  basket  of  the

cart  and  Im  going  to  apply  the  corner

is  life  path  effect  as

well  select  each  of  these  nodes  by

clicking  on  both  of  them  or  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  both  of  them  and

then  grab  the  white  knot  and  bring  that

in  like  that  just  to  give  them  rounded

Corners  like

that  now  Im  going  to  add  some  Wheels  to

the  cart  so  let  me  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  Ill  click  and  drag  Ill

hold  the  control  key  and  click  and  drag

to  draw  a  perfectly  round  circle  like

that  grab  the  selection  tool  place  it

right  under  the  cart  duplicate  it  by

right  clicking  it  and  going  to  duplicate

and  then  hold  your  control  key  and  click

and  drag  this  straight  across  like  that

and  now  what  Ill  do  is  for  one  final

step  Ill  click  on  this  part  of  the  cart

go  back  to  the  nodes  tool  add  the  corner

live  path  effect  and  then  click  on  this

node  right  here  and  just  make  this

rounded  using  that

knot  there  we  go  once  youre  finished

you  can  click  the  square  icon  to  convert

this  to  a  path  and  then  youre  going  to

want  to  convert  the  stroke  to  a  path  as

well  so  well  go  to  path  and  select

stroke  to

path  and  we  can  select  everything  now

and  go  to  path  Union  and  now  we  have  a

shopping  cart

icon  now  lets  go  over  how  to  create

this  sword

icon  Im  going  to  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  and  Ill  hold  my  control

key  and  click  and  drag  to  draw  a

perfectly  round  circle  Ill  grab  my

selection  tool  move  it  towards  the

bottom  of  the  page  click  off  of  the

graphic  to  deselect  it  and  then  Ill

grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  Ill  click

and  drag  a  rectangle  going  through  the

circle  about  that

wide  and  then  I  want  to  grab  my

selection  tool  select  both  of  these  go

to  the  aligned  distribute  menu  and

Center  them  up  vertically  click  off  of

it  to  deselect  everything  and  I  want  to

select  just  the  rectangle  here  and  hold

my  shift  key  and  use  this  right  arrow  to

scale  this  down  or  up  a  little  bit

depending  on  how  big  or  small  your

rectangle  is  uh  the  idea  is  we  want  Im

paying  attention  to  down  here  where  this

circle  meets  I  want  some  of  the  circles

sticking  out  between  that  from  that

rectangle  there  if  I  make  it  too  big

its  not  quite  obvious  that  theres  a

circle  there  but  if  I  make  it  smaller  it

looks  a  little  out  of  place  or  too  big

so  I  want  to  find  a  happy  medium  which  I

think  is  right  about

there  and  then  once  thats  done  I  will

bring  this  up  a  little  more  and  Im

going  to  convert  this  to  a  path  by  going

to  path  and  selecting  object  to  path  and

then  Ill  grab  my  nodes  tool  and  I  want

to  select  these  two  nodes  up  top  over

here  and  I  want  to  enable  this  setting

up  here  in  the  tool  settings  menu  that

says  show  transformation  hand  so  Ill

click  on  that  to  enable  it  and  then  I

want  to  hold  control  and  shift  and  grab

this  Arrow  right  here  and  scale  this  out

like  that  so  that  we  make  this  we  make

the  top  of  this  wider  than  the

bottom  now  we  can  disable  that  setting

with  these  two  nodes  still  selected  we

can  come  up  here  and  select  this  button

that  says  insert  new  nodes  into  selected

segments  and  then  click  on  just  that  new

node  right  there  and  then  hold  your

control  key  and  click  and  drag  it  up

like  that  to  create  the  point  of  the

sword  so  Ill  bring  it  up  a  about  that

far  and  now  well  create  the  handle  of

the  sword  so  Ill  go  back  to  my

rectangle  tool  Ill  click  and  drag  to

draw  rectangle  about  that

size  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  and

reposition

this  I  want  to  make  sure  everything  here

is  centered  so  Ill  select  everything

Center  it  up

vertically  and  select  just  this  object

right  here  and  Im  going  to  convert  this

to  a  path  Ill  go  to  path  object  to  path

Ill  go  to  my  nodes  tool  and  select

these  two  nodes  no  Im  sorry  Ill  add

the  cornner  live  path  effect  first  and

then  I  will  select  these  two  nodes  and

bring  this  hand  bring  these  Handles  in

like  this  so  that  we  have  rounded

edges  then  we  can  convert  that  to  a  path

by  clicking  the  square

icon  and  now  I  want  to  create  a  little

bit  of  separation  between  the  handle  and

the  sword  or  the  blade  of  the  sword  kind

of  like  how  I  did  over  here  you  can  see

that  separation  there  so  to  do  that

let  me  just  take  this  object  right  click

it  go  to  duplicate  make  it  white  and

bring  this  up  like  that  just  click  and

drag  this  handle  up  and  then  click  this

button  that  says  lower  selection  one

step  to  lower  it  beneath  the  black

object  and  you  can  just  take  this  handle

and  make  this  in  as  big  or  as  small  as

youd  like  it  to  be  it  may  help  to  zoom

out  and  see  exactly  how  it  looks  in

comparison  to  the  rest  of  the  objects

and  once  youre  happy  with  the  size  just

hold  shift  and  click  on  the  blade  and  go

to  path  difference

then  you  could  select  everything  and  go

to  path

Union  and  now  you  have  created  a  sword

icon  and  for  the  final  part  of  this

tutorial  I  will  demonstrate  how  to

create  this  book

icon  so  to  do  this  Im  going  to  grab  my

stars  and  polygons  tool  I  want  to  come

up  here  to  the  toolbar  and  choose  the

polygon  setting  I  want  six  corners  and

rounded  and  randomize  both  set  to  zero

and  then  Im  going  to  hold  control  and

shift  on  my  keyboard  and  click  and  drag

up  in  an  upward  motion  with  my  cursor  so

that  I  create  a  hexagon  where  the

corners  are  going  up  and  down  vertically

like  that  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool

and  put  this  towards  the  center  of  the

page  now  Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path  and  Ill  go  to  my  nodes

tool  and  I  want  to  select  these  nodes

down  here  these  three  nodes  down  here  in

the  bottom  hold  your  control  key  and

click  and  drag  them  up  about  that

far  now  Im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  click  on  the  object  to  get  the

rotation  handles  and  hold  your  control

key  and  grab  this  corner  handle  and

rotate  it  left  four  steps  so  one  2  3

four  and  when  you  do  that  you  should  see

these  left  edges  are  flat  against  the

bounding  box  of  the  object

selection  now  Ill  grab  my  nodes  tool

select  these  three  nodes  up  here  hold  my

control  key  and  click  and  drag  these  up

like

that  go  back  to  my  selection  tool  click

on  the  object  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles  and  and  now  Im  going  to  hold

control  and  rotate  it  four  steps

clockwise  so  in  the  other  direction  now

so  this  time  I  will  go  to  the  right  1  2

3  four  and  again  were  holding  control

the  whole  time  we  do  this  to  lock  it

into  15  Dee  increments  like

that  and  once  thats  done  lets

rightclick  the  object  and  go  to

duplicate  and  I  want  to  make  this  a

different  color  just  so  I  can

differentiate  it  Im  going  to  make  this

green  and  then  Ill  rightclick  this  and

duplicate  it  again  and  Ill  make  this

one  a  different  color  as  well  so  Ill

make  this  one  red  and  I  will  turn  on

snapping  by  clicking  this  magnet  icon  up

here  in  the  top  right  corner  of  the

screen  and  I  want  to  take  this  object

and  just  snap  the  corners  there  right

about  there  like  that  so  that  the  bottom

area  this  green  kind  of  looks  like  a

green  check  mark  and  once  thats  done

hold  your  shift  key  and  click  on  the

green  object  so  that  you  have  both  of

these  objects  selected  here  and  go  to

path  and  select

difference  now  Im  going  to  use  the

offset  path  effects  so  let  me  come  over

here  to  my  path  effects  menu  if  you

dont  have  a  path  effects  menu  just  go

to  path  and  select  path

effects  and  the  path  effect  Im  looking

for  is  offset  so  Im  going  to  use  this

search  box  right  here  and  type  off  and

there  it  is  right  there

offset  Ill  grab  my  nodes  tool  and  I

will  make  sure  first  of  all  make  sure

you  have  these  options  enabled  down  here

we  want  the  the  join  set  to  miter  units

this  is  not  really  important  so  you  can

ignore  that  offset  zero  and  miter  limit

4  and  then  use  these  settings  as  well

and  once  thats  set  set  I  will  grab  this

red  circle  and  click  and  drag  this  down

like

that  about  that

far  and  once  thats  done  you  can  go  to

path  object  to  path  to  finalize  that  and

now  we  can  grab  our  selection  tool

select  both  of  these  objects  click  on  it

to  get  the  rotation  handle  and  hold  your

control  key  and  rotate  it  to  the  right

one  two  two  steps  like  that  now  you  can

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

take  just  this  green  object  grab  your

nodes  to  tool  and  take  these  two  nodes

right  here  and  hold  your  control  key  and

click  and  drag  them  out  like  that  we

want  this  to  to  extend  beyond  that  black

shape  and  now  we  can  go  back  to  our

selection  tool  select  everything  let  me

turn  off  the  snapping  Now  by  clicking

this  magnet  icon  again  and  now  I  can

click  on  the  object  to  get  the  rotation

handles  and  now  Im  going  to  hold

control  and  rotate  it  to  the  left  two

steps  so  one  two  and  now  I  will  go  to

path  difference  and  that  right  there  is

the  effect  were  looking  for  so  now  I

have  to  make  the  corners  of  these  a

little  rounded  because  as  of  right  now

theyre  a  little  too  Square  so  to  do

that  Im  going  to  grab  my  nodes  tool

click  on  the  book  to  select  it  add  the

corners  live  path  effect  and  Im  going

to  select  these  four  nodes  over  here  on

the  left  and  I  will  grab  one  of  these

handles  one  of  these  white  knots  and

scale  that  in  like  that  just  to  make

these  Corners

rounded  and  then  Ill  come  over  here  and

do  the  same  thing  I  want  to  select  these

three  notes

and  give  them  a  little  bit  of  a  rounded

Edge  as

well  and  then  Ill  come  over  here  and  do

the  same  thing  select  these  nodes  on  the

right  hand  side  and  scale  them  down  its

good  to  scale  each  of  these  segments

individually  because  the  amount  that  you

want  around  them  is  going  to  be

different  for  each  side  so  its  you  get

a  better  result  doing  it  this  way  and

Ill  come  up  here  and  use  this  one  as

well  so  Ill  click  on  that  one  and  this

should  be  the  last  one  right  here  Ill

Ill  r  that  off  a  little

bit  and  there  we  go  Im  going  to  click

on  the  square  button  up  here  to  convert

to  a

path  okay  so  there  we  go  theres  the

book  icon  now  one  final  part  of  the  book

icon  if  you  notice  here  I  put  a  little

bit  of  a  bookmark  down  there  just  to

emphasize  that  its  a  book  it  makes  it

look  more  like  a  book  when  you  do  that

so  to  create  that  bookmark  Im  just

going  to  grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  Ill

click  and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  over

this  portion  of  the  object  Im  going  to

grab  my  selection  tool  click  on  it  again

to  get  the  rotation  handles  but  instead

of  rotating  were  going  to  Shear  were

going  to  use  the  icon  over  here  on  the

right  hand  side  and  hold  the  option  key

or  the  ALT  key  if  youre  on  Windows  and

just  bring  this  down  two

steps  so  that  the  edges  match  in

Direction  like  that  and  we  can  bring

this  right  about

there  and  Im  going  to  scale  that  down  a

little  bit  let  me  try  that

again  and  if  you  need  to  make  the  this

bottom  longer  or  shorter  Im  placing  it

so  that  the  top  Edge  goes  halfway

through  the  books  pages  here  and  I  want

this  to  be  a  little  outside  of  the

bottom  so  let  me  grab  the  nodes  tool  and

let  me  convert  this  to  a  path  Ill  go  to

path  object  to  path  and  now  I  can  take

those  nodes  and  hold  control  and  move

them  up  like  that  and  I  can  add  new

nodes  in  there  as  well  with  those  two

nodes  selected  I  can  click  on  this

button  over  here  that  says  add  new

nodes  and  just  select  this  node  right

here  and  move  that  up

and  now  I  want  to  create  a  little  bit  of

an  offset  between  the  book  and  the

bookmark  so  let  me  make  this  black  and

let  me  right  click  this  and  go  to

duplicate  Ill  make  the  duplicate  copy

white  and  Ill  hold  control  and  shift

and  scale  it  up  and  I  want  to  lower  it

beneath  the  black  object  so  Ill  click

on  the  lower  selection  one  step  and  then

I  can  just  scale  this  up  or  down

depending  on  how  much  I  want  the  offset

to  be  and  again  Im  holding  control  and

shift  while  I  do  this  to  scale  it  from

the  center

and  then  once  youre  happy  with  how  it

looks  hold  shift  and  click  on  the  book

and  go  to  path

difference  and  now  we  can  select  both

objects  and  go  to  path  Union  and  we  have

created  our  book

icon  so  that  should  do  it  for  todays

tutorial  we  have  created  all  six  of

these  icons  using  nothing  but  simple

shapes  in  inkscape  if  you  have  any
