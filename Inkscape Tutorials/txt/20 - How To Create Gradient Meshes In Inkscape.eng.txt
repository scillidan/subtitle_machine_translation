in  this  lesson  well  be  going  over  how

to  use  mesh  gradients  which  is  in  my

opinion  the  most  advanced  feature  in

inkscape  so  if  you  can  get  the  hang  of

how  to  use  this  then  you  should  be

pretty  Limitless  with  the  rest  of  the

software  before  we  get  started  though  I

would  recommend  that  you  save  your

document  and  get  in  the  habit  of

pressing  Ctrl  s  every  few  steps  because

this  tool  can  be  a  little  glitchy  at

times  and  you  may  experience  some

crashing  so  it  would  be  good  to  save

your  work  so  that  you  dont  lose  your

progress

so  to  get  started  Im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  on  my  canvas  to  draw  a

rectangle  like  that

and  Im  going  to  take  this  rounded

handle  over  here  and  bring  this  all  the

way  down  so  that  we  have  rounded  ends  so

that  we  have  this  pill  like  shape

and  then  Im  going  to  convert  that  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path

so  what  I  will  do  now  is  I  will  come

over  here  to  my  meshes  tool  you  can

locate  it  over  here  in  the  toolbar  Im

going  to  click  on  that

and  the  way  this  tool  works  is  it  allows

you  to  assign  colors  to  an  object  based

on  a  grid  of  coordinate  points  and

theres  two  different  ways  that  you  can

do  this  you  have  regular  mesh  gradients

and  then  you  have  conical  gradients  and

you  can  apply  it  to  the  fill  or  you  can

apply  to  the  stroke  so  Im  going  to  show

you  how  to  use  both  of  these  starting

off  with  the  regular  mesh  gradient

so  if  you  notice  up  here  in  the  tool

settings  youll  see  we  have  two

different  settings  here  we  have  rows  and

columns

Im  going  to  start  off  with  just  two

rows  and  two  columns  so  if  yours  doesnt

say  two  and  two  just  manually  type  in

two  and  two  and  then  take  your  cursor

and  click  and  drag  over  your  object  like

that  and  youll  see  that  we  now  have  a

grid  of  coordinate  points  placed  over

the  object

what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  over  all  of  those

coordinate  points  and  Im  going  to

change  their  color  to  something  like

pink  down  here  you  could  choose  whatever

color  youd  like  just  choose  a  mid-tone

nothing  too  light  or  too  dark

and  what  Im  going  to  do  now  is  Im

going  to  press  escape  to  deselect  those

nodes  and  Im  going  to  click  on  this

node  right  here  Im  just  going  to  bring

this  towards  the  edge  of  the  rectangle

right  there  and  Im  going  to  take  these

handles  and  just  straighten  them  out

like  that  or  rather  round  them  so  that

they  they  go  along  the  Contour  of  this

object  here  and  you  may  have  to  take

these  handles  and  move  them  up  a  little

bit  to  accommodate  that  spacing

and  Im  just  going  to  adjust  these

handles  so  that  we  have  the  edge  of  this

mesh  going  around  the  Contour  of  the

object

a  little  more  smoothly

Ill  take  this  handle  move  this  out  a

little  more

Ill  adjust  this  one  down  a  little  bit

and  again  we  want  a  nice  smooth  Contour

there  it  doesnt  have  to  be  perfect

youre  probably  not  going  to  get  it

perfect  but  close  enough  is  good  enough

there  like  that  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  with  this  node  here  I  want  these  I

want  my  mesh  to  nicely  hug  the  Contour

of  my  object  so  Im  going  to  adjust  all

of  these  handles  here  until  I  have  that

result

and  then  Im  going  to  come  over  here  to

this  side  and  do  the  same  thing  Ill

move  this  one  out  a  little  bit

Im  going  to  move  this  Im  going  to  move

this  node  in  close  to  the  edge  and  Ill

take  these  handles  and  just  move  them

out  like  that

and  once  youve  done  that  Im  going  to

take  this  node  here  in  the  center  and

Im  going  to  bring  this  down  like  this

and  then  Im  going  to  use  these  handles

over  here  to  make  it  so  that  this  line

kind  of  like  dips  down  kind  of  kind  of

sort  of  like  follows  the  Contour  of  the

shape  here  Ill  do  this  with  both  sides

as  well  I  want  to  bring  this  down  like

that

and  now  what  we  can  do  is  we  can  click

on  each  of  these  coordinate  points  and

change  their  colors  so  if  I  click  on

this  coordinate  point  right  here

I  can  hold  shift  and  click  on  this

coordinate  point  over  here  as  well  I

have  them  both  selected  now  and  then  Im

going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  this

coordinate  point  over  here  and  now  I

have  all  three  of  those  coordinate

points  selected  and  Im  going  to  change

the  color  here  just  by  darkening  it  a

little  bit  and  you  can  see  we  end  up

with  the  result  like  that

and  then  Ill  do  the  same  thing  down

here  Ill  select  these  coordinate  points

by  holding  shift  and  clicking  on  them

and  Ill  make  these  ones  even  darker

so  you  can  see  the  result  were  getting

here  it  kind  of  looks  like  a  3D  pill  now

if  you  notice  we  have  a  little  bit  of  a

little  bit  of  color  error  here  so  Im

going  to  click  on  this  handle  right  here

and  Im  going  to  bring  this  handle  up

just  to  adjust  this  a  little  bit  just  to

make  this  a  little  more  smooth

there  we  go  you  may  have  to  bring  it  up

a  little  bit

and  I  would  recommend  coming  up  here  to

the  smoothing  and  changing  this  from

Koontz  to  bicubic  and  thatll  make

things  just  look  even  more  smooth

so  now  we  have  dark  we  have  a  darker

gradient  here  on  the  bottom  Im  going  to

put  a  lighter  gradient  up  top  here  so

Im  going  to  double  click  this  line

right  here

and  thats  going  to  allow  us  to  create  a

new  line  there  let  me  actually  undo  that

Im  going  to  press  Ctrl  Z  to  undo  that

Im  going  to  put  that  a  little  lower

there  we  go  and  Ill  bring  this  handle

and  move  this  up

Ill  take  this  handle  and  bring  it  down

and  Im  going  to  click  on  this  node

right  here  and  Im  going  to  move  this

handle  so  that  the  Contour  is  going  up

now  like  that  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  on  this  side  Ill  bring  this

up  like  that

and  now  I  will  click  on  this  node  right

here  and  I  will  make  this  white  and  you

can  see  the  effect  there  now  it  kind  of

looks  like  a  3D  pill  now  if  you  want  to

add  even  more  in  here  you  can  you  can

add  more  points  to  this  grid  so  Im

going  to  double  click  the  line  over  here

and  now  we  have  another  point  to  work

with  Im  going  to  click  on  that  one  and

Im  going  to  make  this  one  white

and  then  Ill  do  the  same  thing  over

here  Ill  click  on  this  one  or  double

click  on  this  one  and  make  that  white

there  we  go  and  if  I  zoom  out  and  go  to

my  selection  tool  you  can  see  what  weve

done  there  weve  used  the  mesh  gradient

to  create  this  3D  pill  looking  shape

so  thats  how  the  mesh  gradient  Works

lets  have  a  look  at  the  conical

gradient  now

now  lets  have  a  look  at  how  to  use

conical  gradients  Im  going  to  grab  my

circles  and  Ellipsis  tool  over  here  for

this  demonstration  were  going  to  create

a  CD  so  Im  going  to  click  and  drag  to

create  a  circle  Im  going  to  hold  the

control  key  so  we  have  a  perfectly  round

circle  like  that

and  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  and

move  this  towards  the  center  of  the  page

and  zoom  on  zoom  in  on  it  a  little  bit

Im  going  to  come  back  over  here  to  my

meshes  tool  and  now  Im  going  to  come  up

here  and  select  this  option  that  says

create  conical  gradient  and  this  works

similarly  to  the  regular  mesh  instead  of

putting  it  on  a  rectangular  grid  though

it  wraps  it  around  a  circle

so  to  show  you  what  I  mean  Im  going  to

change  the  rows  and  columns  this  time  I

want  one  row  and  I  want  20  columns  20  is

the  maximum  value  for  either  of  these

input  boxes  here  so  Im  going  to  go  with

1  and  20  and  now  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  like  that  and  you  can  see  we  now

have  these  nodes  going  in  the  direction

of  a  circle  rather  than  on  a  rectangular

grid

so  let  me  select  all  of  these  and  Im

going  to  change  their  color  to  30  gray

you  can  access  that  by  coming  down  here

to  the  color  bar  and  hovering  your

cursor  over  the  colors  if  you  notice

right  here  it  says  30  gray  Im  going  to

choose  that  one

and  now  all  of  these  are  20  gray  and  now

Im  going  to  press  the  Escape  key  to

deselect  them

and  now  Im  going  to  zoom  in  over  here

Im  looking  at  the  top  Center  Line  right

here  Im  going  to  double  click  this  part

of  the  line  right  here  right  between

these  two  lines  to  add  a  new  line  in

here  just  like  that  and  Ill  come  over

here  and  add  a  new  line  on  this  side  as

well  Ill  double  click  that  line

and  then  Im  going  to  come  down  here  and

do  the  same  thing  to  the  bottom  side  Im

going  to  starting  off  with  the  center

line  as  a  reference  move  over  here  to

the  left  and  put  a  new  line  in  here  and

then  Ill  come  over  to  the  right  side

and  do  the  same  thing

and  now  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  click  on  this  line  right  here

now  when  you  click  on  the  line  youre

going  to  select  its  going  to  select  the

entire  area  right  there  and  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  Im  going  to  click  on

this  line  to  select  that  as  well  and  now

I  have  both  of  those  lines  selected  and

Im  going  to  change  their  color  to

Yellow

and  Im  going  to  make  this  a  lighter

shade  of  yellow  over  here

and  now  Im  going  to  select  the  lines

next  to  it  so  Im  going  to  come  over

here  and  click  on  this  line  right  here

to  the  left  and  then  Ill  hold  shift  and

click  on  this  line  right  here  to  the

right

and  then  Ill  come  down  here  and  do  the

same  thing  Im  going  to  hold  shift  click

on  this  line  right  here

to  select  it  and  youll  know  its

selected  when  you  see  that  node

highlighted  and  then  Ill  hold  shift  and

click  on  this  line  as  well  now  one  thing

I  want  to  point  out  when  youre  doing

this  is  to  make  sure  that  youre

selecting  your  line  youre  going  to

hover  your  cursor  over  the  line  and  when

its  directly  placed  over  the  line

youll  notice  that  a  plus  symbol

populates  on  the  cursor  letting  you  know

that  its  active  now  make  sure  you  see

that  plus  symbol  because  if  its  not

there  and  you  accidentally  click  youre

going  to deselect  the  object  and  youre

going  to  have  to  start  all  over  again

with  your  selection  so  Im  going  to  hold

shift  and  click  on  that  and  now  I  have

all  four  of  those  lines  selected  Im

going  to  change  their  color  to  Pink

and  Im  going  to  bring  down

the  lightness  of  that  as  well  so  that  we

end  up  with  something  like  that  right

there

and  now  Im  going  to  do  the  same  thing

again  over  here  Im  going  to  select  this

line  out  here

hold  shift  select  this  line  over  here

and  then  come  down  here  and  do  the  same

thing  on  this  side  select  this  line

and  then  this  line

and  these  ones  Im  going  to  make  cyan

and  again  Ill  use  a  lighter  shade  here

and  now  I  want  to  make  it  look  like  the

disc  is  reflecting  a  glare  of  light  so

Im  going  to  select  this  line  right  here

and  then  hold  shift  and  select  this  line

over  here  on  the  other  side  and  I  will

make  those  ones  white  so  that  it  looks

like  its  a  little  glare  of  light

so  you  can  see  what  we  have  here  its

starting  to  look  like  a  CD

so  now  that  we  have  that  in  place  Im

going  to  create  another  object  on  top  of

this  and  apply  a  mesh  gradient  to  that

as  well  so  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool

click  on  the  object  and  then  right  click

it  and  go  to  duplicate  and  Im  just

going  to  change  the  color  of  the  entire

object  Im  just  going  to  make  that  white

just  to  clear  that  mesh  that  was

previously  on  there

and  now  Im  going  to  go  back  to  my

meshes  tool  and  now  Im  going  to  use  the

opposite  values  instead  of  one  row  and

20  columns  Im  going  to  use  20  rows  and

one  column

and  now  Im  going  to  click  and  drag  like

that  and  now  we  have  our  conical

gradient  going  in  circles  as  opposed  to

lines

so  let  me  select  all  of  these  nodes  here

and  remove  their  color  by  clicking  on

the  Red  X  down  here

and  now  what  I  want  to  do  is  let  me

press  escape  to  deselect  them  I  want  to

select  each  node  here

I  want  to  select  every  other  node  going

up  this  vertical  plane  right  here  so  I

selected  this  node  Im  going  to  hold

shift  Im  going  to  skip  this  node  and

Im  going  to  select  the  next  one  and  Im

just  going  to  repeat  that  going  all  the

way  up  Im  going  to  select  every  other

node  while  holding  shift  so  that  I  have

them  all  selected

and  once  youve  done  that  you  can  fill

them  in  with  white  and  now  we  have  that

sort  of  effect  right  there  and  Im  going

to  come  down  here  to  the  bottom  and  do

the  same  thing  Ill  select  this  node  and

again  every  other  node  going  down  this

vertical  plane

and  then  finally  I  want  to  make  these

areas  if  you  notice  the  gradient  sort  of

ends  right  here  this  right  hand  side  is

the  end  point  of  the  gradient  so  I  want

to  make  these  areas  white  as  well  Im

going  to  select  these  lines  right  here

Im  going  to  click  on  the  line  itself  as

opposed  to  just  the  node  and  Im  going

to  hold  shift  and  go  through  here  and

select  each  of  the  lines  as  well  and

again  not  just  the  node  but  the  entire

line  we  want  the  whole  segment  selected

and  then  I  will  make  those  white

just  like  that  and  now  Im  going  to  grab

my  selection  tool  Im  going  to  change

the  blend  mode  of  this  object  Im  going

to come  over  here  to  my  fill  and  stroke

menu  if  you  see  over  here  where  it  says

blend  mode  just  click  on  that  and  change

this  to  color  burn

and  now  we  have  that  effect  right  there

so  Im  going  to  bring  down  the  opacity

of  this  a  little  bit  we  dont  want  that

to  be  too  prominent  Im  going  to  bring

that  down  a  little  bit

and  now  Im  going  to  create  some  more

circles  to  place  on  top  of  here  so  it

looks  more  like  a  CD  so  let  me  grab  my

circles  and  ellipses  tool  let  me  click

and  drag  to  create  another  Circle

Im  holding  control  while  I  do  that  to

lock  the  aspect  ratio  and  let  me  bring

the  opacity  of  this  up  and  let  me  make

this  a  darker  shade  of  gray  something

like  60  percent

and  Ill  place  this  directly  over  the

center  of  the  circle  here  Im  going  to

hold  shift  and  select  both  of  these  and

Im  going  to  Center  them  up  vertically

and  horizontally  make  sure  you  have

relative  two  make  sure  you  have  that  to

last  selected  and  again  if  you  dont

have  your  outline  distribute  menu  active

you  can  open  it  by  going  to  object  and

selecting  a  line  and  distribute  which  is

down  here  at  the  bottom  of  the  list

and  once  thats  centered  let  me  deselect

it  Im  going  to  take  just  this  object

right  here  and  Im  going  to  hold  Ctrl

and  shift  and  just  scale  this  down  like

that

and  Im  going  to  change  the  blend  mode

of  this  one  as  well  let  me  come  back

over  here  to  my  fill  and  stroke  menu  Im

going  to  change  the  Blends  mode  to  I

think  this  one  is  multiply  there  we  go

yeah  now  we  have  multiply  and  let  me

duplicate  this  again  Im  going  to  right

click  this  and  go  to  duplicate  Ill  make

this  one  white

and  Ill  change  the  blend  mode  of  this

back  to  normal

and  Ill  just  scale  this  down  like  that

and  now  it  looks  sort  of  like  a  compact

disc  and  you  can  change  you  can  adjust

the  size  of  these  circles  if  you  want

Im  just  eyeballing  this  here  I  dont

know  if  this  accurately  represents  the

proportions  of  a  CD  but  that  looks  close

enough  and  then  finally  Ill  put  one

more  circle  behind  the  disk  sort  of  like

as  a  bevel  so  Ill  take  this  one  here

Ill  right  click  it  go  to  duplicate

Ill  make  this  one  a  lighter  shade  of

gray  maybe  20  percent

Ill  scale  this  up

send  it  all  the  way  to  the  back  by

clicking  this  button  up  here  that  says

lower  to  the  bottom

and  Ill  just  resize  this  accordingly

Ill  make  that  a  little  smaller

and  Ill  maybe  even  make  that  a  little

darker  just  so  it  stands  out  a  little

more

and  there  you  go  we  have  used  conical

gradients  to  create  that  CD  design

so  that  is  how  you  can  work  with  mesh

gradients  and  conical  gradients  in

inkscape

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as
