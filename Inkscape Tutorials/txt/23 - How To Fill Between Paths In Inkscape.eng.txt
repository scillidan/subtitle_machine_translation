in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  fill  between  paths  using

inkscape  and  to  show  you  what  I  mean  I

have  this  series  of  individual  lines  on

my  screen  here  if  I  grab  my  nodes  tool

you  can  see  these  are  just  independent

paths

and  if  I  select  all  of  these  paths  and

try  to  apply  a  fill  color  you  can  see

that  nothing  happens  there  because  these

shapes  between  these  paths  arent

actually  shapes  this  is  just  empty  space

that  takes  on  the  appearance  of  a  shape

so  if  I  want  to  fill  in  these  spaces  we

have  to  use  a  different  approach

so  theres  actually  several  different

ways  that  you  can  do  this  and  the  method

that  you  should  use  depends  on  which

result  youre  going  for  so  lets  have  a

closer  look  if  I  select  all  of  these

shapes  right  here  I  can  go  to  path  and

choose  fracture

and  what  happens  is  it  creates

independent  shapes  out  of  all  of  those

empty  spaces  there  and  now  you  can  just

select  them  and  go  and  change  their

colors  as  youd  like

another  way  that  you  can  do  this  is  by

using  the  shape  Builder  tool  if  I  select

all  of  these  shapes  and  go  into  the

shape  Builder  tool  I  can  get  the  same

result  as  fracture  the  only  difference

now  is  that  I  can  make  I  can  combine

some  of  these  shapes  together  so  I  can

create  this  cube-like  effect  like  that

now  the  problem  with  using  this  approach

is  that  it  doesnt  just  fill  in  those

empty  spaces  it  also  gets  rid  of  the  uh

the  lines  that  I  had  there  so  if  you

want  to  do  this  in  such  a  way  that  you

can  fill  between  these  paths  and  still

preserve  these  paths  one  way  to  do  that

would  be  to  use  the  paint  bucket  tool  so

Im  going  to  come  over  here  and  grab  the

paint  bucket  tool  in  the  in  the  toolbar

you  can  also  access  it  by  pressing  the

letter  U  on  your  keyboard

and  well  come  up  here  to  the  tool

settings  menu  and  make  sure  you  have  the

fill  by  set  to  visible  colors  make  sure

your  threshold  is  set  to  50.  well  start

out  at  50  and  if  we  need  to  adjust  it

well  increase  or  decrease  it  grow  and

Shrink  make  sure  you  have  that  set  to

zero  and  close  gaps  set  to  none

now  you  can  choose  a  fill  color  that

youd  like  to  use  its  indicated  up  here

in  the  top  right  corner  you  can  see  as

of  right  now  green  is  my  fill  color  if  I

want  to  change  my  fill  color  I  could

just  come  down  here  to  the  color  bar  and

pick  one  of  these  other  colors

and  now  if  I  click  on  one  of  these  empty

spaces  it  fills  in  that  empty  space  with

the  new  Vector  shape

now  if  I  zoom  in  on  this  you  can  see

where  this  effect  is  not  perfect  you  can

see  there  are  a  little  bit  of  gaps  in

there  it  didnt  exactly  fill  it  in

precisely  so  let  me  undo  that  by

pressing  Ctrl  Z  or  command  Z  if  youre

on  Mac  and  Im  going  to  come  up  here  to

the  tool  settings  what  we  can  choose  to

do  is  we  can  choose  to  grow  or  Shrink

The  Fill  using  this  setting  right  here

so  if  I  increase  this  to  0.7

and  try  that  again

you  can  see  it  fills  it  in  better  as  you

can  see  there  but  the  problem  now  is

that  its  overlapping  some  of  the  path

here  so  what  youll  want  to  do  is  grab

your  select  tool  and  then  just  lower

this  beneath  the  pads  like  that  and  now

you  can  grab  the  paint  bucket  tool  again

and  proceed  to  fill  in  the  other  colors

now  if  you  want  to  change  colors  while

youre  filling  them  in  make  sure  to

press  the  Escape  key  so  you  can  deselect

whatever  object  you  currently  have

selected  and  then  you  can  choose  your

next  color  like  that

and  then  press  Escape  when  you  want  to

choose  another  color  again

and  then  you  could  fill  it  like  that

okay  so  now  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  take  all  of  my  shapes  here  Im

going  to  select  them  all

and  Im  going  to  send  them  all  to  the

back  so  that  we  can  see  the  paths  on  top

of  them

and  you  can  see  again  this  approach  is

not  perfect  we  have  these  gaps  in  here

despite  using  despite  changing  those

settings  so  Im  going  to  grab  my  nodes

tool  and  Im  going  to  take  these  nodes

and  move  them  and  adjust  them  so  that

everything  here  is  filled  in  accurately

and  there  we  go  foreign

so  one  thing  to  keep  in  mind  when  using

the  paint  bucket  tool  is  if  I  fill  in

this  shape  right  here  I  have  a  shape  but

if  I  try  doing  that  over  here  it  doesnt

work  and  the  reason  why  is  because  if  I

zoom  in  you  can  see  there  is  a  gap

between  these  paths  here  meaning  this  is

all  open  space  the  paint  bucket  tool

mostly  only  works  on  closed  spaces  there

are  no  gaps  here  so  it  worked  over  here

there  is  a  setting  that  you  can  use  to

change  this  though  so  if  I  come  up  here

to  the  tool  settings  where  it  says  close

gaps  I  can  start  off  with  small  and  see

if  that  works  so  Ill  set  it  to  small

and  click  on  it

okay  so  this  is  this  must  be  larger  than

what  inkscapes  considers  to  be  a  small

Gap  so  Im  going  to  try  medium  now

because  that  didnt  work  so  lets  try

medium

there  we  go

and  this  time  it  works  so  based  on  the

size  of  the  of  the  gaps  between  your

paths  go  ahead  and  cycle  through  those

options  there  to  see  if  one  of  those

will  work  if  youre  encountering  that

problem

so  all  of  the  methods  that  weve  gone

over  at  this  point  have  been  imperfect

in  some  way  lets  go  over  a  workflow

that  is  perfect  what  Im  going  to  do  is

Im  going  to  select  my  paths  here  and

Im  going  to  combine  them  together  by

going  to  path  and  selecting  combine

now  Im  going  to  duplicate  that  Im

going  to  right  click  it  and  go  to

duplicate

and  now  Im  going  to  apply  the  fracture

to  this  duplicated  path  here  so  Ill  go

to  path  and  select  fracture

and  now  I  can  change  the  colors  of  my

shapes  and  I  could  remove  The  Stroke  by

holding  shift  and  clicking  on  this  red  X

over  here  and  now  I  can  send  them  to  the

back  and  this  workflow  right  here  gives

you  the  best  result  the  only  problem

with  this  method  here  is  that  now  you

have  to  go  and  change  all  of  these

colors  individually  if  you  need  the

colors  to  be  different

so  that  is  how  you  can  go  about  filling

between  paths  using  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching  foreign
