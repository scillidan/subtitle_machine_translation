this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  giving  you  a

brief  overview  of  all  21  of  Inkscape

stools

Ive  even  put  together  a  written

overview  that  you  can  use  for  a  quick

reference  anytime  youd  like  Ill  have  a

link  to  that  in  the  description  of  the

video  and  if  youd  like  a  more  in-depth

explanation  of  these  tools  along  with

every  other  feature  in  Inkscape  be  sure

to  check  out  my  Inkscape  masterclass

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  Inkscape  and  I  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works

Ill  have  a  link  to  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  as  well  lets

have  a  look  at  the  Select  tool  to  get  us

started  because  this  is  the  tool  that

youll  probably  be  using  most  often  the

Select  tool  as  the  name  suggests  allows

you  to  select  individual  or  multiple

objects  at  a  time  you  can  also  use  it  to

make  some  common  transformation  to  your

objects  like  scaling  rotating  and

shearing

the  Edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  allows  you

to  transform  the  structural  properties

of  an  object  by  altering  the  individual

coordinate  points  of  that  object

otherwise  known  as  nodes  you  can

reposition  them  add  new  nodes  delete

nodes  and  even  change  node  type  whether

it  be  a  sharp  corner  or  a  rounded  edge

the  tool  also  allows  you  to  change  the

contours  of  an  objects  lines  by

manually  moving  them  or  by  adjusting  the

handles  of  its  nearest  node

the  squares  and  rectangles  tool  is  used

to  create  four-sided  vector  objects

whether  it  be  a  rectangle  or  a  perfectly

symmetrical  square  by  default  your

rectangle  will  have  sharp  corners  but

you  can  use  the  little  round  node  at  the

top  right  to  give  you  a  rectangle  of

rounded  corners  you  can  easily  switch

back  to  sharp  corners  anytime  youd  like

by  clicking  the  make  corners  sharp

button  in  the  tool  settings  menu

the  circles  and  ellipses  tool  is  used  to

create  vector  shapes  with  curved  edges

like  ellipses  and  perfectly  round

circles  it  can  also  be  used  to  create

partial  ellipses  by  maneuvering  this

circular  handle  at  the  right  edge  of  the

shape  keeping  your  cursor  outside  of  the

ellipse  will  allow  you  to  change  it  by

its  radius  whereas  moving  your  cursor  to

the  inside  of  the  circle  will  allow  you

to  change  a  by  its  diameter  at  any  point

you  can  reset  the  shape  back  to  being  an

ellipse  in  the  tool  settings  menu

the  stars  and  polygons  tool  is  used  to

create  multi-sided  objects  its  divided

up  into  two  separate  functions  one  for

stars  and  one  for  polygons

when  creating  stars  youll  be  able  to

set  the  number  of  corners  the  star  has

the  spoke  ratio  between  each  star  and

you  can  choose  to  give  your  star  rounded

corners  as  well  if  youd  like

when  creating  polygons  youll  be  able  to

set  the  number  of  sides  and  corners  and

you  can  choose  to  make  them  round  it  if

youd  like  this  can  all  be  done  in  the

tool  settings  menu  or  by  manually

adjusting  the  handles  directly  on  the

canvas

the  3d  boxes  tool  allows  you  to  quickly

create  three-sided  vector  boxes  that

appear  as  if  theyre  three-dimensional

the  X  Y  and  z-axis  can  be  adjusted

independently  in  order  to  determine  the

boxs  width  height  and  depth  the  red

lines  represent  the  height  of  the  box

the  blue  lines  represent  the  width  of

the  box  and  the  yellow  lines  represent

the  boxs  depth  you  can  also  change  the

perspective  of  the  box  by  moving  the

nodes  associated  with  the  red  and  yellow

lines

the  spirals  tool  is  used  to  create

vector  objects  that  follow  a  spiral  path

the  tool  allows  you  to  adjust  the  number

of  turns  the  spiral  has  as  well  as  its

divergence  from  its  center  point  this

can  be  done  either  in  the  tool  settings

menu  or  directly  on  the  canvas

the  Bezier  pen  is  used  for  manually

drawing  your  own  vector  shapes  by

creating  a  series  of  nodes  and  lines  you

can  make  both  straight  and  curved  lines

as  well  as  sharpen  rounded  corners  the

tool  also  has  a  variety  of  settings

built  in  including  spiral  paths  and  B

splines  each  of  which  determines  how  the

pen  behaves  they  can  be  used  to  force

any  behavior  youd  like

including  curved  lines  rounded  corners

parallel  lines  and  more

the  free  hand  lines  tool  functions  much

like  the  Bezier  pen  only  it  allows  you

to  draw  your  shapes  with  your  hands

movement  as  opposed  to  clicking  to

create  a  bunch  of  nodes  this  would  make

it  more  ideal  if  you  were  using  a

drawing  tablet  or  some  kind  of  stylus

much  like  the  Bezier  pen  the  freehand

aligns  tool  has  various  settings  built

in  that  will  dictate  the  tools  behavior

the  calligraphy  pen  allows  you  to  create

freehand  vector  objects  using  a  classic

brushstroke  and  shape  of  your  choosing

the  tool  has  various  presets  built-in

that  will  determine  the  size  and  shape

of  your  brushstrokes  theres  also  a

variety  of  settings  that  you  can  tweak

to  dictate  how  the  tool  will  behave

the  text  objects  tool  is  used  to  create

vector  text  and  wording  of  your  choosing

it  allows  you  to  flow  your  text  into  a

bounding  box  or  simply  generate  it  all

on  a  single  line  you  can  also  use  the

tool  settings  to  adjust  the  font  size

orientation  spacing  between  letters  and

words  as  well  as  various  other

adjustments

the  gradients  tool  allows  you  to  color

your  objects  with  multiple  colors  that

fade  into  each  other  otherwise  known  as

gradients  the  tool  allows  you  to  edit

your  gradients  based  on  colors  used

number  of  colors  and  the  position  of  the

color  is  relative  to  the  object  that

its  being  applied  to  the  gradients  can

follow  either  a  straight  linear  path  or

a  rounded  radio

the  meshs  tool  functions  similarly  to

the  gradients  tool  only  it  allows  you  to

give  your  objects  a  gradient  that

follows  either  a  grid  otherwise  known  as

a  mesh  gradient  or  a  cone  otherwise

known  as  a  conical  gradient  you  can  use

the  tool  to  manually  alter  the  points  of

your  meshes  and  cones  directly  on  the

canvas

the  pick  colors  from  an  image  tool

commonly  referred  to  as  the  dropper

allows  you  to  set  an  objects  filling

stroke  color  based  on  another  objects

color  the  tool  allows  you  to  sample

colors  from  both  vector  objects  and

rasterized  images  your  selected  object

will  be  filled  with  whatever  color  you

sample  from  the  other  object  you  can

also  hold  shift  while  sampling  to  set

the  selection  as  your  objects  stroke

color  you  can  also  click  and  drag  to

create  a  selection  that  the  tool  will

use  to  generate  an  average  color  of  the

colors  in  that  area

the  fill  bounded  areas  tool  commonly

referred  to  as  the  bucket  tool  allows

you  to  fill  empty  spaces  with  the

predetermined  fill  color  in  order  for

the  tool  to  work  the  area  youre  filling

in  must  be  completely  surrounded  by  a

closed  path  it  will  not  work  on  empty

spaces  that  bleed  out  into  the  open

canvas  the  tool  will  reference  whatever

you  have  set  as  the  fill  and  Stroke

color  for  filling  in  your  objects

the  tweak  objects  tool  allows  you  to

make  compound  alterations  to  multiple

objects  pads  and  colors  all  at  once

alterations  include  moving  multiple

objects  at  once  shrinking  them  rotating

them  or  duplicating  them  it  also  allows

you  to  make  adjustments  based  on  colors

and  blurs

the  spray  objects  tool  allows  you  to

generate  multiple  objects  by  spraying

them  onto  your  canvas  the  objects  that

are  sprayed  is  determined  by  the  object

you  have  selected  at  the  moment  the  tool

has  a  variety  of  settings  that  will

allow  you  to  adjust  certain  behaviors

like  whether  or  not  the  objects  overlap

the  size  of  the  scatter  area  whether  or

not  to  rotate  the  sprayed  objects  and

more

the  eraser  tool  is  used  to  delete

segments  of  a  vector  path  in  a  freestyle

technique  that  is  based  on  your  hands

movement  the  tool  can  work  on  multiple

objects  at  a  time  and  it  has  a  variety

of  settings  built-in  that  will  allow  you

to  dictate  how  the  tool  behaves  it

should  be  noted  though  that  this  tool

only  work  on  vector  paths  it  wont  work

on  text  objects  and  rasterized  images

the  diagram  connectors  tool  allows  you

to  create  diagrams  by  generating  pads

and  boxes  that  link  objects  together

much  like  every  other  tool  it  has  a

variety  of  settings  built-in  that  allows

you  to  dictate  how  the  tool  behaves

whether  it  be  avoiding  selected  objects

or  ignoring  selected  objects

the  zoom  tool  allows  you  to  increase  or

decrease  your  view  of  the  canvas  you  can

zoom  in  to  see  fine  details  zoom  out  to

get  a  more  complete  view  of  the  canvas

or  set  the  view  ratio  to  one-to-one  in

order  to  see  how  the  canvas  looks  at

full  size

the  measurement  tool  allows  you  to

measure  any  object  based  on  its  length

width  height  radius  or  diameter  it

allows  you  to  choose  from  a  variety  of

measurement  units  including  pixels

inches  centimeters  millimeters  and  more

the  tool  also  has  a  setting  built-in

that  allows  you  to  convert  your

measurement  into  an  object  that  you  can

work  with  further  and  export  as  a

graphic  of  its  own

and  that  should  do  it  for  all  of

Inkscape  stools  as  a  version  1.0  if  you
