when  inkscape  released  version  1.0

earlier  this  year  they  made  a  pretty  big

change  to  the  way  that  the  stroke  to

path  function  works

and  it  was  significant  enough  that  it

actually  broke  some  of  my  older

tutorials

so  i  wanted  to  put  this  video  together

to  address  this  problem  and  how  you  can

work  around  it  if  youre  following  along

with  one  of  my  older  tutorials

and  getting  stuck  on  the  stroke  to  path

part



so  on  my  screen  here  i  have  two

different  versions  of  inkscape  opened

this  is  the  older  version  of  inkscape

which  is

0.92.5  and  then  this  over  here  is  the

new  version  of  inkscape  which  is  version

1.0

and  as  you  can  see  i  have  the  same

object  posted  into  each

each  installation  if  you  notice  this  is

a  circle  its  a  green  circle  with  a

green  fill  and  a  red  stroke  as  you  can

see  here  in  the  data

the  fill  is  green  the  stroke  is  red  and

what  happens  is

in  the  older  version  of  inkscape  if  you

go  to  path

stroke  to  path  it  takes  that  red  stroke

and  turns  it  into  a  path  of  its  own  if

you  go  to  the  nodes  tool  youll  see

now  that  is  now  a  red  object  of  its  own

its  no  longer  a  stroke

so  let  me  just  undo  that  and  come  over

here  to  the  newer  version  of  inkscape  to

show  you  how  it  works  now

now  if  you  go  to  path  stroke  to  path

nothing  visual  nothing  visibly  changes

on  the  screen  but  what  it  did  was  it

took

this  it  took  the  red  stroke  and  turned

it  into  a  path  of  its  own

only  it  didnt  get  rid  of  the  green  fill

it  kept  the  green  fill  as  a  separate

object

grouped  together  with  the  red  stroke  and

to  see  what  i  mean  youll  have  to  go  to

object

ungroup  and  you  can  see  it  is  now  two

separate  objects  so  you  have  this  here

you  have  this  red  stroke  which  is  now

its  own  path  but  it  also

kept  this  green  fill  here  as  a  separate

object

so  let  me  undo  this  even  further  i  want

to  show  you  what  the  uh  the  work  around

is  now

lets  come  back  over  here  to  the

original  one  now  in  the  if  youre

following  along  with  one  of  these

tutorials  and  i  tell  you  to  do  stroke  to

path

break  apart  union  let  me  show  you  how

that  works  if  you  go  to  path

stroke  to  path  path  break  apart

path  union  you  end  up  with  this  right

here

this  this  sequence  doesnt  work  in  the

new  installation  of  inkscape  though  so

what  you  have  to  do  is  you  have  to

select  it

and  go  to  path  stroke  to  path

and  then  object  on  group

and  then  path  union  so  basically  what

youre  doing  is  were  taking  the

sequence

stroke  to  path  break  apart  union  and

replacing  it  with

stroke  to  path  on  group  union  ill  have

this  all  written

out  in  the  description  below  in  case  you

find  it  easier  to  follow  along  with  that

so

i  just  wanted  to  put  this  video  together

real  quick  to  address  that  problem

hopefully  this  isnt  too  much  of  a

disruption  to  your  learning  experience

if  you  have  any  questions  just  leave  a
