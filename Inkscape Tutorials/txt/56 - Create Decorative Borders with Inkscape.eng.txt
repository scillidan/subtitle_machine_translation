this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this  decorative  border

design

using  inkscape  before  we  get  started

though  if  youd  like  to  learn

everything  that  there  is  to  know  about

inkscape  be  sure  to  check  out  my

inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  ill  have  a  link  to  that  in

the  description  of  the  video  if  you  want

to  check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  we  have  to  do  is  set  up

our  documents  lets  come  over  here  to

file

and  click  on  document  properties  and  for

this  tutorial  i  want  to  make  sure  the

display  units  is  set  to  pixels  or  px

and  i  just  want  to  turn  off  the

visibility  of  the  page  border  right  here

where  it  says  show  page  border  and  then

close  out  of  that

and  then  we  want  to  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  view  make  sure  you  have

custom  selected

and  then  go  to  zoom  and  well  zoom  in  at

one  to  one

and  then  well  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  which  is  located  right  here

or  you  could  press

ctrl  shift  and  f  on  the  keyboard  to  open

that  and  then  well  open  up  the  align

and  distribute  menu  which  is  right  here

or  you  can  press  ctrl

shift  and  a  to  open  that  and  they  should

be  open  right  here

and  if  you  notice  they  opened  in  these

separate  menus  over  here  so  what  im

going  to  do  is  im  going  to  take  this

top  menu  and  just  click  and  drag  this

like  this  until  we  get  the  blue

activation  box

so  i  can  dock  that  up  top  and  i  have

this  one  open  so  we  have  them  both  open

at  the  same

time  like  that  and  then  finally  we  want

to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says  enable

snapping  make  sure  you  have  that  turned

on

and  the  settings  we  want  turned  on  for

this  tutorial  are  this  one  right  here

that  says  snap  nodes  pads  and  handles

the  next  one  that  says  snap  to  paths

were  going  to  want  to  snap

to  cusp  nodes  and  then  snap  to  smooth

nodes  as  well

okay  so  the  first  thing  were  going  to

do  is  uh  were  going  to  create  a  square

because  the  way  were  going  to  approach

this  border  design  is  that  were  going

to  design  the  corners  of  it  first

because  the  corners  are  pretty

complicated  as  well

as  as  soon  as  we  create  one  corner  we

should  be  able  to  duplicate  it  and

mirror  it  and  use  it  as  a  border  that

way  so

lets  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  over  here

and  im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  on

the  canvas  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

shift  to  create  a  perfectly  symmetrical

square  like  that

i  want  to  make  sure  that  is  black  i  want

to  make  sure  it  has  sharp  corners  come

up  here

to  where  it  says  this  this  icon  right

here  that  says  make  karn  make

corner  sharp  if  its  grayed  out  and  you

cant  click  on  it  that  means  you  already

have  sharp  corners  like  i  have  here  if

you  use  if  yours  has  rounded  corners

just  go  ahead  and  click  on  that  to

make  those  make  those  corners  sharp  now

what  im  going  to  do  is  grab  the  select

tool

and  i  want  to  change  the  size  of  this  to

50  pixels  by  50  pixels  so

im  going  to  come  up  here  between  the  w

and  the  h  which  is  the  width  and  the

height

im  going  to  turn  on  this  lock  icon

right  here  that  says  when  locked  change

both  the  width  and  the  height  by  the

same  proportions

and  i  want  to  change  the  width  of  this

to  50.  so  ill  hit  5.0  and  press  enter

and  i  want  to  take  the  opacity  of  this

and  bring  this  down  roughly  in  half

now  what  i  want  to  do  is  duplicate  this

so  lets  right  click  that  and  go  to

duplicate

lets  make  this  duplicate  copy  red  and

lets  add

50  pixels  to  each  dimension  of  this  one

so  50  plus  50  would  be  100  so  lets

remove  that  1  0  0  and  press  enter

and  now  i  want  to  lower  that  beneath  the

original  square  so  im  going  to  come  up

here  to  where  it  says

lower  selection  one  step  or  what  i  like

to  do  is  just  press  page  down

on  the  keyboard  and  itll  lower  it

beneath  the  black  square

and  then  i  want  to  click  and  drag  over

both  of  those  and  just  center  them  up

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis  like

that

and  as  i  mentioned  previously  you  got  to

make  sure  you  have  last  selected  chosen

from  this  drop  down  otherwise

you  may  end  up  with  a  different  result

here  okay  so  once  weve  done  that

lets  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  lets  create  another  copy  of

this  square  here  so  lets  click  on  the

red  square

lets  duplicate  that  instead  of  right

clicking  it  and  going  to  duplicate

well  just  press  ctrl  d  on  the  keyboard

and  ill  make  that  copy  black  and  i  will

add  another  50  pixels  to  this  one  so

this  one  would  be

150  like  that  and  then  i  will  lower  that

to  the  bottom

with  this  button  up  here  that  says  lower

selection  to  the  bottom  or  we  could

press  the  end

key  on  your  keyboard  lets  press  end

there  we  go

and  then  ill  center  this  up  as  well

click  and  drag  over  all  of  that  to

select  it

center  it  up  vertically  and  horizontally

like  that

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  create  a

rectangle  coming  down  here  like  an  arm

coming  extending  down  from  the  square  so

im  going  to  zoom  in  on  this  a little

bit  so  i  can  see  it  better  to  zoom  in

im  just  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  roll  up

the  mouse  wheel  a  few  times  to  move  the

page  around  like  this  just  press  down

the  mouse  wheel  and  move  the  mouse

and  lets  grab  the  rectangles  and

squares  tool  lets  snap  to  this  top  left

corner

click  and  drag  and  then  snap  to  this

bottom  corner  over  here  like  that

and  then  well  convert  that  to  a  path  by

going  to  path  object  to  path

and  then  lets  take  the  select  tool

lets  take  this  bottom  arrow  right  here

and  just  bring  this  down

like  that  we  want  to  bring  that  down  let

me  zoom  out  im  going  to  press  1  on  the

keyboard  to  zoom  back  out  to  100

and  once  weve  done  that  lets  create  a

duplicate  of  that  by  pressing  ctrl

d  and  lets  hold  shift  and  click  on  this

little

square  right  here  in  the  mental  in  the

middle  and  center  this  up

according  to  the  actually  no  instead  of

centering  it  were  going  to  align  the

left  edges  so  click  on  the  button  that

says  align  left  edges  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything

and  lets  create  another  copy  for  up

here  up  top  so  lets  take  this  copy

right  here

ctrl  d  to  duplicate  it  rotate  this  90

degrees  like  that

with  this  button  right  here  that  says

rotate  selection  90  degrees  clockwise

and  then  hold  shift  click  on  the  large

black  square  in  the  background  there

were  going  to  align  top  edges  and

align  left  edges  like  that  now  click  off

of  it  to

deselect  take  a  copy  of  this  right  here

click  on  that

control  d  hold  shift  click  on  the

smaller  black  square  in  the  middle  there

and  lets  align  the  top  edges  again  so

that  we  end  up  with  this  right  here  now

we  can  click  off  of  this  to  deselect

everything

so  what  im  going  to  do  next  is  im

going  to  take  this  large  black  square

right  here  im  going  to  duplicate  that

by  pressing  ctrl  d

i  want  to  make  this  one  red  and  again  we

are  going  to  add  50  to  50  pixels  to  each

dimension  so  lets  come  up  here  and

change  this  from  150

to  200  and  i  want  to  make  sure  i  have

this  centered  up  above  the  other  the

other  squares  here  so  let  me  move  this

off  to  the  side  im  going  to  hold  shift

click  on  one  of  these  squares  and  then

just  center  it  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  like  that

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

and  now  what  you  want  to  do  is  take  this

red  square  right  here

duplicate  it  by  pressing  ctrl  d  hold

shift  click  on  this  rectangle  right  here

and  go  to  path  difference

and  then  well  do  the  same  thing  over

here  for  this  one  take  this  red  square

only  this  time  were  not  going  to

duplicate  it  were  going  to  take  that  as

it  is

hold  shift  click  on  this  rectangle  right

here  path

difference  and  now  what  we  want  to  do  is

duplicate

this  object  by  pressing  ctrl  d

and  then  just  bring  this  one  down  here

like  that  now  well  take  this

little  leg  right  here  ctrl  d  to

duplicate  it  bring  this  one  up  here  like

that

and  now  i  want  to  make  it  so  that  these

two  i  want  to  clip  off  the

little  the  two  little  tails  that  are

extending  beyond  the  uh

border  there  so  to  do  that  let  me  zoom

in  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  roll  up  the

mouse  wheel

grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  which

is  the  second  tool  down  from  the  top  up

here

click  and  drag  over  these  two  nodes  and

then  hold  ctrl  and  just  click  and  drag

them  both  straight  up  like  that  until

they  snap  onto  the  edge  of  that

rectangle  well  do  the  same  thing  over

here  take  this  click  and  drag  over  those

two

hold  ctrl  click  and  drag  until  it  snaps

over  there  like  that

and  now  we  can  zoom  back  out  lets  go  to

the  select  tool

lets  click  and  drag  over  everything  so

we  have  it  all  selected

and  now  we  just  want  to  deselect  this

black  square  and  deselect  this  red

square  so  to  do  that  im  going  to  hold

shift

click  on  that  black  square  to  deselect

it  hold  shift  again

click  on  this  red  square  to  deselect

that  and  now  what  we  have  selected  we

just  want  to  unify  it

so  to  do  that  go  to  path  union

and  now  i  want  to  hold  shift  click  on

this  red  square

go  to  path  difference

now  if  we  press  one  on  the  keyboard  to

zoom  back  out  to  100

we  can  click  and  drag  over  everything

here  bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up

and  you  could  even  unify  together  by

going  to  path  union

and  now  we  have  a  corner  to  use  of  this

decorative  border  so  lets  go  ahead  and

create  an  actual  border  around  something

using  this  so

im  just  going  to  scale  this  down  a

little  bit  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

shift  and  scale  this  down

im  going  to  create  like  a  little

rectangle  on  the  canvas  here  so  im

going  to  grab  the  rectangle  tool

click  and  drag  to  create  a  rectangle

like  this

maybe  i  will  make  this  a  different  color

like  something  like  a  light  green

and  i  want  to  use  this  object  right  here

as  a  border  around  this  red  rectangle  so

let  me  grab  the  select  tool

let  me  take  this  corner  let  me  bring

this  over  here  its  layered  beneath

the  uh  the  green  rectangle  so  im  just

going  to  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

raise  selection  to  the  top

and  i  want  to  place  this  in  the  corner

up  here  like  that  okay  now  i  want  to

duplicate  this

ctrl  d  to  duplicate  it  bring  this  down

here  lets  flip  this

vertically  like  that  put  this  over  here

like  that  snap  that  into  this

and  lets  take  both  of  those  right  there

right  click

duplicate  now  lets  flip  these

horizontally

and  bring  these  over  here  like  this

okay  now  in  order  to  close  these  in  all

we  have  to  do  now  is  lets  click  off  of

that  to  deselect  everything

lets  grab  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

lets  click  on  this  border  right  here

and  im  going  to  take  these  nodes  over

here

ill  probably  i  should  probably  zoom  in

on  this  so  you can  see  it  better

click  and  drag  over  these  nodes  right

here  and  then  just  bring  them  over

to  this  object  right  here  like  that

well  do  the  same  thing  over  here  take

these  nodes  bring  them  straight  up  like

that

hold  ctrl  so  it  locks  onto  the  vertical

axis  you  can  either  snap  it  on  there

like  that

or  you  could  just  hold  ctrl  and  bring

them  into  so  that  it  protrudes  into  the

other  one

like  that  and  i  prefer  doing  it  that  way

because  if  you  dont  if  you  snap  them

like  that  youll  notice  if  you  zoom  out

theres  a  little  bit  of  a  disconnect

between  the  two  probably  difficult  to

see  it  on  my  screen  but

i  can  see  it  pretty  well  okay  so  let  me

fix  that

bring  that  up  further  and  ill  do  the

same  thing  right  here  ill  take  this

bring  this  in  over  here  hold  ctrl  bring

that  to  that  side

and  then  the  same  thing  right  here  take

that  bring  that  to  that  side  like  that

and  there  you  go  okay  and  using  that

method

you  can  use  that  method  to  apply  this

border  to

any  rectangle  youd  like  so  i  think  that

should  do  it  for  this  tutorial  that  is

how  you  can  go  about  creating  this

simple

decorative  style  border  using  inkscape
