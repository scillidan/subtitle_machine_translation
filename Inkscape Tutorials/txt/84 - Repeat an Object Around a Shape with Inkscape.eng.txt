this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  todays  tutorial  Ill  be

demonstrating  how  you  can  use  the

pattern  along  path  function  in  Inkscape

to  create  some  unique  and  interesting

designs  and  patterns  and  if  youd  like

to  learn  more  about  how  Inkscape  works

be  sure  to  check  out  the  Inkscape  master

class  which  is  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  that  I  created  where  I  go  over

all  of  the  different  tools  and  features

in  Inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are

and  demonstrate  how  they  work  we  even

have  a  private  community  where  I  could

personally  help  you  out  and  answer  any

questions  you  have  Ill  put  a  link  in

the  description  of  the  video  if  you  want

to  check  that  out  so  were  going  to  get

started  here  in  Inkscape  the  first  thing

we  want  to  do  is  just  make  sure  were

all  working  with  a  similar  page  setup  so

Im  going  to  go  to  view  make  sure  you

have  custom  selected  and  then  were  go

to  view  zoom  and  zoom  in  at  1  to  1  and

then  I  want  to  open  up  the  align  and

distribute  menu  with  this  button  up  here

were  gonna  want  last  selected  chosen

from  this  drop-down  and  then  Im  going

to  open  up  the  Edit  objects  colors

gradients  and  Stroke  menu  with  this

button  over  here  so  if  you  notice  here  I

have  this  shape  selected  and  what  Im

gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  use  the  pattern

along  path  function  in  Inkscape  to  take

this  stretch  to  take  this  shape  and

stretch  it  out  and  repeat  it  around  a

circle  now  you  dont  have  to  use  this

shape  you  can  use  whatever  shape  youd

like  you  could  use  a  circle  or  a  star

you  can  create  some  kind  of  custom  shape

and  shape  if  youd  like  but  what  Im

gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  grab  the  circles

and  ellipses  tool  and  Im  gonna  hold

ctrl  and  shift  and  Im  gonna  click  and

drag  in  the  campus  to  create  a  perfectly

round  circle  like  that  and  this  is  the

path  that  I  want  to  make  this  shape

follow  along  so  I  want  to  take  copies  of

this  shape  and  make  it  repeat  going  all

along  the  edges  of  this  circle  right

here  so  what  Im  gonna  do  first  is  Im

just  going  to  convert  this  to  a  path

Ill  get  a  path  object  to  path  and

thats  no  longer  a  a  circle  or  ellipse

object  its  now  recognized  as  a  regular

path  and  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

going  to  open  up  the  the  path  the  path

effects  menu  by  going  to  path  and

clicking  on  path  effects  and  what  Im

gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  click  plus  over

here  to  add  a  new  path  effect  to  this

circle  and  Im  gonna  look  for  pattern

along  path  it  should  be  about  halfway

through  the  list  here  pattern  along  path

click  Add

and  what  I  want  to  do  now  is  I  want  to

click  on  the  shape  that  Id  like  to

apply  around  the  circle  Im  gonna  grab

the  select  tool  Im  gonna  click  on  my

shape  right  here  like  I  said  you  can  use

any  shape  youd  like  you  dont  have  to

use  this  here  Im  gonna  right  click  this

and  go  to  copy  and  then  Im  gonna  click

on  this  circle  and  over  here  in  the

pattern  along  path  menu  Im  gonna  choose

where  it  says  pattern  copies  im  gonna

choose  repeated  stretched  and  im  gonna

click  on  this  button  over  here  that  says

link  path  on  clipboard  and  if  you  notice

it  took  this  object  and  repeated  it

around  the  edge  of  that  circle  right

here  and  now  this  this  circle  here  is

linked  to  this  original  shape  so  as  i

add  it  this  shape  this  will  edit  along

with  it  now  let  me  zoom  in  let  me  zoom

in  let  me  scale  this  down  a  little  bit

let  me  make  that  back  to  black  again  im

gonna  scale  this  down  and  youre  gonna

notice  it  scales  down  the  size  of  the

pattern  here  as  well  youll  notice  if  i

make  this  smaller  theres  now  more  of

these  shapes  in  here  because  the  smaller

size  means  more  of  these  shapes  can  fit

within  this  circle  now  it  works  the

other  way  as  well  if  i  make  that  larger

now  less  of  those  shapes  can  fit  within

that  circle  if  you  notice  here  start  you

get  starting  to  get  a  little  bit  of  a

little  bit  of  distortion  in  there  so  im

gonna  make  that  a  little  smaller  and

thats  how  the  repeated  stretch  let  me

click  on  that  again  repeated  stretch

thats  how  that  works

now  if  you  what  you  want  to  do  is  you

can  if  you  want  you  can  add  some  spacing

between  these  where  it  says  space  and

then  click  on  5  and  it  adds  5  units  of

spacing  between  each  object  right  there

if  you  notice  there  and  that  works  on

the  negative  as  well  if  i  add  negative  3

youll  notice  they  start  to  overlap  with

each  other  each  of  those  objects  now  let

me  put  that  back  to  zero  another  thing

you  can  do  is  nope  there  we  go  another

thing  you  could  do  is  you  can  use  single

stretched  and  if  you  choose  single

stretch  what  its  going  to  do  is  its

gonna  take  this  object  and  its  gonna

stretch  it  out  all  the  way  you  learn  all

the  way  around  the  perimeter  of  this

path  here  now  if  you  know  you  probably

its  probably  hard  to  tell  what  that  is

but  you  can  if  you  if  you  really  look

closely  you  can  see  it  took  this  object

and  stretched  it  out  like  that  so  let  me

undo  that  let  me  put  this  back  at

repeated  stretched  and  what

youre  done  once  youre  happy  with  how

this  looks  what  youre  wanting  what  you

want  to  do  is  you  want  to  finalize  it

before  you  finalize  it  if  you  want  you

can  remove  the  path  and  you  itll  put  it

back  to  a  circle  let  me  undo  that

or  you  can  finalize  it  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  and  now  thats  no  longer

a  pattern  along  path  object  now  this

doesnt  just  work  with  circles  you  can

do  this  with  virtually  any  shape  and

Ill  show  you  what  I  mean  let  me  scale

that  down  put  that  out  of  the  way  Im

gonna  grab  the  Bezier  pen  over  here  and

Im  gonna  click  to  create  a  point  Im

gonna  hold  ctrl  bring  the  line  across

the  screen  like  this  and  then  click  to

create  another  point  and  then  press

ENTER  on  the  keyboard  and  Im  gonna  grab

the  Edit  path  by  nodes  tool  and  Im

gonna  edit  this  line  a  little  bit  give

it  a  little  bit  of  a  curve  that  right

there  is  what  Im  looking  for  or

something  like  that  and  now  Im  gonna

again  and  once  again  Im  going  to  copy

this  right  click  copy  Im  gonna  click  on

this  path  Im  gonna  add  Im  gonna  come

back  up  here  to  the  path  effects  menu

click  the  plus  to  add  a  path  effect

pattern  a  long  path  we  want  to  use

repeated  stretched  and  Im  gonna  go

ahead  and  click  link  and  if  you  notice

here  took  the  object  and  it  stretched  it

a  lot  and  it  repeated  that  along  that

path  but  it  took  on  the  properties  of

the  line  that  we  drew  where  it  had  a

one-point  stroke  in  no  fill  color  so  Im

gonna  give  that  a  fill  color  and  Im

gonna  get  rid  of  the  outline  otherwise

known  as  the  stroke  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  on  the  X  right  there  and  that

right  there  it  took  this  pattern  and  it

applied  it  along  this  path  here  now

another  thing  you  can  do  with  this  is

you  can  use  this  to  create  like  kind  of

like  a  wreath  let  me  show  you  what  I

mean  here  Im  gonna  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  Im  gonna  hold  ctrl  and

shift  to  create  a  circle  like  that  let

me  bring  the  opacity  down  a  little  bit

grab  the  Select  tool  duplicate  that  by

hitting  ctrl  D  and  hold  ctrl  move  this

over  to  the  right  click  and  drag  over

both  of  those  and  go  to  path

intersection  and  this  shape  right  here

is  what  were  looking  for  Im  gonna

right  click  that  and  go  to  copy  and  now

Im  going  to  create  another  circle  Im

going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  click  and

drag  click  and  drag  to  create  a  circle

convert  that  to  a  path  by  going  to  path

object  to  path

and  now  I  will  add  a  path  effect  to  this

again  once  again  pattern  along  path  Im

gonna  choose  repeated  stretched  and  Im

going  to  go  ahead  and  link  it  and  if  you

notice  here  its  taking  this  object  and

linking  it  its  its  repeating  it  around

the  outside  of  that  circle  so  let  me

grab  the  Select  tool  I  want  to  click  on

this  object  click  on  it  again  to  get  the

rotation  handles  Im  just  gonna  hold

ctrl  and  rotate  this  to  the  right  a

couple  of  times  like  that  and  if  you

notice  here  on  the  left  side  were

starting  to  get  what  appears  to  be  kind

of  like  this  this  could  be  kind  of  like

a  reef  like  a  of  a  wreath  of  leaves  let

me  scale  this  down  to  show  you  Im  gonna

add  some  spacing  in  there  let  me  click

on  the  on  the  on  the  path  effect  here

Im  gonna  add  some  spacing  in  there

woops  messed  something  up  there  there  we

go  lets  add  to  see  how  that  looks  maybe

a  little  less  than  that  maybe  a  little

more  let  me  rotate  this  around  a  little

bit  and  as  you  rotate  it  it  changes  the

position  as  you  can  see  there  now  I  like

how  that  looks  right  there  Im  gonna

finalize  that  by  clicking  on  it  and

going  to  path  object  to  path  and  Im

going  to  create  another  circle  inside  of

there  let  me  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  hold  ctrl  and  shift  click

and  drag  to  create  a  slightly  smaller

circle  than  this  one  Center  it  up  inside

of  here  click  and  drag  over  both  of

those  and  Center  them  up  on  the  center

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis  path

object  to  path  and  now  Ill  click  on

this  I  want  these  leaves  to  go  the

opposite  way  the  opposite  direction  of

these  so  Im  just  gonna  flip  this  one

horizontally  Ill  click  on  this  button

up  here  that  says  flip  selected  objects

horizontally  right  click  that  go  to  copy

click  on  this  path  and  make  that  a

little  bit  bigger  and  once  again  I  will

add  a  path  effect  same  way  as  I  did  with

the  other  objects  repeated  stretched

link  it  and  two  point  spacing  like  we

did  before  we  make  that  a  little  bigger

I  think  I  used  less  spacing  than  that

let  me  bring  that  down  a  little  bit

okay  that  looks  pretty  good  right  about

there  and  I  will  go  I  will  finalize  that

by  going  to  path  object  to  path  and  now

what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  break

this  apart  so  what  this  is  all

individual  pieces  Ill  go  to  path  break

apart  and  let  me  get  rid  of  some  of

these  extras  in  here  I  want  to  just  keep

the  left  side  here  so  let  me  get  rid  of

these  press  Delete  on  the  keyboard  to

get  rid  of  them  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  over  here  path  break  apart  let  me

get  rid  of  these  extras  over  here  like  I

said  Im  just  keeping  the  left  hand  side

for  now  and  as  you  can  see  here  we  have

like  the  left-hand  side  of  kind  of  like

a  little  accent  piece  or  a  wreath  like

that  let  me  bring  the  opacity  to  this  up

let  me  group  it  together  by  clicking  the

group  selected  objects  button  and  now  I

can  duplicate  that  by  hitting  ctrl  D

hold  ctrl  click  and  drag  this  off  to  the

right  flip  this  horizontally  and  there

you  go  now  you  can  put  some  kind  of

design  in  the  middle  here  you  can  create

some  kind  of  like  little  law  maybe  like

an  award  graphic  or  some  kind  of  logo

with  these  sorts  of  decorations  on  it

but  I  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

video  that  take  and  go  about  using  the

pattern  along  path  effects  with  Inkscape

if  you  have  any  questions  let  me  know

and  as  always  thanks  for  watching
