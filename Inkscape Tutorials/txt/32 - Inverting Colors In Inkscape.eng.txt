lets  go  over  how  you  can  invert  the

colors  of  an  object  using  inkscape  on  my

screen  here  I  have  this  example  design

that  I  downloaded  that  consists  of  a

grouping  of  vector  objects  for  this

demonstration  Im  going  to  create  a

duplicate  of  this  design  here  by

pressing  Ctrl  D  and  Im  going  to  move

this  over  to  the  right  here  just  so  I

have  something  to  compare  the  end  result

to

so  when  you  invert  the  colors  of  objects

what  happens  is  youre  taking  a  color

and  swapping  it  out  with  the  color  that

opposes  it  on  the  color  wheel

so  every  instance  of  blue  will  become

orange  orange  will  become  blue  yellow

will  become  purple  so  on  and  so  forth

so  to  accomplish  this  in  inkscape  the

first  thing  youll  want  to  do  is  select

your  object  or  objects  you  can  use

multiple  objects  if  youd  like  and  with

them  selected  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  filters

go  to  color  and  select  invert

and  once  you  do  that  you  will  get  this

invert  menu  with  some  settings  that  you

can  apply

so  the  first  thing  well  want  to  do  is

turn  on  the  live  preview  so  we  can  see

the  changes  as  theyre  happening  and  if

you  look  just  above  that  youll  see

these  three  options  right  here  the  first

one  is  invert  Hue  if  I  select  that  and

inverts  all  of  the  colors  as  you  can  see

there  but  if  you  notice  the  eyes  which

are  white  or  lighter  in  color  they  dont

change  they  remain  a  light  shade  this  is

because  we  dont  have  invert  lightness

selected  so  if  I  if  I  select  invert

lightness

it  inverts  the  lighter  tones  as  well  so

that  you  get  more  of  this  photo  negative

effect  and  then  finally  down  here  what

invert  transparency  does  is  you  wont

see  it  on  this  example  but  if  youre

working  with  the  graphic  that  has  areas

of  partial  transparency  itll  just

invert  that  so  for  example  if  its  80

opaque  itll  become  20  opaque

so  let  me  undo  this

let  me  undo  the  invert  lightness  because

I  think  for  this  demonstration  it  looks

better  like  that  and  if  you  come  up  here

we  have  this  light  transparency  slider

which  allows  you  to  add  lightness  to  the

design  if  necessary

this  can  be  useful  sometimes  because

when  you  invert  colors  sometimes  you  get

really  dark  results  this  can  help  you

lighten  things  up  a  bit  this  example

looks  good  with  it  not  applied  so  Im

going  to  keep  it  down  to  zero  and  then

finally  up  here  you  can  choose  to  invert

colors  by  the  channels  so  by  default  we

have  no  inversion  but  if  I  invert  by  the

red  and  blue  Channel

you  get  this  effect  right  here  and  if  I

toggle  the  hue

you  can  see  we  end  up  with  that  effect

right  there

so  lets  try  and  invert  by  the  red  and

green  channels  now  we  get  something  like

that

and  without  the  Hue  applied

it  looks  like  that

and  then  finally  we  have  green  and  blue

that  looks  like  that  and  without  the  Hue

you  end  up  with  something  like  that

right  there  so  thats  something  you

could  play  around  with  we  can  get  all  of

these  different  results  here  just  like

that  so  I  liked  my  results  best  with  no

inversion  like  that  and  Im  going  to

click  apply

and  then  I  click  close

and  there  you  go  that  is  how  you  can

invert  the  colors  of  an  object  using

inkscape  now  one  last  thing  Id  like  to

point  out  before  I  end  this  video  is

that  when  you  apply  this  filter  youre

not  actually  changing  the  colors  of  the

objects  youre  just  changing  the  color

of  their  appearance  on  your  screen  now

if  I  click  on  this  object  right  here

this  right  here  is  the  inverted  copy  and

this  over  here  is  the  original  copy  with

this  object  selected  you  can  see  here

this  is  a  light  shade  of  lavender  but  if

you  look  down  here  in  the  color  status

bar  its  still  its  original  color  as  you

can  see  over  here  thats  how  its

registering  because  this  is  just  a

temporary  filter  thats  applied  to  the

object

now  if  youre  going  to  be  taking  your

design  and  exporting  it  as  a  JPEG  or  a

PNG  then  you  can  ignore  this  part  of  the

video  because  this  doesnt  really  apply

here  but  if  youre  going  to  take  the  SVG

file  and  try  to  open  it  in  another

application  such  as  qriket  design  space

or  illustrator  this  effect  is  not  going

to  carry  over  because  this  is  an

inkscape  specific  effect  youre  going  to

end  up  with  this  right  here

so  if  you  truly  want  your  colors  to  be

inverted  what  youll  want  to  do  is  take

an  original  copy  and  swap  out  and  change

the  colors  manually  one  by  one  so  if  I

select  this  object  I  can  come  over  here

to  my  dropper  tool  and  select  that  area

and  now  it  is  the  desired  color  as  you

can  see  there

so  Ill  do  the  same  thing  Im  going  to

click  on  the  nose  now  and  do  the  same

thing  Im  just  going  to  use  the  keyboard

shortcuts  to  toggle  between  the  tools

for  the  dropper  the  keyboard  shortcut  is

d

and  Ill  click  on  that  and  then  Ill

switch  back  to  the  selection  tool  which

is  s  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  over

here  switch  back  and  forth  between  D  and

S

and  you  could  just  go  through  here  one

by  one  and  change  all  of  these  colors

like  that

and  there  you  go  now  we  have  a  copy  that

has  colors  that  are  truly  inverted  and

then  we  have  this  filtered  copy  over

here  now  if  you  want  to  remove  the

filter  at  any  time  you  could  just  select

the  objects  and  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  filters  and  go  down  to  where  it

says  remove  filters  and  now  its  back  to

how  it  was  previously

so  thats  how  you  can  work  with  color

inversion  in  inkscape  if  you  found  this

lesson  useful  then  consider  checking  out

my  inkscape  master  class  its  a

collection  of  over  60  videos  where  I  go

over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  kind  of  like

how  I  did  in  this  video  we  even  have  a

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  want  and  best  of  all  theres  no

monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay  17

one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching
