this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  these  flat  style  vector

avatars

using  inkscape  and  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape  and  i  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works

ill  put  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  well  get  started  here  in  escape  the

first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  just  set  up

our  documents  that  were  all  working

with  a  similar  view

i  just  want  to  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  view  make  sure  we  have  custom

selected

well  come  over  here  to  zoom  make  sure

you  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

and  then  im  going  to  open  up  the  align

and  distribute  menu  with  this  button

over  here  or  you  could  just  press

ctrl  shift  and  a  as  you  can  see  here

where  it  says  relative  to  were  going  to

want  to  have  this  set  to  last  selected

and  then  ill  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  which  is  over  here  or  you

can  just  press  ctrl

shift  and  f  and  well  have  that  open  as

you  can  see  there

so  to  get  us  started  basically  what

were  going  to  be  doing  is  were  just

going  to  be  using  really  basic  common

shapes  in  inkscape  to  put  together

avatars  or  faces  and

ill  just  do  one  as  an  example  here  im

going  to  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  right  here

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  to

create  a  rectangle  like  that  a  little

longer  in  height  a  little  larger  in

height  than  it  is  in  width

because  this  is  going  to  represent  our

avatars  head  and  up  here  this  little

note  at  the  top  right  this  little

circular  note  im  just  going  to  bring

that  down  like  that  to  give  this  rounded

corners

and  ill  give  this  a  color  just  to  color

in  the  face  here  maybe  like  a  shade  of

orange  or  something  like  that

over  here  in  the  fill  tab  under  the  hsl

tab  im  just  going  to  adjust  the  color  a

little  bit  maybe

give  it  a little  more  vibrance  like  that

there  we  go  that  looks  pretty  good  and

now  that  represents  thats  going  to

represent  the  head  im  going  to  put  some

eyes  on  here  now  so  let  me  grab  the

circle  tool  and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl

and  shift  so  that  it  makes  a

perfectly  round  circle  like  that  and

just  click  and  drag  there  we  go

ill  make  the  eyes  black  or  a  dark  shade

of  gray  like  that

put  this  towards  the  center  like  that

create  another  eye  so  im  going  to  right

click  this  and  go  to  duplicate

and  hold  ctrl  and  move  this  over  here

like  that  now  im  going  to  create

another  rectangle  right  in  the  center

here  which  is  going  to  represent  the

nose  so  let  me  grab  the

the  rectangle  tool  again  make  the  nose

put  that  right  there

i  want  to  make  this  the  same  shade  as

the  uh  the  head  here  but

slightly  darker  so  im  going  to  grab  the

dropper  tool  which  is  over  here

i  just  like  to  press  d  on  the  keyboard

to  grab  that  its  a  lot  more  convenient

click  on  that  to  give  it  that  color  and

im  just  going  to  make  this  a  little

darker  like  that

looking  pretty  good  now  im  going  to

grab  the  select  tool  i  want  to  make  sure

this  is  all  centered  up  on  the  page  here

so  im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on

the  head  right  there  and  im  going  to

make  sure  the  nose  is  centered

on  the  head  and  im  going  to  take  these

two  circles  the  eyes  hold

shift  click  them  both  group  them

together  with  this  button  up  here  that

says  group  selected  objects

then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the  head

and  then  center  that  up

on  the  uh  horizontal  axis  like  that  or

the  vertical  axis  rather

now  let  me  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  im  going  to  click  over  those

objects  right  there

so  i  select  them  both  and  just  hold  ctrl

and  scale  them  up  a  little  bit

you  may  have  to  scale  them  up  or  down

depending  on  how  big  or

small  you  made  them  so  just  go  ahead  and

manually  adjust  it  as  you  see  fit

and  what  ill  do  now  is  ill  just  put

like  a  little  bit  of  a  little  mouth  down

here  so  im

going  to  grab  the  circles  and  ellipses

tool  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  click  and

drag  to  create  a  perfectly  round  circle

like  that

and  i  only  want  half  of  that  circle  so

what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going to

convert  this  to  a  path  ill  go  to  path

object  to  path  im  going  to  grab  the

bezier  pen  which  is

im  just  going  to  press  b  on  the

keyboard  to  grab  that  its  this  is  its

this  icon  right  here  i  dont  normally

use  these  tools  so

i  just  have  the  keyboard  shortcuts

memorized  and  then  i  want  to  turn  on

snapping  up  here  i  want  to  make  sure  i

have  snapping  enabled  and  i  want  to  have

this  one  right  here  enabled  that  says

snap  to  cusp  nodes  including  rectangle

corners

and  this  one  right  here  snap  to  smooth

nodes  including  quadrant  points  of

ellipses  i  want  to  make  sure  those  two

are  enabled

im  going  to  snap  to  the  left  side  of

this  circle  click

snap  to  the  right  side  of  that  circle

click  and  then  finish  the  shape  up

around  the  outside  like  that

grab  the  select  tool  hold  shift  click  on

the  circle  so  we  have  them  both  selected

and  go  to  path

difference  and  what  i  want  to  do  now  is

i  want  to  make  this

a  shade  of  red  like  that  this  is  going

to  represent  the  mouth  i  want  to  put  a

rectangle  up  top  here  to  represent  teeth

let  me  first  put  this  over  here  im

going  to  hold  ctrl  and  scale  that  down  a

little  bit

let  me  hold  shift  and  click  on  both  of

those  objects  and  make  sure  i  have  them

centered  up  like  that

i  might  want  to  take  these  eyes  and  nose

and  move  them  up  a  little  bit

im  going  to  put  another  rectangle  right

here  to  represent  teeth

so  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to  i  want

to  make  sure  that  the  rectangle  is  the

same  width

as  this  half  circle  so  im  going  to

click  on  the  half  circle  up  here  where

it  says  width

im  going  to  triple  click  that  so  we

have  it  all  selected  and  im  going  to

copy  whatever  that  number  is  im  going

to  hit  ctrl  c

on  the  keyboard  and  now  im  going  to

create  a  rectangle  so  im  going  to  come

over  here

create  a  rectangle  like  that  were  going

to  want  square  corners  in  this  rectangle

so  im  going  to  click  this  button  up

here

to  make  sure  the  corner  is  sharp  like

that

and  now  im  going  to  paste  the  height  in

there  so  ill  grab  the  select  tool  and

again  where  it  says  width

triple  click  that  and  then  just  hit  ctrl

v  to  paste  the  height  in  there  like  that

thats  what  im  looking  for  im  going  to

make  that  white

to  represent  teeth  maybe  make  that  a

little  smaller

im  going  to  hold  shift  click  on  the

mouth  group  those  two  together

with  the  group  button  up  here  oops

there  we  go  let  me  make  that  a  little

smaller  again  make  sure  we  have  it

centered  up  it  looks  like  it  already  is

and  what  im  going to  do  now  is  im

going  to  add  some  ears  to  the  sides  of

the  head  here

now  if  you  see  me  scrolling  um  you  see

me  zooming  in  and  out  like  this  you

could  just  hold  ctrl

and  roll  up  and  down  your  mouse  wheel  to

zoom  in  and  out  and  to  move  around  the

page  you  can  just  press  down  the  mouse

wheel  and  move  around  the  mouse

so  let  me  grab  the  circles  and  ellipses

tool  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  to

create  another  ellipse  or  a  circle

rather  like  this

i  want  to  make  this  the  same  color  as

the  skin  tone  here  so  im  going  to  grab

the  dropper  tool

over  here  and  make  that  the  same  color

now  i  want  this  to  be  positioned  beneath

the  head  so  im  going  to  come  up  here  to

where  it  says

lower  selection  to  the  bottom  and  click

on  that  and  let  me  just  turn  off

snapping  for  the  time  being  because  that

may  get  in  the  way  of  where  i  want  to

position

the  uh  the  ears  here  so  let  me  bring

this  over  like  that

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and

scale  that  down  it  looks  a  little  too

a  little  too  big  position  that  right

about  there

now  im  going  to  create  a  a  duplicate  of

this  circle  by  pressing  control  d

and  im  going  to  make  it  the  same  color

as  the  nose  right  here  so  again  were

going  to  grab  the  dropper

go  like  that  there  we  go  now  im  going

to  lower  this  down  im  going  to  lower

this  one  step

lower  this  another  step  so  that  it  goes

beneath  the  head  there

and  to  do  that  im  pushing  this  button

right  here  lower  selection  one  step

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  scale

that  down

and  that  right  there  is  what  im  looking

for  so  ill  hold  shift  now

and  click  on  both  of  these  circles  so  i

have  them  both  selected  and  ill  group

them  together

group  selected  objects  and  now  i  want  to

duplicate  them  because  im  going  to

use  them  for  the  other  ear  over  here  so

instead  of  right  clicking  and  going  to

duplicate  im  just  going  to  press  ctrl

d  on  the  keyboard  to  duplicate  it  and

then  ill  hold  ctrl  and  just  click  and

drag  this  over  to  the  right  side  like

that

and  im  going  to  lower  them  to  the

bottom  maybe  ill  move  this  over  a

little  closer  like  that

i  want  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

other  ear  over  here  i  want  both  sets  of

ears  selected

and  i  want  to  group  them  together  and

then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the  head

and  center  that  up  on  the  vertical  axis

like  that  now  let  me  zoom  out  a  little

bit  so  i  can  see  how  this  is  coming  out

its  looking  pretty  good  one  thing  i

want  to  do  is  make  the  head  a  little

more  elongated  so  let  me  convert

this  to  a  path  im  going to  go  to  path

object  to  path

and  now  im  going  to  go  to  the  edit

paths  by  nodes  tool  im  going  to  click

and  drag  over  this  top  portion  of  nodes

over  here

and  just  hold  ctrl  and  move  them  up  like

there  because  were  going  to  put  some

hair

over  the  head  here  and  i  want  to  make

sure  i  have  more  room  to  work  with

so  let  me  grab  this  select  tool  what  im

going  to  do  now  is  im  going  to  create

some  hair  for  our  avatar  here  so

to  do  this  im  going  to  create  an  offset

of  the  head  here  so  im  going  to  go  to

with  this

head  selected  ill  go  to  path  linked

offset

and  thats  going  to  create  a  copy  of  it

and  the  copy  is  going  to  be  located

behind

the  head  so  let  me  just  come  over  here

and  pick  a  color  for  the  hair  im  going

to  go  with

like  this  shade  of  brown  over  here

youre  not  going  to  see  it  change  colors

on  your  screen  because  its  positioned

behind  the  head  but  once  youve  done

that  you  can  take  this  little  node  and

pull  that  out

and  youll  notice  its  coming  out  like

that  now  let  me  finalize  that  by

converting  it  to  a  path  well  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  i  want  to  grab  the

select  tool

and  lower  this  to  the  bottom  so  it  goes

beneath  the  ears  and  now  i  just  want  to

cut  off

the  portion  of  the  hair  that  is  below

the  ears  so  let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen

again

im  going  to  start  right  about  here

click  to  create  a  point  hold  ctrl  bring

the  line  straight  through  like  that

create  another  point  now  we  can  just  let

go  of  control  and  finish  the  shape

around  the  outside  like  that

grab  the  select  tool  hold  shift  click  on

the  object  there  and  go  to

path  difference  and  there  we  go  now  we

have

the  sides  of  the  hair  anyway  im  going

to  add  some  hair  to  the  top  up  here

so  to  do  that  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool  again  and  im  just  going

to  create  a  rectangle  over  the  top  here

to  create  some  hair  to  put  on  top  of  the

head

ill  position  this  right  about  here  and

im  going  to  make  this  shade  a  little

lighter

just  to  add  a  little  bit  of  depth  to  the

design  here  and  what  i  want  to  do  now  is

i  want  to  leave  this  corner

sharp  but  i  want  to  make  these  three

corners  rounded  and  to  do  that  im  going

to  use  a

live  path  effect  called  fillet  and

chamfer

so  let  me  first  convert  this  to  a  path

ill  go  to  path

object  to  path  now  i  want  to  open  up  the

path  effects  menu  so  ill  go  to  path

grab  the  path  effects  menu  and  right

here  where  it  says  plus

click  on  plus  to  add  a  new  path  effect

and  the  one  im  looking  for  is  corners

or  the  fillet  and  chamfer  path  effect

click  on  that

and  down  here  where  it  says  change  only

selected  nodes  make  sure  you  click  on

that  to  have  that  box  text

and  im  going  to  grab  the  edit  pads  by

nodes  tool

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

this  node  on  the  top  left  then  hold

shift  click  on  this  click  and  drag  over

that  node  on  the  bottom  left

and  then  again  hold  shift  and  take  this

node  over  here  on  the  bottom  right

so  that  we  only  have  these  three  nodes

selected  because  i  want  to  make  these

three  corners  rounded

now  where  it  says  radius  im  just  going

to  click  this  little  plus  icon  and

youre  going  to  notice

it  rounds  the  corners  it  rounds  those

corners  as  we  do  that  while  leaving  this

corner  sharp

that  right  there  is  what  im  looking  for

so  let  me  let  me  finalize  that  by  going

to  path

object  to  path  i  can  now  close  out  of

the  path  effects  menu  we  dont  need  that

anymore

place  that  right  about  there  this  is

starting  to  come  together  now

one  final  thing  i  want  to  do  is  just  add

a  little  bit  of  a  a  little  bit  of  an

accent  piece  right  here  to  make  it  look

like  um  like  light  is  reflecting  off  the

hair  so  im  going  to  take  this

object  im  going  to  duplicate  it  by

pressing  ctrl  d

and  then  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  this  one  of  these  lighter

shades  down  here  for  the  for  the  color

we  originally  used  for  the  hair

to  give  that  an  outline  otherwise  known

as  a  stroke  now  let  me  remove

the  fill  color  from  this  object  im

going  to  click  this  little  red  x  over

here  to  the  bottom  left

and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and

scale  this  down  a little  bit  like  that  i

just  want  to  position  this  right  about

here

i  just  want  to  take  a  sample  of  this

line  right  here  i  dont  want  the

entirety  of  this  line

if  you  want  to  come  over  if  you  want  you

can  come  over  here  to  the  stroke  style

tab  to  adjust  the  thickness  of  this  line

yours

the  thickness  of  your  line  may  vary

depending  on  what  you  most  recently  used

so

im  going  to  make  this  a  little  thicker

and  now  i  just  like  i  said  i  just  want

to  grab  a  sample  of  this  line  i  dont

want  the  entire  line  so  im  going  to

grab  the  bezier  pen  click  to  create  a

point  hold  ctrl  bring  this  straight

through

like  that  then  bring  this  straight

through  like  that

back  to  the  starting  point  grab  the

select  tool

hold  shift  click  on  the  object  and  go  to

path

cut  path  and  thats  going  to  slice  that

into  two  individual  pieces  so  let  me

click  off  of  that

and  take  just  this  object  and  just  get

rid  of  that  by  pressing  delete  on  the

keyboard

and  now  we  have  this  im  going  to  go

come  over  here  to  where  it says  stroke

paint  and  im  going  to  adjust  the  color

of  that  a  little  bit

make  that  little  there  we  go  just  a

little  lighter  than  the  hair  over  here

so  if  we  zoom  out  you  can  see  were

pretty  much  done  we  have  created  our
