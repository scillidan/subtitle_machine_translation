although  inkscape  is  meant  to  be  a

vector  design  app  that  doesnt  mean  it

cant  be  used  to  edit  photos  as  well

in  fact  id  even  go  as  far  as  saying

that  inkscape  can  handle  certain  photo

editing  tasks  better  than  some

pixel-based  editors

one  example  of  such  would  be  when

applying  color  overlays  to  your

photographs  which  well  be  demonstrating

in  todays  tutorial



before  we  get  started  with  the  lesson

id  just  like  to  take  a  moment  to  give  a

special  thank  you  to  expressvpn  for

sponsoring  todays  video

so  to  get  us  started  here  im  first

going  to  show  you  how  to  do  this

manually  using  a  single  color  with  blend

modes  and  then  ill  show  you  how  to  do

this  using  the  duo  chrome  filter  in

inkscape

so  the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  here  is

import  my  image  onto  the  canvas  now

theres  various  different  ways  to  do

this  but  my  preferred  way  of  importing

images  is  to  just  click  and  drag  the

image  file  onto  the  canvas  let  me  show

you  what  i  mean  here  if  i  bring  in  my

folder  with  my  image  all  i  have  to  do  is

just  click  and  drag  this  onto  the  canvas

like  that  and  then  i  will  get  this

little  prompt  right  here  that  asks  me  if

i  want  to  embed  or  link  it  im  going  to

choose  to  embed  the  image  and  click  ok

and  there  you  go  as  you  can  see  the

image  has  been  embedded

so  let  me  zoom  out  now  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  roll  down  my  mouse  wheel  to

zoom  out  a  little  bit  so  i  have  a  better

look  at  this  and  to  move  my  page  around

im  just  pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel

and  moving  the  mouse

now  what  i  want  to  do  is  resize  the

document  to  be  the  same  size  as  this

image  right  here  so  with  this  image

selected  press  ctrl  shift  and  r  on  the

keyboard  and  it  will  change  the  document

to  be  resized  around  this  image  okay  so

now  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to

create  a  rectangle  and  make  it  the  same

size  as  this  image  so  let  me  right  click

this  image  and  go  to  copy

let  me  grab  the  rectangle  tool  over  here

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  on  my

canvas  to  create  a  rectangle  it  doesnt

need  to  be  the  same  size  as  the  image  it

just  needs  to  be  any  size  were  going  to

address  that  right  now  we  just  go  to

edit  go  to  paste  size  and  select  paste

size  and  its  going  to  take  the  image

size  that  i  have  copied  to  my  clipboard

and  apply  it  to  that  rectangle  now  im

going  to  grab  the  selection  tool  and  im

going  to  change  the  color  of  this

rectangle  to  whatever  color  id  like  my

overlay  to  be  so  for  this  example  i  will

use  a  blue  shade  so  ill  come  down  here

to  my  palette  and  i  will  choose  a  shade

of  blue  like  that

and  now  i  want  to  center  this  up  over

the  image  so  let  me  hold  shift  and  click

on  the  image  so  i  have  both  the

rectangle  and  the  image  selected  and  i

will  open  up  the  align  the  distribute

menu  which  is  located  over  here  you  can

also  access  that  by  pressing  ctrl  shift

and  a  on  your  keyboard

within  the  align  the  distribute  menu  i

want  to  make  sure  that  i  have  the

relative  two  set  to  last  selected  and

then  once  thats  enabled  we  can  center

it  vertically  and  horizontally  like  that

and  as  you  as  you  can  see  the  rectangle

should  be  directly  over  the  image  now

so  let  me  click  off  of  the  graphic  to

deselect  everything  im  going  to  select

just  this  rectangle  right  here  and  now

im  going  to  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  which  is  located  up  here  or  you  can

access  it  by  pressing  ctrl  shift  and  f

on  the  keyboard



once  we  are  in  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

if  you  look  down  here  to  the  bottom

right  of  the  menu  you  will  see  this  drop

down  menu  for  blend  modes  by  default  the

blend  mode  is  set  to  normal  meaning  this

rectangle  looks  like  a  normal  rectangle

with  a  solid  fill

we  can  change  the  way  that  this  object

interacts  with  objects  positioned

beneath  it  though  by  changing  this  blend

mode  let  me  show  you  what  i  mean  here

im  going  to  change  this  to  multiply

and  as  you  can  see  it  changes  the

appearance  of  the  image  or  the  way  that

the  rectangle  interacts  with  the  image

beneath  it  and  if  i  use  my  arrow  keys  i

can  cycle  through  all  of  the  different

blend  modes  we  have  here  until  i  find

the  color  overlay  that  i  prefer

now  this  one  right  here  seems  to  work

pretty  well  the  effect  im  looking  for

is  just  a  simple  color  overlay  and  what

this  one  does  the  color  blend  mode  it

just  takes  the  color  and  applies  it  over

the  image  nicely  like  that  without

making  too  many  other  changes  i  should

mention  though  that  every  single  image

is  different  so  if  youre  working  with

the  image  a  different  image  than  this

you  may  want  to  cycle  through  these

blend  modes  to  see  which  one  works  best

now  as  you  can  see  here  if  i  take  this

object  and  move  it  off  of  the  image  over

there  you  can  see  it  looks  the  same  as

it  did  before  the  only  difference  is  the

way  it  interacts  with  the  objects

beneath  it  like  that  and  if  you  dont

like  how  this  works  and  you  want  to  go

back  to  having  a  regular  solid  fill

rectangle  at  any  point  you  could  just

select  it  and  set  the  blend  mode  back  to

normal  like  that  and  as  you  can  see  its

now  a  regular  rectangle  again

so  now  lets  have  a  look  at  an  arguably

easier  and  maybe  even  better  way  to  do

this  using  the  duochrome  filter  and

inkscape

so  what  im  going to  do  is  im  going  to

select  my  image  right  here  and  im  going

to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says  filters

im  looking  for  color  and  then  i  will

choose  duochrome

and  once  youve  done  that  youre  going

to  get  this  little  menu  right  here

the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  with  this

menu  is  where  it  says  live  preview  i

want  to  enable  that  checkbox  right  there

and  as  you  can  see  when  i  enabled  that

it  applied  two  different  colors  to  my

image  it  applied  the  color  blue  to  the

darker  shades  and  it  applied  the  color

green  to  the  lighter  shades  and  the

reason  why  is  because  color  one  up  here

in  this  tab  is  set  to  blue  and  color  two

up  here  in  this  tab  is  set  to  green  now

if  you  want  to  change  your  colors  you

could  do  so  very  easily  up  here  say  for

example  i  want  to  change  the  darker

shades  from  blue  to  something  else  like

pink  i  can  do  that  as  well  if  i  want  to

i  can  change  this  like  that

and  there  we  go  now  we  have  pink  in  the

darker  shades  i  may  even  want  to  make

this  a  little  darker  so  you  can  see  it

better  but  im  sure  you  get  the  idea

thats  one  way  that  you  can  do  that

and  if  i  come  over  here  to  color  two  i

could  change  that  the  lighter  shades  to

something  like  yellow  to  change  up  how

that  works

okay  and  once  youre  finished  you  can  go

ahead  and  click  apply

and  then  close  out  of  the  menu  that  is

how  you  can  go  about  applying  a  simple

color  overlay  or  even  a  duotone  effect

to  a  photograph  using  inkscape  if  you

have  any  questions  let  me  know  and  as

always  thanks  for  watching
