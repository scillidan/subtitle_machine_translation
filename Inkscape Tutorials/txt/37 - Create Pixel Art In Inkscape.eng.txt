in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  trace  pixel  art  from  images

using  inkscape  now  there  is  a  built-in

feature  for  auto  tracing  your  pixel  art

but  it  doesnt  always  produce  the

desired  results  in  these  instances  it

would  be  good  to  know  how  to  trace  pixel

art  manually  which  well  be  going  over

in  todays  tutorial



so  getting  us  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  youll  want  to  do  is

import  the  graphic  that  youd  like  to

trace  over  into  inkscape  as  you  can  see

that  ive  done  here  now  for  this

demonstration  i  will  be  using  this

vector  illustration  of  a  fox  that  i

downloaded  from  123rf.com

so  once  you  have  your  graphic  imported

lets  turn  on  the  grid  lets  come  up

here  to  where  it  says  view

and  where  it  says  page  grid  go  ahead  and

select  that

now  by  default  your  grid  should  be  one

pixel  by  one  pixel  in  size  but  we  can

ensure  that  by  going  to  document

properties  so  lets  come  up  here  to  file

and  go  to  document  properties

and  then  come  over  here  to  the

grids  tab

and  then  down  here  where  it  says  spacing

x  and  spacing  y  it  should  be  one  and  one

by  default  if  yours  isnt  one  and  one  go

ahead  and  change  that  so  that  your  grid

is  spaced  out  one  pixel  by  one  pixel  and

the  end  result  of  that  if  you  zoom  in

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  roll  up  my

mouse  wheel  if  you  zoom  in  you  can  see

all  of  the  individual  pixels  represented

by  these  grid  lines  here  were  going  to

use  these  grid  lines  as  a  reference  for

tracing  over  our  image  so  let  me  zoom

back  out  here

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  take  my  graphic

and  scale  it  down  really  small  i  want  to

scale  it  down  so  small  that  one  pixel

squares  that  will  will  seem  large  in

comparison  to  it  so  im  going  to  grab

the  transformation  handle  here  im  going

to  hold  control  on  my  keyboard  to  lock

the  proportions  and  im  going  to  scale

this  down  pretty  small  maybe  down  to

like  um

i  dont  know  150  pixels  wide  and  you

could  see  what  the  width  is  while  youre

scaling  by  referencing  the  toolbar  the

tool  settings  menu  towards  the  top  of

the  screen  so  im  going  to  set  mine

right  at  about  150  and  that  that  right

there  looks  good  now  let  me  zoom  in  on

this

as  you  can  see  these  individual  squares

here  were  going  to  create  boxes  that

fill  these  squares

in  the  color  of  the  graphic  beneath  it

and  then  its  going  to  create  like  a

pixel  effect  beneath  it  so  let  me  just

reposition  this  a little  bit  i  want  this

i  want  the  tip  of  the  foxs  nose  here  up

against  this  square  grid  line

there  we  go  so  now  lets  go  ahead  and

create  our  initial  box  what  we  want  to

do  first  is  enable  snapping  which  is  up

here  this  little  magnet  icon  turn  that

on  and  then  from  this  drop  down  menu

where  it  says  uh  bounding  boxes  and

nodes  we  want  those  two  enabled  but  we

dont  want  alignment  enabled  thats  the

settings  we  want  right  now

so  im  going  to  grab  my  rectangle  tool

and  im  just  going  to  click  and  drag

like  this  to  create  a  box  it  should  snap

to  the  grid  lines  nice  and  evenly  as  you

saw  here  and  once  youve  done  that  you

can  disable  the  node  setting  in  the  uh

snapping  options  were  going  to  leave

were  going  to  leave  bounding  boxes

enabled  but  for  the  rest  of  this

tutorial  were  going  to  leave  these  two

disabled  and  now  im  going  to  take  this

im  going  to  grab  my  dropper  im  going

to  make  this  the  same  color  as  the  foxs

nose  like  that  and  now  ill  grab  my

selection  tool  and  ill  just  snap  that

in  there  like  that

let  me  zoom  in  a  little  bit  now  to

duplicate  that  im  going  to  press  ctrl  d

on  the  keyboard  and  im  going  to  move

this  copy  over  here

and  if  you  want  to  stamp  copies  while

youre  doing  this  you  could  just  hold

the  click  and  then  press  the  space  bar

and  itll  stamp  a  copy  like  that  and

ill  put  another  one  down  here  for  the

foxs  nose  like  that  and  ill  just  leave

that  one  there

okay  so  now  im  going  to  duplicate  this

again  im  going  to  press  ctrl  d  to

duplicate  this  i  want  to  make  this  one

the  same  color  as  this  shade  right  here

so  im  going to  grab  my  dropper  again

and  go  like  that  and  there  we  go  now  we

have  that  box  and  im  just  going  to

stamp  that  in  there  and  try  to  follow

along  the  lines  of  the  subject  here

although  its  not  going  to  be  exactly

precise

what  youre  going  for  is  a  close

representation  its  not  going  to  be

exact  but  if  you  just  follow  along  um  in

a  rudimentary  way  it  should  look  good

once  youre  finished  and  zoomed  out

okay  so  let  me  put  these  over  here

and  again  to  stamp  these  copies  im  just

pressing  the  spacebar

on  my  keyboard  to  do  that

now  if  you  notice  here  its  hard  to  see

whats  actually  going  on  so  what  i  would

recommend  doing  is  clicking  on  the  image

and  reducing  the  opacity  of  it  im  going

to  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

which  is  located  over  here

and  over  here  where  it  says  opacity  im

going  to  bring  that  down

and  i  would  even  recommend  making  the

page  darker  than  white  so  that  you  can

see  the  white  boxes  when  we  start

creating  them  so  im  going  to  come  back

to  the  document  properties  tab  and  come

over  here  to  the  display  tab  and  where

it  says  page  im  going  to  click  on  that

and  im  going to  make  that  a  darker

shade  im  going to  make  that  maybe

something  like  gray  so  we  can  see  a

little  better

okay  so  let  me  zoom  back  in  here

let  me  uh  create  some  more  boxes

to  fill  in  my  subject  here

im  going  to  create  the  ear  right  here

and  use  this  color  so  let  me  bring  the

opacity  of  this  image  back  up  so  i  can

sample  a  better  so  i  can  sample  that

color  properly  properly  back  to  the  fill

and  stroke  menu  with  the  image  selected

bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up  there

we  go

and  let  me  create  a  duplicate  of  this

box  right  here  to  move  the  page  around

im  just  pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel

and  moving  the  mouse  let  me  take  this

one  duplicate  that  by  pressing  ctrl  d

and  ill  make  this  a  darker  shade  let  me

grab  my  dropper  tool  right  here

make  that  a  darker  shade  like  that  and  i

may  even  change  these  boxes  right  here

to  be  the  same  color

just  for  consistency

okay  thats  a  nice  contrasting  shade

compared  to  the  other  orange  so  im

going  to  leave  that  as  it  is

let  me  make  copies  in  here  again  just

pressing  the  space  bar  to  stamp  copies

there  we  go

ill  put  some  copies  up  here

for  this  part  of  the  ear

there  we  go

now  im  not  what  im  doing  right  here  is

im  not  filling  in  the  entire  subject

im  just  creating  like  an  outline  around

the  main  areas  let  me  turn  the  opacity

of  that  image  back  down  so  i  can  see  a

little  better  there  we  go  we  want  to  try

not  to  make  duplicate  copies  of  squares

in  those  grid  lines  if  possible

there  we  go

let  me  just  make  an  outline  here  going

around  the  outline  of  the  shading

okay  looking  good

do  this  one  as  well

and  dont  worry  about  it  being  exactly

flush  with  the  uh  boundaries  of  the

subject  its  not  gonna  be  perfect  but

thats  okay  it  doesnt  have  to  be

perfect  so  let  me  fill  this  in  a  little

more

okay  now  im  gonna  fill  in  the  ear  up

here  using  these  colors  again  ctrl  d  to

duplicate  and  then  just  click  and  drag

and  press  down  the  space  bar  to  stamp

copies  of  it  as  you  see  me  doing  here

okay  so  now  im  going  to  start  filling

in  the  white  area  here  and  this  is  where

youll  see  why  it  is  that  i  change  the

page  border  or  the  page  color  rather

because  it  makes  it  easier  to  see  the

white  im  going to  make  that  box  white

and  now  you  can  see  it  much  easier  up

against  that  backdrop  there  you  can  see

exactly  where  the  white  boxes  or  pixels

as  theyre  supposed  to  be  are  being

placed

and  a  little  shortcut  for  filling  in

these  large  areas  you  dont  have  to

create  individual  boxes  for  each  of

these  areas  you  can  just  take  one  of

these  transformation  handles  and  bring

it  down  like  that  and  as  you  can  see  it

just  fills  in  the  whole  area  nice  and

easily  without  having  to  create  too  many

other  copies  in  fact  you  could  take

these  existing  copies  right  there  and

just  fill  them  in  like  that  as  you  can

see  there  okay  so  if  i  if  i  zoom  out  a

little  bit  you  can  see  this  thing  is

starting  to  come  together  you  could

actually  take  the  original  image  and

press  delete  to  get  rid  of  it  just  to

give  you  a  temporary  look  at  how  its

coming  along  now  if  you  want  to  get  your

image  back  just  just  do  an  undo  which  is

ctrl  z

ctrl  z  on  the  keyboard  undoes  your  last

action  so  it  puts  it  back  there  and  now

im  just  gonna  go  and  fill  in  this  part

of  the  shading  of  the  subject  here  using

these  darker

boxes  okay  so  now  that  thats  filled  in

im  going  to  fill  in  this  area  over  here

this  part  of  the  darker  shading  as  well

okay  so  as  you  can  see  here  its

starting  to  come  along  nicely  if  i

delete  this  you  can  see  its  starting  to

come  together  a  little  bit  still  got  a  a

ways  to  go  here  i  think  what  ill  do

next  is  ill  fill  in  this  lighter  area  i

guess  this  reflection  of  light  on  the

foxs  back  right  here

okay  so  next  up  i  will  fill  in  the  tail

here  these  three  different  areas  of  the

tail  and  then  i  will  fill  in  the  larger

part  of  the  body  and  then  we  will  be

finished



okay  so  im  pretty  much  finished  here  i

just  have  to  fill  in  this  large  area

right  here  which  i  could  fill  in  by

creating  individual  boxes  but  it  would

be  pretty  tedious  so  what  im  going  to

do  is  im  going to  take  a  little  bit  of

a  shortcut  here  and  use  the  bezier  pen

to  just  manually  draw  a  shape  and  fill

it  in  with  the  color  that  would

otherwise  be  filled  here  so  let  me  turn

off  my  snapping  to  do  that  im  going  to

grab  the  bezier  pen  and  this  is  a  trick

you  may  want  to  employ  yourself

depending  on  the  image  youre  working

with  if  it  has  large  areas  of  a  single

color  like  this

you  may  want  to  do  something  like  this

yourself  so  let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen

over  here  keyboard  shortcut  is  b  let  me

zoom  in  on  this

and  im  just  going  to  draw  a  shape  going

through  the  edges  here  that  im  going  to

use  to  fill  in  the  rest  of  this  object

and  then  we  will  be  finished

so  let  me  just  uh

come  around  the  edges  here  like  this

there  we  go

back  to  the  starting  point

and  i  will  make  this  the  same  color

as  the  object  that  id  like  to  the  boxes

i  would  have  filled  in  there  otherwise

and  i  can  get  rid  of  that  outline  by

holding  shift

and  clicking  on  this  little  x  down  here

now  im  going  to  take  this  grab  this

selection  tool  im  going  to  send  that  to

the  bottom  using  this  button  right  here

lower  selection  to  the  bottom

and  then  im  going  to  raise  it  one  step

by  uh  clicking  this  button  next  to  it

that  says

or  two  buttons  over  to  the  left  that

says  raise  selection  one  step  and  now  it

should  be  over  the  original  image  now

let  me  zoom  out  a little  bit

let  me  take  the  original  image  and  move

it  out  of  the  way

as  you  can  see  here  were  pretty  much

finished  we  have  our  vector

pixel  art  that  we  created  from  the

vector  fox  here

now  if  i  zoom  out  one  more  thing  i

wanted  to  point  out  lets  turn  off  the

page  grid  im  going to  come  up  here  to

where  it  says  view

where  it  says  page  grid  im  going  to

deselect  that

now  if  you  notice

theres  space  showing  through

these  boxes  in  here

because  of  the  way  vector  graphics  work

in  general  this  isnt  just  an

inkscape  problem  this  happens  in  every

vector  application  youre  going  to

notice  these  little  these  little  gaps

between  the  boxes  here  maybe  its  not  so

apparent  on  my  screen  if  i  were  to  make

this  page  background  a  little  darker

youd  probably  see  it  you  can  see  more

of  those

um  lines  showing  through  between  the

boxes  the  way  that  we  remedy  this  is

just  by  selecting  everything  and

duplicating  it  so  let  me  select

everything  here

i  actually  want  to  select  everything

except  for  this  large  image  in  here  or

this  large  object  that  i  drew  with  the

bezier  pen  so  to  deselect  just  that  part

im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on

that  to  deselect  it  and  now  i  should

just  have  the  boxes  selected  and  with

the  boxes  selected  you  can  duplicate

them  by  pressing  ctrl  d  on  the  keyboard

and  there  you  go  if  you  zoom  out  those

uh  gaps  should  be  gone  if  theyre  not

you  could  just  duplicate  it  one  more

time  and  that  should  do  the  trick

and  there  you  go  that  is  how

you  can  fix  that  problem

and  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

creating  uh  simple  pixel  art  tracings

over  vector  graphics  using  inkscape  if

you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  i  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  i  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  17

one  time  and  youre  in  for  life  ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as
