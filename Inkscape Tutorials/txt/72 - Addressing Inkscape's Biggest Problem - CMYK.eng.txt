Inkscape  is  an  incredible  piece  of

software  that  Ive  been  using  for  over  a

decade  to  create  designs  for  myself  and

my  clients  as  much  as  I  love  Inkscape

though  theres  one  particular  problem

that  has  it  Ill  be  addressing  in  this

video  and  Ill  also  be  going  over  some

solutions  for  working  around  it  as  well



this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  video  Ill  be  discussing  how  you

can  work  around  ink  scapes  in  ability  to

generate  files  with  the  CMYK  color

profile  and  if  youd  like  to  learn  more

about  how  Inkscape  works  be  sure  to

check  out  my  Inkscape  masterclass  its  a

collection  of  over  60  videos  where  I  go

over  every  tool  and  feature  in  Inkscape

and  I  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  Ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  so  one  of  the  biggest

downsides  of  working  with  Inkscape  is

its  inability  to  generate  files  with  the

CMYK  color  profile  this  is  problematic

when  designing  things  for  prints  because

the  only  colors  that  can  be  generated

with  ink  are  colors  that  are  within  the

CMYK  color  space

Inkscape  by  default  works  within  the  RGB

color  space  these  are  colors  that  are

generated  using  light  and  are  intended

for  use  on  screens  and  other  electronics

with  digital  displays  because  of  that

the  RGB  color  space  has  a  wider  range  of

colors  to  work  with  than  CMYK  does

because  light  can  be  used  to  generate

more  colors  than  ink  n  so  if  you  create

a  design  with  Inkscape  then  you  go  to

print  it  chances  are  youre  going  to  be

using  colors  that  are  out  of  gamut  or  in

other  words  not  within  the  range  of  what

can  be  created  with  ink  most  print  shops

will  refuse  to  print  your  document  if

this  is  the  case  because  they  know  that

youre  not  going  to  be  happy  with  the

result  now  you  may  think  to  yourself

okay  Ill  just  use  colors  that  are

within  the  CMYK  color  space  that  it

should  be  fine  right  well  not  exactly

its  a  little  more  complicated  than  just

using  CMYK  colors  every  document  has  a

color  profile  embedded  within  it  and  if

you  created  that  document  with  Inkscape

then  its  going  to  have  an  RGB  profile

because  thats  the  only  format  Inkscape

supports  the  problem  with  printing  an

RGB  document  is  that  youre  taking

colors  that  were  originally  generated

using  light

and  trying  to  reproduce  them  with  ink

this  usually  results  in  their  finished

printed  product  having  colors  that  look

dull  and  muddy  and  just  overall

different  than  they  did  on  your  screen

when  you  design  them  even  if  you  made

sure  to  only  use  colors  that  work  within

the  CMYK  color  space  its  just  not

possible  for  something  to  look  the  same

in  print  as  it  does  on  your  screen  if

youre  creating  it  in  an  RGB  color

profile  and  because  of  that  a  lot  of

print  shops  will  immediately  turn  down

your  document  if  they  see  that  it  has  an

RGB  profile  embedded  now  some  print

shops  will  do  a  spot  conversion  and

adjust  the  colors  for  you  this  is

actually  becoming  a  lot  more  common  and

a  good  example  of  this  would  be  Vista

Print  Ive  printed  RGB  documents  with

them  in  the  past  and  the  results  were

actually  pretty  good  but  they  werent

perfect  the  best  way  to  ensure  that  your

design  will  look  the  same  in  print  as  it

does  on  your  device  is  to  make  sure  that

your  document  is  using  a  CMYK  color

profile  in  illustrator  this  can  be  done

by  going  to  file  document  color  mode  and

choosing  CMYK  color  an  affinity  designer

this  can  be  done  by  going  to  file

document  setup  clicking  on  the  color  tab

and  choosing  CMYK  from  the  color  format

drop-down  Inkscape  however  lacks  the

ability  to  do  this  and  its  one  of  the

biggest  downsides  of  working  with  it  in

my  opinion  designing  things  for  print  is

just  going  to  be  more  challenging  in

Inkscape  but  its  not  impossible

there  are  some  workarounds  for  creating

a  CMYK  document  from  your  Inkscape

designs  and  Id  like  to  share  some  of

them  with  you  in  this  video  now  I  must

warn  you  in  advance  that  these  methods

are  far  from  perfect

but  they  will  get  the  job  done  and  they

are  better  than  nothing

if  youre  a  Linux  user  theres  a

third-party  extension  that  you  can

install  for  Inkscape  that  will  allow  you

to  export  PDF  documents  with  a  CMYK

color  profile  the  extension  is  called

export  PDF  CMYK  and  Ill  have  a  link  in

the  description  for  those  of  you  who  are

linux  users  and  want  to  try  it  out  I

havent  tried  it  myself  but  Ive  heard

good  things  the  benefit  of  using

something  like  this  is  that  it  allows

you  to  export  your  design  in  an  editable

vector  format  where  you  can  manually

adjust  the  DPI  which  is  also  important

for  printing  documents  the  downside

though  is  that  you  can  only  export  a  PDF

document  so  if  your  print  shop  requires

a  rasterized  format  like  jpg  or  TI  F

youre  out  of  luck  the  other  downside  is

that  its  only  for  Linux  users  so  those

of  us  on  Windows  and  Mac  are  also  out  of

luck

Scribus  is  an  open-source  application

for  desktop  publishing  similar  to  Adobe

InDesign  and  its  available  for  all

three  operating  systems  one  great  thing

about  Scribus  is  that  it  allows  you  to

open  PDF  documents  that  were  originally

created  with  Inkscape  and  manually

change  the  colors  based  on  a  CMYK  color

profile  then  once  youre  done  you  can

export  your  design  as  a  PDF  document  and

you  will  now  have  a  print  ready  document

with  a  CMYK  color  profile  embedded  I

made  an  entire  tutorial  about  how  to  do

this  a  few  years  ago  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  Ill  have  it  linked  into

the  description  of  the  video

much  like  the  Linux  extension  the  upside

of  using  Scribus  is  that  you  can  get  an

editable  vector  format  that  most  print

shops  overwhelmingly  accept  the  downside

though  is  that  this  only  works  on  pure

vector  pads  if  your  design  uses  a  lot  of

Inkscape  specific  features  like  Gaussian

blurs  masking  clipped  objects  filters

and  so  on  theyre  not  going  to  translate

over  to  Scribus  unfortunately  in  that

case  youll  have  to  generate  a

rasterized  PNG  file  and  use  a  different

solution

Krita  is  an  open-source  design

application  that  functions  sort  of  like

a  hybrid  between  Inkscape  and  it

allows  you  to  work  with  and  create

vector  objects  but  it  also  allows  you  to

paint  and  manipulate  images  as  well  one

major  benefit  of  use  in  Krita  is  that  it

has  the  ability  to  export  CMYK  documents

already  built-in  there  is  a  catch  though

you  wont  be  able  to  export  your  design

in  a  vector  format  like  SVG  or  PDF

credit  does  allow  you  to  export  in  these

formats  but  unfortunately  your  document

will  be  forced  into  having  an  RGB  color

profile  Krita  is  ideal  if  you  need  a

flattened  raster  format  like  PNG  jpg  and

TI  F  those  formats  can  be  exported  with

the  CMYK  color  profile  to  do  so  first

export  your  design  from  Inkscape  as  a

PNG  file  then  open  it  up  with  credit

then  navigate  to  image  properties  and

under  the  image  color  space  tab  select

the  CMYK  option  from  the  model  drop-down

from  there  you  can  export  your  design  in

any  restor  format  and  it  will  have  a

print  ready  CMYK  color  profile  embedded

another  way  that  you  can  convert  your

Inkscape  document  to  CMYK  is  to  use  a

web-based  color  conversion  service

theres  a  lot  of  them  out  there  but  the

one  Im  most  familiar  with  would  be  RGB

to  CMYK  org  this  allows  you  to  take  a

PNG  file  that  you  exported  from  Inkscape

and  convert  it  to  either  jpg  or  TI  F

format  with  the  CMYK  color  profile

embedded  the  benefit  of  using  a  site

like  this  is  that  its  quick  and

convenient  and  you  wont  have  to

download  any  additional  software  the

downside  though  is  that  youre  limited

to  only  those  two  formats  and  another

problem  Ive  noticed  with  web-based

converters  like  this  is  that  they  tend

to  produce  inconsistent  results  and  you

dont  get  to  see  how  the  final  design

looks  before  saving  it  Ive  had

instances  where  the  final  design  looks

so  different  from  the  original  in  terms

of  color  that  it  was  hardly  usable

the  final  solution  for  generating  a  CMYK

document  from  your  Inkscape  design  is  to

simply  save  it  as  an  SVG  file  then  open

it  up  with  illustrator  or  affinity

designer  and  correct  the  colors  yourself

personally  I  think  this  is  the  best  way

to  approach  the  CMYK  problem  as  an

Inkscape  user  because  it  gives  you  the

most  control  with  all  of  the  other

methods  I  discussed  youre  basically

just  taking  your  document  and  swapping

out  the  color  profile  without  ever

having  an  opportunity  to  correct  your

colors  once  theyve  been  converted

illustrator  allows  you  to  do  that  though

and  I  have  an  entire  tutorial  about

converting  RGB  colors  to  CMYK  while

maintaining  their  vibrance  on  my  other

channel  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

Ill  have  that  link  in  the  description

as  well  this  is  actually  what  I  do

myself  since  Inkscape  is  the  software

Im  most  familiar  with  its  what  I  use

for  most  of  my  design  work  and  that  does

include  designs  that  are  made  for  print

once  Im  finished  creating  my  design  in

Inkscape  I  simply  open  it  up  with

illustrator  set  the  color  mode  to  CMYK

adjust  the  colors  as  needed  and  then

export  it  to  whatever  format  Id  like

and  thats  another  benefit  of  using  this

approach  youre  not  confined  to  just  PDF

or  just  jpg  you  can  save  your  work  in

any  format  imaginable  and  itll  have  a

CMYK  color  profile  embedded  you  can  even

save  your  work  directly  as  an

illustrator  file  which  believe  it  or  not

some  print  shops  do  require  the  same  can

be  done  with  affinity  designer  as  well

just  open  your  Inkscape  SVG  change  the

document  color  mode  to  CMYK  adjust  your

colors  as  needed  then  save  your  work  to

whatever  format  youd  like  I  understand

that  these  two  applications  are  not  free

and  because  of  that  this  may  not  be  a

feasible  option  for  some  of  you  until

Inkscape  implements  some  kind  of  support

for  CMYK

this  is  the  best  option  we  have  and  I

would  highly  recommend  it  if  you  are  in

a  position  to  acquire  one  of  these  two

programs  if  not  that  any  of  the  other

methods  that  were  discussed  in  this

video  should  work  just  fine  that  should

do  it  for  todays  video  if  you  have  any

questions  leave  a  comment  below  and  as

always  thanks  for  watching
