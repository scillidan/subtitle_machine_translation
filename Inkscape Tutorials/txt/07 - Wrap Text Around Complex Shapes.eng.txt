in  previous  tutorials  I  demonstrated  how

you  can  wrap  text  around  simple  shapes

like  a  circle  by  using  the  place  on  text

command  however  in  this  tutorial  Im

going  to  show  you  how  you  can  wrap  text

around  more  complicated  shapes  such  as  a

heart  and  to  show  you  what  I  mean  if  I

were  to  select  both  of  these  objects

here  and  go  to  text  and  select  put  on

path  you  can  see  we  dont  get  a  very

good  outcome  we  dont  get  to  choose  the

placement  of  the  text  on  the  path  it

just  randomly  chooses  it  and  you  cant

choose  a  different  start  or  end  point

for  this  text  so  to  get  this  result  what

were  going  to  do  is  were  going  to

create  separate  paths  for  each  half  of

the  heart  and  then  create  separate  lines

of  text  for  each  path  so  let  me  get

started  on  that  Im  going  to  grab  my

selection  tool  and  instead  of  placing

the  text  directly  on  this  path  Im  going

to  place  it  on  a  copy  of  the  path  so  Im

going  to  create  a  linked  offset  Im

actually  going  to  create  an  offset  copy

of  the  shape  so  I  could  place  the  text

around  the  outside  padding  of  the  shape

instead  of  placing  it  directly  on  top  of

the  shape  so  let  me  select  this  object  I

will  go  to  path  and  I  will  select  linked

offset  and  then  I  will  go  to  my  nodes

tool  and  I  will  pull  this  node  out  to

create  a  little  bit  of  an  offset  and  I

will  give  this  a  different  color  just  so

I  could  differentiate  it  from  the

original  shape  and  Ill  pull  this  out  to

about

there  and  now  Im  going  to  convert  this

to  a  path  by  going  to  path  object  to

path  and  I  want  to  apply  a  stroke  to

this  so  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool

Im  going  to  hold  the  shift  key  and  Im

going  to  click  the  letter  or  the  color

blue  just  to  apply  a  blue  stroke  and

then  Im  going  to  remove  remove  the  fill

color  now  let  me  make  that  stroke  a

little  smaller  Im  going  to  open  up  my

fill  and  stroke  menu  by  double  clicking

this  stripe  down  here  Ill  go  to  the

stroke  style  Tab  and  Im  just  going  to

make  that

one  so  the  approach  Im  going  to  use

here  is  Im  going  to  break  this  up  into

separate  pads  and  then  Place  separate

lines  on  each  path  so  let  me  select  this

object  and  Im  going  to  go  to  my  nodes

tool  and  I  want  to  select  this  node

right  here  and  I  want  to  break  the  path

at  that  node  so  Ill  come  up  here  to

this  icon  that  says  break  path  at

selected  nodes  when  you  your  cursor  over

and  Ill  click  on  that  and  nothing  Vis

visibly  changes  on  your  screen  but  the

path  has  now  been  broken  up  into

separate  nodes  as  you  can  see  there  and

Ill  come  down  here  and  do  the  same

thing  I  Want  to  Break  these  paths  up  as

well  so  let  me  select  those  and  Im

going  to  break  those  paths  as  well  and

now  Im  going  to  break  apart  the  entire

shape  so  let  me  go  back  to  my  select

tool  I  will  go  to  path  and  select  break

apart  and  now  I  can  just  take  this

little  piece  down  here  and  get  rid  of

this  and  if  you  can  see  now  we  have

separate  paths  for  each  half  of  the

shape  and  what  Im  going  to  do  is  create

separate  lines  of  text  one  line  of  text

going  on  this  side  and  another  line

going  on  this  side  so  I  have  one  line  of

text  right  now  I  want  to  break  this  up

into  two  so  let  me  duplicate  this  by

pressing  contrl  D  or  command  D  if  youre

on  Mac  and  the  way  that  I  set  this  up  is

I  had  up  until  the  word  four  going  over

here  and  then  after  that  the  right  side

begins  so  Im  going  to  end  the  line  of

text  after  the  word  four  Im  going  to

grab  my  text

tool  so  now  that  I  have  my  two  SE

separate  lines  of  text  Im  going  to  take

this  line  of  text  hold  shift  click  on

this  left  path  and  then  go  to  text  and

select  put  on

path  now  we  end  up  with  this  effect  here

which  is  not  what  Im  going  for  so  Im

going  to  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

it  Im  going  to  select  just  the  path  and

now  to  place  the  text  on  the  outside  of

the  path  rather  than  the  inside  Im

going  to  reverse  the  direction  of  the

path  so  I  will  go  to  path  and  select  if

I  can  find  it  reverse  there  it  is  and

now  its  going  to  put  it  on  the  outside

so  the  problem  I  have  now  is  I  have  to

make  this  text  a  little  bigger  to  fill

in  the  rest  of  this  empty  space  here  so

let  me  grab  my  text  tool  and  Im  going

to  Triple  click  this  text  to  select  it

and  Im  going  to  make  the  size  of  this  a

little  bigger  Im  going  to  try  something

like  30  you  see  how  that  looks  Ill

increase  that  maybe

34  okay  34  looks  good  whatever  size  you

use  make  a  mental  note  what  size  that  is

because  were  going  to  use  that  same

size  for  this  text  object  here  so  that

these  two  lines  of  text  look

consistent  so  now  thats  done  and  Ill

come  over  here  and  do  the  same  thing

Ill  select  this  text  object  hold  shift

click  on  the  path  and  go  to  text  and

select  put  on

path  now  Im  going  to  have  to  do  the

same  thing  here  with  the  reversing  of

the  pads  Im  going  to  select  the  path

just  the  path  and  go  to  path  and  select

reverse  and  then  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  Im  going  to  grab  my  text  tool

select  all  the  text  and  I  want  to  make

this  the  same  size  Ill  make  this

34  and  Im  going  to  change  the  spacing

of  this  a  little  bit  I  mentioned  earlier

that  you  cant  really  change  the

position  of  the  text  on  the  path  you  can

a  little  bit  by  adding  spacing  between

the  letters  so  Im  going  to  place  the

cursor  before  the  text  and  just  press  my

space  bar  to  add  some  space  in  there  and

if  you  want  to  add  some  more  space

between  individual  letters  just  move

your  cursor  around  with  the  arrows  if

you  place  the  cursor  between  two  letters

you  can  hold  the  ALT  key  and  use  your

left  and  right  arrows  to  increase  and

decrease  the  spacing  between  the  text  or

if  youre  using  Mac  like  me  you  can  use

the  option  case  so  Im  holding  option

and  then  using  my  right  arrow  key  to

increase  spacing  between  the  letters  and

the  left  Arrow  key  to  decrease  it

and  once  youre  finished  you  can  grab

your  selection  tool  if  you  dont  want

this  ugly  path  sitting  in  your  way  you

can  select  the  path  and  then  turn  off

well  make  sure  you  have  it  selected

because  its  going  to  select  the  text

first  Im  going  to  hold  the  ALT  key  or

the  option  key  and  click  again  so  that

it  grabs  the  path  rather  than  the  text

itself  and  youll  know  you  have  the  path

selected  when  you  see  the  colored  stripe

down  there  and  Im  going  to  turn  off  the

visibility  of  that  path  by  holding  shift

and  clicking  the  X  and  now  its  gone  and

Ill  do  the  same  thing  over  here  to  this

path  I  will  select  it

hold  shift  click  the  X  to  turn  off  the

visibility  and  now  the  path  is  no  longer

visible  its  still  there  its  just  not

visible  if  you  want  to  see  it  at  any

point  you  can  just  come  up  here  to  where

it  says  view  go  to  display  mode  and

choose  outline  overview  and  you  can  see

where  that  path  is  just  make  sure  to  go

back  to  the  normal  View  mode  once  youre

done  so  let  me  go  to  view  display  mode

and  choose  normal  and  there  we  go  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we
