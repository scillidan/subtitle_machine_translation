in  this  video  Ill  be  going  over  working

with  clones  which  sounds  similar  to

working  with  duplicates  but  its

actually  a  little  different  and  Ill  be

explaining  that  in  this  video  so  lets

go  ahead  and  get  started  here  just  for

example  Im  gonna  go  ahead  and  create  a

little  ellipse  like  that  and  a  little

red  circle  like  that  Im  gonna  convert

it  to  a  path  and  were  gonna  do  now  is

Im  gonna  go  to  edit  clone  and  Im  gonna

click  the  option  that  says  create  clone

what  thats  gonna  do  is  its  gonna

create  a  cloned  copy  of  that  original

circle  now  you  may  be  asking  yourself

well  why  dont  I  just  create  a  duplicate

instead  why  dont  it  is  right-click  it

and  go  to  duplicate  well  this  is

slightly  different  here  this  object  this

cloned  object  is  linked  to  this  object

here  so  whatever  I  do  to  this  object

its  gonna  happen  to  that  object  as  well

let  me  show  you  as  an  example  Ill  scale

that  down  and  that  scales  down  as  well  I

turn  that  green  that  turns  green  as  well

I  go  to  the  paths  I  go  to  the  other

nodes  tool  might  change  the  nodes  and  it

happens  to  that  as  well  this  is

virtually  a  copy  of  this  object  here  and

anything  I  do  to  this  will  happen  to

this  as  well  if  you  notice  here  if  you

want  to  look  at  the  nodes  theres  no

actual  nodes  here  that  I  can  edit  if  I

want  to  edit  this  clone  I  have  to  edit

the  original  clone  first  in  order  to  do

that  now  if  I  want  to  make  this  clone

its  very  own  object  and  make  it  so

thats  no  longer  linked  to  this  object

right  here  what  I  can  do  is  go  to  edit

clone  and  I  can  click  on  unlink  clone

and  now  it  becomes  its  own  object  and  if

you  notice  here  you  can  see  theres  the

nodes  and  everything  and  when  I  go  and

edit  this  object  over  here  it  doesnt

happen  to  that  object  there  so  thats

how  that  works  now  lets  go  to  edit

clone  relink  -  copied  okay  how  this

works  is  let  me  create  another  copy  Im

gonna  take  this  object  Ill  go  to  edit

clone  create  yet  create  clone  and  heres

a  cloned  object  right  here  what  I  can  do

is  instead  of  take  instead  of  linking

this  clone  to  this  object  I  can  instead

link  it  to  this  object  let  me  just  edit

that  a  little  bit  do  something  like  that

what  I  can  do  is  I  can  copy  that  by

right-clicking  it  and  going  to  copy  or

you  can  just  hit  ctrl  C  on  the  keyboard

and  then  I  could  take  this  clone  right

here  and  go  to  edit  clone

relink  -  copied  and  what  that  does  is  it

real  inks  it  to  that  object  there  if  you

notice  here  made  it  that  same  exact

thing  so  thats  how  that  works

you  look  here  again  edit  clone  select

original  okay  so  lets  say  we  have  a

bunch  of  objects  here  right  Im  gonna

create  a  bunch  of  copies  of  this  clone  a

bunch  of  clones  of  the  clone  Im  gonna

mix  these  all  together  and  shuffle  them

all  around  and  you  want  to  select  the

original  so  you  can  edit  all  of  them  but

you  dont  know  what  you  want  is  the

original  so  what  you  do  is  you  just

click  on  any  one  of  them  and  go  to  edit

clone  select  original  and  then  itll

show  you  where  the  original  one  is  and

then  you  can  go  and  edit  that  further

like  that  so  thats  the  basics  of  how

clones  work  theres  a  couple  of  other

things  I  want  to  show  you  here  in  this

menu  clone  clone  original  path  thats  a

live  a  path  thats  a  live  path  effect

which  is  something  thats  totally

different  Ill  be  going  over  that  in  its

own  video  and  then  theres  create  tiled

clones  which  this  is  an  entirely  long

video  in  and  of  itself  which  Ill  be

going  over  next  but  thats  the  basics  of

how  you  can  work  with  clones  in  Inkscape
