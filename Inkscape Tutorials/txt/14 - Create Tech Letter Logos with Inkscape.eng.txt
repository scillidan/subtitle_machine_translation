in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  these  technologically

styled  letters  that  look  like  theyre

made  of  circuits  using  nothing  but

strokes  and  shapes  in  inkscape  so  Ill

come  over  here  into  a  new  document  and

Ill  get  started  the  first  thing  I  want

to  do  is  grab  the  rectangle  tool  and

click  and  drag  on  the  cvas  to  draw  a

rectangle  I  want  to  hold  my  control  key

while  I  do  that  so  we  have  a  perfectly

symmetrical  square  like  that  then  Im

going  to  remove  the  fill  color  from  that

rectangle  by  clicking  this  red  X  down

here  in  the  bottom  left  corner  and  I

want  to  apply  a  black  stroke  to  this

object  by  holding  the  shift  key  and

clicking  on  the  black  Swatch  down  here

in  my  color  palette  and  now  we  have  a

square  with  a  black

outline  so  lets  come  over  here  to  the

selection  tool  come  up  here  to  the  tool

settings  menu  uh  where  this  icon  that

says  when  scaling  objects  scale  the

stroke  width  by  the  same  proportion

lets  turn  that  off  for  this  tutorial

and  now  lets  change  the  size  of  the

stroke  here  so  Im  going  to  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  by  going  to  object

and  selecting  fill  and  stroke

and  from  this  menu  Ill  come  over  here

to  the  stroke  style  Tab  and  I  want  to

make  sure  the  stroke  width  is  five

pixels  so  mines  already  set  to  five

pixels  if  yours  isnt  just  manually  type

that  in  and  change  the  units  of

measurement  to  pixels  Here  and  Now  I

want  to  make  this  Square  100  by  100

pixels  so  Ill  come  up  here  to  the

toolbar  where  we  have  the  width  and  the

height  Im  going  to  turn  on  this  lock

icon  between  the  two  of  them  to  make

sure  that  were  locking  the  proportions

as  we  scale  and  Im  going  to  change  this

to  100  and  press  enter  and  now  we  have  a

100  100  by  100  rectangle  uh  with  a  five

pixel

stroke  so  what  Im  going  to  do  now  is

Im  going  to  duplicate  this  Im  going  to

right  click  this  and  go  to  duplicate  and

Im  going  to  add  25  pixels  to  each

Dimension  so  this  one  will  be  125  pixels

so  Ill  write  in  125  and  press  enter  and

then  Ill  do  this  one  more  time  Ill

right  click  this  go  to  duplicate  and

Ill  make  this  one  150  so  Ill  write  in

1  15  and  press  enter  and  there  we  go  and

now  Im  going  to  select  all  three  of

these  and  I  just  want  to  Center  them  up

vertically  and  horizontally  so  Ill  open

up  the  the  alignment  menu  by  going  to

object  and  selecting  align

distribute  and  from  this  menu  I  want  to

choose  last  selected  from  this  drop  down

and  Ill  Center  them  up  vertically  and

horizontally  just  like  that  so  with  all

of  these  objects  selected  lets  go  to

path  and  select  object  to  path  so  that

now  these  are  no  longer  rectangles  these

are  pure  Vector  paths  and  Im  going  to

grab  my  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  and  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  these  nodes

over  here  on  the  right  hand  side  to

select  them  let  me  try  that  again  if

youre  using  Max  sometimes  its

difficult  to  select  these  nodes  there  we

go  I  was  able  to  select  those  nodes  now

Im  going  to  come  up  here  to  the  tool

settings  menu  where  it  says  add  Corners

live  path  effect  Im  going  to  enable

that  and  when  I  do  that  youre  going  to

see  these  round  knots  that  appear  next

to  the  nodes  and  Im  going  to  select  the

nodes  again  and  Im  going  to  grab  this

white  node  right  here  and  just  bring

this  in  like  that  until  it  snaps  I  want

this  I  want  it  to  snap  right  in  the

center  there  before  you  do  that  though

let  me  back  up  a  little  bit  turn  on  your

snapping  menu  up  here  by  clicking  on

this  mag  magnet  icon  in  the  top  right

corner  and  then  do  that  again  so  let  me

uh  let  me  do  that  again  now  that  I  have

snapping  enabled  and  I  want  to  snap  them

together  just  like  that  youll  see  that

red  line  up  here  there  in  the  middle  Im

going  to  do  the  same  thing  with  these

other  nodes  over  here  Im  going  to  snap

them  together  so  we  have  nice  rounded

edges  like

that  and  once  we  do  that  we  can  finalize

this  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

object  to  path  now  with  all  with  all  of

these  objects  still  selected  Im  going

to  select  over  all  of  these  nodes  right

here  and  I  want  to  break  all  of  them  up

so  Ill  come  over  here  to  the  tool

settings  menu  and  Im  looking  for  the

option  that  says  break  path  at  selected

nodes  and  when  I  click  on  that  its

going  to  break  them  all  up  into  separate

nodes  and  now  we  want  to  break  them  up

into  separate  objects  so  well  go  to

path  and  select  break  apart  and  click

off  of  the  the  graphic  lets  grab  this

selection  tool  and  click  off  of  it  to

deselect  everything  and  you  can  see  we

now  have  individual  pieces  of  this

entire  element  here  and  if  I  select  all

of  these  I  can  come  over  here  to  my  fill

and  stroke  menu  I  could  bring  down  the

opacity  roughly  in  half  and  just  so  you

can  see  where  the  start  and  end  point  is

of  each  of  these  lines  they  all  overlap

and  underlap  with  each  other  and  the

point  of  doing  this  is  that  we  now  have

these  individual  elements  that  we  can

use  to  construct  virtually  any  letter

that  wed  like  so  let  me  put  that  back

and  Im  going  to  zoom  out  Im  going  to

take  all  of  these  and  Im  going  to  right

click  them  and  go  to  duplicate  and  move

the  duplicate  copy  off  to  the  side  just

in  case  I  want  another  copy  to  work  with

if  I  want  to  create  other  letters  and

Im  going  to  use  these  objects  right

here  to  to  uh  create  the  letter  A  so  let

me  select  all  of  them  Im  going  to

rotate  them  around  by  clicking  on  the

objects  and  then  Im  going  to  get  those

rotation  handles  and  with  the  rotation

handles  enabled  Im  going  to  hold  the

control  key  and  just  roll  it  around

until  its  flat  like  that  and  Im  going

to  create  a  letter  A  out  of  this  right

here  Ill  come  back  over  here  to  show

you  what  I  mean  this  letter  a  is  what

were  going  to  create  so  let  me  come

back  into  inkscape  let  me  click  off  of

it  to  deselect  everything  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  over  these  three  pieces

right  here  and  Im  just  going  to  bring

them  up  and  Im  going  to  snap  them  up

here  I  want  this  object  to  snap  to  this

part  of  the  uh  the  starting  point  of

that  curve  right  there  so  Ill  snap  that

in

there  and  now  I  want  I  want  to  make

these  lines  right  here  all  the  same

height  so  I  want  to  take  these  lines  and

bring  them  down  so  that  theyre  the  same

height  as  these  ones  with  snapping

enabled  we  should  be  able  to  grab  the

nodes  tool  and  select  the  node  and  then

just  hold  control  and  bring  it  straight

down  and  it  may

snap  or  we  might  have  to  create  a  guide

for  that  so  it  didnt  snap  to  the  bottom

there  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going

to  create  a  guide  uh  you  should  have  a

ruler  on  your  canvas  up  here  if  you

dont  have  a  ruler  uh  as  is  the  case  on

my  screen  you  can  activate  it  by

pressing  control  r  on  your  keyboard  or

if  youre  using  Mac  it  would  be  command

R  and  once  we  have  that  ruler  we  can

click  and  drag  a  guide  down  here  and  Im

going  to  snap  that  Guide  to  the  bottom

of  this  path  right  here  and  now  I  could

take  these  paths  and  snap  them  down  to

the  bottom  of  the  guide  and  Im  holding

control  while  I  do  this  to  lock  the  line

onto  the  vertical  axis  if  Im  not

holding  control  its  going  to  wobble

around  like  that  holding  control  will

enable  you  to  lock  it  onto  that  axis  so

Ill  come  over  here  and  do  the  same

thing  Im  going  to  snap  these  lines  as

well  and  then  Im  going  to  zoom  back

out  and  Im  going  to  adjust  these  lines

here  so  let  me  select  this  line  in  the

middle  and  Im  going  to  take  this  node

and  bring  this  in  right  here  and  Im

holding  control  while  I  do  that  to  lock

it  onto  the  horizontal  axis  Im  going  to

bring  that  line  right  there  and  Ill  do

the  same  thing  over  here  on  this  side

Im  just  going  to  bring  these  lines  in

like  that  and  then  I  want  to  take  this

line  right  here  and  take  this  node  and

just  snap  it  down  here  and  Ill  do  the

same  thing  over  here  on  this  side  Ill

snap  this  line  onto  this  node  and  we  end

up  with  this  outcome  right  here  so  Im

going  to  get  rid  of  the  guide  now  Im

going  to  make  the  guide  Invisible  by

holding  shift  and  pressing  the  vert

vertical  Bar  Key  on  the  keyboard  and  Im

going  to  get  rid  of  the  ruler  as  well

Im  going  to  press  command  r  or  controlr

again  to  get  rid  of  that  and  what  we

have  here  is  we  have  all  of  these

individual  lines  for  each  segment  here

we  want  it  to  be  one  continuous  path  so

for  this  segment  here  this  is  not  a

continuous  path  this  is  broken  up  into

three  pieces  to  make  this  a  continuous

path  Im  going  to  select  all  of  the

objects  by  holding  shift  and  clicking  on

each  of  them  and  then  Ill  come  over

here  to  my  nodes  tool  and  I  want  to

select  all  of  these  nodes  Im  going  to

hold  shift  while  Im  doing  that  select

all  of  the  nodes  and  with  them  all

selected  Im  going  to  come  up  here  to

the  tool  settings  menu  where  it  says

join  selected  nodes  and  click  on  that

and  you  can  you  should  see  that  those

overlapping  segments  go  away  we  now  have

uh  combined  the  nodes  together  so  let  me

grab  my  selection  tool  if  you  notice  we

have  a  little  bit  of  an  extra  piece  that

got  left  out  here  this  is  kind  of  like  a

I  guess  you  could  consider  it  a

mathematical  error  with  working  with

vectors  its  really  not  supposed  to  be

there  but  it  happens  sometimes  let  me

put  that  back  if  you  have  this  on  your

screen  you  could  just  select  it  and  then

press  delete  on  your  keyboard  to  get  rid

of  it  and  now  were  going  to  do  the  same

thing  to  the  rest  of  these  paths  we  want

this  to  be  one  continuous  path  as  well

so  Im  going  to  select  each  of  these

Ill  come  over  here  to  my  nodes  tool

Ill  select  each  of  these  these  nodes

one  by  one  I  want  to  make  sure  theyre

all  selected  Im  going  to  hold  shift

while  I  do  that  to  make  sure  theyre  all

selected  and  Ill  unify  those  together

as  well  and  now  I  will  do  the  same  thing

to  this  line  that  runs  in  the  middle  so

Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  select  each

of  these  lines  and  then  Ill  click  and

drag  over  each  of  these  nodes  while

holding  shift  to  select  all  of  them  and

once  I  do  that  Ill  merge  them  together

as  well  now  thats  one  continuous  path

and  then  finally  Ill  do  that  for  this

path  as  well  so  Im  going  to  select  each

of  these  hold  shift  and  click  and  drag

over  each  and  then  combine  them

together  and  there  we  go  now  we  have

continuous  paths  for  each  segment  of

this  letter  so  at  this  point  in  the

tutorial  were  going  to  start

subtracting  areas  of  these  lines  and

adding  the  circles  to  the  ends  of  them

to  really  complete  this  look  here  so  let

me  come  back  into  here  and  well  get

started  on  this  uh  I  think  at  this  point

we  can  bring  the  opacity  of  these

objects  back  up  let  me  select  all  of

them  and  bring  the  opacity  back  up  to

100%  And  Im  going  to  start  off  with

this  segment  in  the  center  here  Im

going  to  select  that  and  grabb  my  nodes

tool  and  I  want  to  add  a  couple  of  nodes

in  an  area  where  Id  like  to  subtract

part  of  the  line  so  Im  going  to  double

click  right  here  to  add  a  new  node  and

lets  say  I  want  to  subtract  the  area  or

remove  the  line  segment  between  these

two  nodes  right  here  I  could  select  both

of  those  nodes  and  I  can  come  up  here  to

the  tool  settings  menu  and  select  this

option  that  says  delete  select  delete

segment  between  two  non-  endpoint  nodes

and  click  on  that  and  that  line  has  been

eliminated  so  Im  going  to  eliminate

another  part  of  this  line  down  here  Im

going  to  double  click  to  add  a  new  node

right  here  and  then  double  click  to  add

a  node  right  here  and  then  Ill  select

both  of  those  and  Ill  sub  Ill  uh

subtract  that  segment  as  well  and  now

what  we  can  do  is  we  can  put  the  circles

at  the  tips  of  those  lines  by  coming

over  here  to  the  stroke  style  Tab  and  if

you  notice  we  have  these  three  drop

downs  for  markers  Im  going  to  choose

this  drop  down  over  here  in  the  left

first  Im  going  to  choose  Im  going  to

click  on  that  Im  going  to  choose  this

rounded  marker  right  here  and  I  want  to

make  the  size  of  that  04  so  by  default

its  1.0  Im  going  to  remove  that  and

type  in4  and  press  enter  and  Im  going

to  close  out  of  that  and  I  want  to  apply

the  same  type  of  marker  to  the  end  point

so  Im  going  to  click  on  this  drop  down

and  instead  of  choosing  Circle  again  and

manually  typing  in  that  size  we  could

just  use  the  most  recently  applied

marker  so  Im  going  to  choose  this  one

right  up  here  in  the  top  of  this  list

and  now  we  have  it  applied  there  as  well

so  the  problem  at  this  point  is  that  we

have  the  circles  at  the  start  point  and

the  end  point  but  we  dont  have  them  on

these  middle  points  here  so  to  fix  that

Im  just  going  to  break  this  apart  Ill

come  up  here  and  go  to  path  and  Ill

select  break  apart  and  now  these  are

separate  segments  that  have  the  circles

at  the  start  point  and  the  end  point  of

each

line  so  now  lets  do  the  same  thing  down

here  with  this  other  segment  this  time

Im  going  to  put  the  line  braks  on  the

opposite  side  so  instead  of  putting  the

line  break  right  here  where  it  looks

kind  of  symmetrical  Im  going  to  make  it

look  a  little  little  more  Whimsical  than

that  so  Ill  put  it  over  here  Im  going

to  grab  my  nodes  tool  Ill  double  click

to  add  a  point  right  here  and  then  Ill

add  another  point  right  here  and  then

Im  going  to  select  those  and  delete  the

segment  between  between  them  and  then

Ill  put  another  one  down  here  Ill

double  click  this  one  and  then  put

another  one  right  there  and  Ill  delete

that  segment  out  of  there  and  now  we  can

just  go  to  our  markers  drop  down  and

choose  our  previously  used  marker  for

each  the  uh  for  both  the  start  and  the

end  point  and  now  we  can  break  this

apart  by  going  to  path  and

selecting  break

apart  and  there  we  go  that  segment  is

done  now  when  Im  creating  these  letters

what  I  like  to  do  is  I  like  to  leave  the

center  line  in  place  I  dont  like  to

break  them  apart  and  add  those  nodes  on

there  because  then  it  starts  to  look

less  like  a  letter  Ive  noticed  that

leaving  that  line  like  it  is  helps

preserve  its  appearance  as  a  letter

especially  if  you  zoom  out  more  so  let

me  Zoom  back  in  and  finally  Ill  do  this

outer  line  here  so  for  this  outer  line

Im  going  to  put  the  line  brakes  at

opposite  sides  of  this  one  here  in  the

center  so  instead  of  putting  the  line

brake  right  here  Ill  put  it  over  here

so  let  me  go  back  to  my  nodes  tool  Ill

click  double  click  to  add  a  node  where  I

want  the  line  brakes  to  be  select  both

of  them

delete  the  segment  and  then  Ill  come

down  here  and  do  the  same  thing  Ill

maybe  choose  this  part  right  here  and

then  Ill  just  delete  the  segment

between  these  two  nodes  let  me  try  that

again  and  then  Ill  delete  that  out  of

there  and  again  once  again  we  could  just

choose  the  same  markers  for  the  start

and  end

point  and  then  break  it  apart  by  going

to  path  and  selecting  break

apart  and  what  I  like  to  do  is  for  this

Center  Line  here  Im  just  going  to  grab

my  nodes  tool  and  Im  going  to  select

these  two  nodes  and  Im  just  going  to

drag  this  down  a  little  bit  personally  I

think  this  just  looks  a  little  better

when  this  Center  Line  descends  down  a

little  further  than  those  other  two

lines  right  there  and  as  you  can  see

were  finished  with  the  letter  now  if

you  want  to  change  the  color  and  style

of  your  letter  you  could  just  select

over  all  of  it  and  change  the  stroke

color  so  Ill  come  over  here  to  the

stroke  paint  Tab  and  Ill  choose  a  new

color  for  my  stroke  that  Ive  created

and  there  we  go  now  we  have  a  blue  sort

of  line  like  that  now  one  thing  to  keep

in  mind  is  because  we  have  this  setting

disabled  if  you  go  to  scale  this  object

up  like  that  the  lines  are  going  to

appear  thinner  and  the  same  thing  if  you

scale  it  down  if  you  scale  it  down  the

lines  are  going  to  appear  thicker  like

that  if  you  want  to  preserve  the  object

so  that  it  scales  the  line  the  line

weight  stays  the  same  regardless  of  how

much  you  scale  it  just  enable  this

setting  again  and  now  youll  be  able  to

scale  your  object  however  youd  like

without  losing  any  of  those  proportions

and  now  you  can  repeat  that  process

using  these  objects  over  here  you  could

take  these  lines  and  use  them  to  create

every  other  letter  of  the  alphabet  and

Ill  put  a  quick  little  graphic  up  on

the  screen  here  just  to  show  you  how  I

went  about  creating  all  of  the

individual  letters  of  the  alphabet  if

you  want  to  use  that  for

inspiration  and  that  should  do  it  for

this  tutorial  as  always  thanks  for

then  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions
