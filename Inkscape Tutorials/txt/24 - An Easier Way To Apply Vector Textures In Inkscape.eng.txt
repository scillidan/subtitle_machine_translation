in  a  previous  tutorial  from  a  few  years

ago  we  went  over  how  you  can  apply

Vector  Textures  in  inkscape  by  using

path  operations  as  it  turns  out  though

there  is  a  more  efficient  way  to

accomplish  this  using  a  relatively  new

feature  in  inkscape  known  as  inverse

masking  and  Id  like  to  share  that  with

you  in  this  tutorial

so  to  get  us  started  here  the  object  I

will  be  working  with  is  this  text  object

here  that  was  previously  a  text  object

but  I  converted  it  to  a  path  now  its

important  to  understand  that  what  were

going  to  do  in  this  lesson  only  works  on

objects  that  are  vector  pads  so  if

youre  working  with  a  text  object  or  a

shape  that  youve  drawn  with  the  shape

tool  youll  have  to  convert  it  to  a  path

first  by  selecting  it  and  going  to  path

and  selecting  object  to  path  and  once

you  do  that  youll  be  good  to  go  so  what

Im  going  to  do  now  is  import  my  Vector

texture  Im  going  to open  my  folder  and

Im  going  to  grab  the  SVG  file  and  just

click  and  drag  that  onto  the  canvas  if

you  want  to  follow  along  with  what  Im

doing  here  Ill  put  a  link  in  the

description  to  where  you  can  download

these  textures

and  once  its  imported  Im  just  going  to

scale  it  down  and  size  it  up  and

position  it  where  I  would  like  it  to  be

relative  to  the  subject  that  Ill  be

applying  it  to  so  Im  going  to  move  this

on  top  of  it  like  that

now  normally  what  we  would  do  is  we

would  select  both  of  these  objects  and

do  a  path  difference  but  the  problem

with  using  an  object  like  a  texture  to

do  something  like  that  is  that  this

texture  consists  of  thousands  of  nodes

maybe  even  tens  of  thousands  of  nodes

and  if  you  perform  path  operations  with

it  its  going  to  slow  down  your  computer

a  lot  so  its  a  really  inefficient  way

of  doing  things  instead  what  were  going

to  do  is  with  both  objects  selected  we

will  go  to  object

mask  and  were  going  to  choose  set

inverse  mask

and  once  you  do  that  its  going  to  apply

the  texture  to  the  object  as  you  can  see

there  and  if  I  zoom  in  all  the  way  you

can  see  that  the  vector  element  has  been

preserved  in  fact  all  of  that  texture  in

there  is  negative  space  if  I  were  to

grab  my  rectangle  tool  and  draw  a

rectangle  and  position  that  beneath

everything

you  can  see  those  negative  you  can  see

the  black  background  showing  through

those  negative  space  areas  like  that

now  if  at  any  point  you  want  to  remove

the  texture  the  good  thing  about  this

instead  of  using  path  operations  is  that

its  also  non-destructive  so  you  can

undo  this  at  any  point  you  could  just

select  the  object  and  go  to  object  and

go  to  mask  and  choose  release  mask

foreign

point  you  have  your  preserved  text

object  and  the  vector  texture  as  it  was

previously  so  that  is  a  much  more

efficient  way  of  applying  Vector

textures  to  objects  using  inkscape  if

you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  17  one  time  and  youre  in  for

Life  Ill  have  some  information  about

that  down  below  if  you  want  to  check

that  out  as  always  thanks  for  watching

thank  you
