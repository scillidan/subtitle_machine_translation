this  is  nick  with  logos  by  nick.com  and

in  this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  add  some  simple  shading  to

your  vector  illustrations

using  inkscape  this  is  a  nice  little

touch  you  can  add  to  your  designs  to

make  them  pop  a  little  more

and  if  you  dont  have  an  example  design

to  try  this  out  with  then  ill  have  a

download  link  in  the  description  of  the

video

if  you  want  to  practice  on  this  example

design  that  im  using  here

but  before  we  get  started  if  youd  like

to  learn  more  about  inkscape  be  sure  to

check  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  ill  have  a

link  in  the  description

of  the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that

out  so  getting  started  here  on  escape  as

you  can  see  i  have  the  software  open  the

first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  just  make

sure  we  have  our  snapping  enabled

up  here  the  top  icon  in  the  very  top

left  that  says

enable  snapping  make  sure  thats  turned

on  we  want  to  come  over  here  to  where  it

says

snap  to  custom  nodes  make  sure  thats

enabled  and  then  snap  to

smooth  nodes  as  well  and  what  im  going

to  do  now  is  im  going  to  import  this

example  design  i  have  it  downloaded  here

in  this  folder

im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  this

onto  the  canvas  like  that  im  going  to

click  ok  to  leave  the  default  settings

as  they  are

and  theres  this  example  shark  design

that  im  going  to  be  working  with

now  let  me  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

view  make  sure  you  have  custom  selected

go  to  zoom  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

and  now  im  just  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

shift  with  the  select  tool  here  hold

ctrl  and  shift  and  grab  one  of  these

arrows

and  scale  this  down  now  for  this

tutorial  you  dont  have  to  necessarily

follow  this  step

what  im  going  to  do  is  im  just  going

to  right  click  this  and  go  to  duplicate

and  im  going  to  apply  this  to  a

duplicate  copy  over  here

im  going  to  leave  this  one  over  here

the  original  so  that  i  can  show  you  the

difference

between  the  finished  design  and  how  it

was  previously  just  to  show  you  how  well

it  makes  the  design  look

so  i  have  this  design  over  here  what  i

want  to  do  now  is  just

ungroup  this  im  going to  come  up  here

to  where  it  says  ungroup  ungroup

selected  objects  click  on  that

you  may  want  to  click  on  that  just  a  few

times  just  to  make  sure  that  theres  not

several  layers  of  groupings  there  and

now  we  can  click  off  and  deselect

everything  what  im  looking  at  here

is  im  just  going  to  imagine  a  light

source  being  over  here  on  the  canvas

right  here

shining  light  going  this  way  so  like  on

this  side  of  the  design

the  right  side  will  be  like  a  glow  or

like  a  highlight  effect

and  over  here  will  be  a  shading  or  a

shadow  effect

so  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  by  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel

and  if  you  want  to  move  the  page  around

at  any  point  you  can  just  press  down  the

mouse  wheel  and  move  the  mouse

what  im  going  to  do  is  im  just  going

to  manually  draw  a  shaded  a  shaded  area

right  here  im  going  to  grab  the  bezier

pen  which  is  right  here  with  the

snapping  enabled  as  it  is  there  im  just

going  to  snap  to  this  cusp  node  right

there

click  and  then  come  down  here  and  click

down  here  into  this  blue  area

and  then  im  going  to  bring  the  line

going  through  this  blue  area  here

back  to  the  starting  point  oops

back  to  the  starting  point  like  that

make  sure  youre  going  through  the  dark

blue  area  the  whole  time

and  now  i  want  to  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  which  is  over  here  fill  in

stroke

or  you  can  press  ctrl  shift  and  f  on  the

keyboard  and  for  the  fill  color

i  want  to  make  this  the  same  shade  of

blue  that  this  light  shade  of  blue  is

here  only

slightly  darker  so  to  do  this  im

actually  going  to  use  the  dropper  tool

first  im  going to  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  pick  colors  from  an  image

or  you  could  press  d

on  the  keyboard  and  just  go  ahead  and

grab  a  sample  selection

from  that  there  and  where  it  says  fill

in  the  fill  tab

im  looking  for  hsl  and  in  the  l

row  im  going  to  take  this  and  bring

this  to  the  left  a  little  bit  just  to

make  that  a  little  darker

and  im  actually  going  to  change  the

shade  of  that  blue  a  little  bit  im

going  to  take  this

im  going  to  take  this  atro  and  just

slide  this  though  right  a  little  bit

just  to  make  that  pop  out  a  little  more

and  i  want  to  get  rid  of  that  black

outline  so  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  this  red  x  in  the  bottom  left

corner

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  grab  the

select  tool  and  i  want  to  lower  this

beneath  these  blue  objects  so  im  going

to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

lower  selection  one  step  click  that  once

again

again  and  again  until  it  goes  beneath

these  objects  over  here

now  instead  of  using  this  button  what  i

like  to  do  is  use  the  keyboard  shortcut

which  is

page  down  so  im  just  going  to  press

page  down  until  it  goes  beneath

everything  like  that

or  maybe  not  that  far  okay  perfect  right

there  once  youve  done  that

just  take  your  your  edit  pads  by  nodes

tool  and  take  this  line  and  just

manually  click  and  drag  it  in

so  that  it  follows  a  similar  contour  to

this  blue  this  dark  blue  line  right  here

and  if  you  go  to  the  select  one  you  zoom

back  out  youll  notice  youve  weve

added  a  little  bit  of  shading  right

there

now  im  going  to  take  this  and  make  this

a  little  lighter  i  dont  want  it  quite

that  dark  that  looks  a  little  better

and  im  going  to  go  through  and  do  the

same  thing  right  here  im  going  to  add

another  shape

by  the  fin  right  here  let  me  grab  the

bezier  pen

im  going  to  start  right  here  bring  the

line  right  here

then  over  here  and  then  through  the  blue

areas  the  dark  blue  out

the  dark  blue  areas  until  its  back  to

the  starting  point  like  that

fill  it  in  with  this  shade  right  here  so

im  going  to  grab  the  dropper  fill  that

in

get  rid  of  the  black  outline  by  shift

clicking  the  x

back  to  the  select  tool  and  again  im

using  page  down  until  it  goes  beneath

those  dark  blue  areas  and  now  im  going

to  grab  the  edit  paths  by

nose  tool  and  then  just  adjust  this  so

that  these  lines  follow  the  contour  of

these  lines  over  here

and  that  right  there  is  what  im  looking

for  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  thats

looking  pretty  good

so  now  im  going  to  draw  another  one

right  here  im  going  to  be  im  going  to

use  the  keyboard  shortcuts  now  and  work

a  little  bit  faster  so  im  going to  grab

the  bezier  pen

again  over  here  b  on  the  keyboard  to

grab  that  im  going  to  start  right  here

at  this  corner

bring  the  line  up  here  like  that  and

then  through

the  dark  blue  area

back  to  the  starting  point  press  d  on

the  keyboard  to  grab  the  dropper

make  that  the  same  color  get  rid  of  the

outline  by  shift-clicking  the  red  x

and  now  im  going  to  grab  the  edit  paths

by  nodes  tool  by  pressing

n  on  the  keyboard  and  ill  just  take

this  and  drag  this  in

you  know  what  let  me  go  back  to  the

select  tool  and  lower  this  down  im

going  to  press  page  down  on  the  keyboard

a  few  times  there  we  go

and  now  i  can  go  back  to  the  nodes  tool

and  i  can  click  on  this  node  right  here

the  corner  node

and  then  i  can  get  these  little  handles

thatll  make  it  easier  for  me  to  adjust

so  i  want  to  adjust  these  handles  so

that  this  shadow  is  following  the

contour

of  the  shoulder  here  or  the  dark  blue

border

thats  looking  pretty  good  right  there

as  you  can  see

im  gonna  do  the  same  thing  down  here

only  im  gonna  make  this  shadow

follow  this  this  side  right  here  so  let

me  grab  the  bezier  pen  again

same  steps  as  before  im  going  to  end

this  one  right  about  here  im  not  going

to  take  this  all  the  way  to  the  end

right  here  ill  put  it  right  about  here

back  through  the  starting  point  through

the  dark  blue  areas

there  we  go  make  it  the  same  color  get

rid  of  the  outline  lower  it  down

with  page  down  and  then  back  to  the

nodes  tool

and  we  can  adjust  this  further  and  make

it  fit

make  it  a little  more  fluid  now  you  may

want  to  temporarily

disable  snapping  while  youre  doing  this

to  do  that  you  can  just  come  up  here

and  click  on  that  because  theres

sometimes  youre  going  to  want  to  adjust

these  handles

and  the  snapping  gets  in  the  way  so  you

can  temporarily  turn  that  off  if  you

want  to  adjust  these  handles

like  im  doing  here  and  then  if  you  want

to  turn  it  back  on  you  could  just  press

you  can  just  click  this  button  or  what  i

like  to  do  is  use  the  keyboard  shortcut

which  is

shift  and  five  and  there  we  go  now  its

enabled  again

so  looking  at  this  illustration  here

were  going  to  want  to  apply

this  shadow  effect  maybe

maybe  over  here  where  the  thumb  is  and

then  after  that

well  have  the  shadows  applied  to  the

left  side  of  the  design

and  then  were  going  to  work  on  adding

highlights  to  the  right  side  of  the

design  so  let  me  just  go  through  and

finish  up  the  shadows  really  quick

okay  so  ive  gone  through  and  ive  added

some  shadows  to  the  left  side  of  the

design  now  im  going  to  add  some

highlights  to  the  right  side  of  the

design  and  im  going  to  start  up  here

with  the  sharks  head  up  here  because  as

were  imagining  this  light  source  is

coming  over  here  from  the  right  and

shining  this  way  so

let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen  again  let  me

turn  snapping  back  on  and  i  want  to  snap

to  this  corner

im  going  to  create  the  shot  the

highlight  right  here  going  along  the  top

of  the  head  here

snap  it  back  to  the  starting  point  over

here

bring  it  through  the  border  the  dark

blue  border

whoops  didnt  mean  to  do  that

and  back  to  the  starting  point

and  for  this  one  im  going  to  use  a

lighter  shade  instead  of  a  darker  shade

so  let  me  grab  the  dropper

make  this  the  same  shade  of  blue  only

im  going  to  make  this  one  a  little

lighter

like  that  lets  get  rid  of  the  outline

or  the  stroke  go  back  to  the  select  tool

page  down  a  few  times  to  lower  it

beneath  the  eye

and  beneath  the  dark  blue  area  now  we

can  grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool

im  going  to  turn  off  snapping  for  this

part  because  i  know  for  a  fact  that  its

going  to  get  in  the  way

take  this  node  down  here  adjust  this

thats  looking  pretty  good  i  just  want

to  get  this  out  of  the  way  of  the  eye

right  here  so  im  going  to  double  click

im  actually  going  to  double  click  right

here  to  add  a  new  node

and  then  just  bring  that  up  like  that

that  didnt  come  out

quite  as  well  as  id  like  so  let  me  undo

that  to  undo  im  just  going  to  hit  ctrl

z  a  couple  of  times

and  let  me  raise  this  back  to  the  top  i

want  to  add  this  node  right  here

there  we  go  and  now  i  can  go  ahead  and

lower  this  down

thats  what  im  looking  for  right  there

thats  looking  pretty  good  so  im  going

to  add  another  highlight  going  right

here

now  since  this  area  is  white  im  just

going  to  use  a  more  vibrant  shade  of

light  blue  for  this  highlight  although

its  technically

technically  if  this  were  like  gray  you

would  use  white  right  here  but  since

this  is  already  white  im  just  going  to

use  a  different

like  a  more  vibrant  blue  like  this  so

let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen  again

im  going  to  start  over  here  im

actually  going  to  start  up  here  let  me

turn  snapping  back  im  going  to  start  at

this  corner

and  ill  come  through  here  like  this

let  me  turn  off  snapping  after  ive

connected  to  that  point

there  we  go  back  through  this  area  right

here

and  i  want  to  make  this  probably  the

same  shade  of  this  maybe  a  little

lighter  so  let  me  grab  the  dropper

there  we  go  get  rid  of  the  outline  lets

lower  this  down

there  we  go  grab  the  nodes  tool  and  then

just  make  this  follow  the  contour  of

that

i  actually  got  to  lower  that  down  some

more  thats  still  sticking  out

there  we  go  and  i  want  to  make  that  a

little  lighter  thats  a  little  too  dark

for  a  little  too  dark  for  it  to  be  a

highlight  like  that  that  looks  pretty

good  right  there

so  now  im  going  to  create  another  one

going  through  the  teeth  right  here  let

me  grab  the  bezier  pen

right  through  there  and  then  right

through  here  like  this

back  to  the  starting  point  make  this  the

same  color  with  the  dropper  tool

get  rid  of  the  stroke  and  then  lower  it

down

like  that  and  as  you  can  see  its  its

really  coming  to  life  here  so  what  im

going to  do  is  im  going  to  add  a  few

more  highlights  through  here

maybe  right  here  on  the  right  side  of

the  shoulder  and  then  over  here  at  the

top  of  the  knuckles  over  here  and  maybe

right  there  as  well  ill  have  to  see  how

it  looks  so  let  me  go  through  and  do

that  real  quick

okay  so  as  you  can  see  i  finished  up

adding  my  highlights

to  the  right  side  and  the  top  side  of

the  areas  of  the  design  here  and  whether

or  not  this  is  actually  correct  like

this  is

how  the  light  would  actually  interact

with  the  subject  like  this

i  dont  know  probably  not  but  it  still

looks  good  enough  for  it  to  be  effective

and  to  make  the  design  pop  a  little  more

let  me  zoom  back  out  here

to  show  you  what  i  mean  im  going  to

take  this  original  design  and  im  going

to  put  it  right  next  to  it

and  as  you  can  see  there  is  a  clear

difference  there  this  design  just  seems

more  alive  it  seems  to  pop  a  little  more

it  just  looks  like  a

like  a  higher  quality  illustration  just

with  some  simple

shading  and  highlights  drawn  with  the

bezier  pen  like  that

so  that  is  how  you  can  go  about  adding

some  highlights  and  shadows  and

shading  features  to  your  simple

illustrations  using  inkscape
