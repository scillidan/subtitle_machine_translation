in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  divide  your  artwork  up  into

individual  Carousel  slides  and  then

export  them  as  individual  PNG  or  jpeg

images  using  inkscape  so  Ill  go  ahead

and  get  started  here  in  inkscape  the

example  well  be  working  with  for  this

demonstration  is  the  Instagram  Carousel

slide  which  they  recommend  a  size  of

1080  by  1350  so  what  Im  going  to  do  is

grab  the  rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  and  I

want  to  make  this  to  be  1080  width  by

1350  height  so  I  will  grab  my  selection

tool  Ill  come  up  here  to  where  the

width  and  height  inputs  are  and  Ill

change  the  width  to  well  first  of  all

make  sure  youre  working  with  pixels

here  and  then  make  sure  this  lock  icon

is  turned  off  and  I  will  make  this  a

width  of  1080.

and  then  I  will  make  this  a  height  of

1350.

and  now  we  have  the  size  this  represents

one  slide  on  the  carousel  so  if  you  want

to  have  three  or  four  slides  were  going

to  have  to  create  three  or  four  copies

of  this  and  stack  them  next  to  each

other  so  let  me  first  change  the

documents  so  that  its  the  size  of  this

rectangle  here  so  with  the  rectangle

selected  Im  just  going  to  press  Ctrl

shift  r  on  the  keyboard  or  if  youre

using  Mac  it  would  be  command  shift  R

and  its  going  to  resize  the  document  to

the  selection  as  you  can  see  there  and

now  we  want  to  get  rid  of  that  border

and  the  shadow  around  the  border  so  let

me  go  to  document  properties  Ill  go  to

file

document  properties

and  where  it  says  border  lets  first

turn  off  the  Border  shadow

and  then  we  will  turn  off  the  Border

altogether

and  then  we  can  close  out  of  this  menu

so  we  now  have  a  single  document  for  a

single  tile  so  what  we  have  to  do  is

create  three  or  four  duplicate  copies  of

this  for  the  for  this  demonstration  I

will  create  three  slides  if  you  want  to

create  more  you  can  go  ahead  and  do  that

first  Im  going  to  turn  on  snapping  up

here  in  this  top  right  corner  and  then

Im  going  to  snap  this  rectangle  to  the

right  hand  side  of  the  page  there  like

that  and  then  I  will  grab  the  documents

tool  down  here

I  will  snap  to  the  bottom  right  corner

then  click  and  drag  and  then  snap  to  the

top  left  corner  to  draw  the  second  page

and  if  I  move  this  over  we  now  have  a

second  document  there  now  it  looks  like

one  continuous  document  but  these  are

two  separate  two  separate  documents  here

we  have  page  one  and  then  page  two

so  now  Im  going  to  create  my  third

slide  Im  going  to  snap  this  over  here

to  the  right  hand  side

and  I  will  grab  my  documents  tool  again

snap  to  the  bottom  right  corner

click  and  drag

there  we  go  theres  page  three  so  let  me

grab  this  and  move  this  out  of  the  way

Im  just  going  to  work  with  three  slides

for  this  demonstration  so  Im  going  to

delete  this  rectangle  now  if  you  want

four  or  five  slides  youll  just  have  to

repeat  that  process  a  few  more  times  but

we  now  have  the  template  that  we  can  use

to  design  our  independent  slides  and  Im

gonna  for  this  demonstration  Im  gonna

bring  in  an  image  that  Ive  downloaded

from  a  stock  photo  site  let  me  just  open

this  up  I  have  this  on  my  other  screen

over  here  Im  going  to  click  and  drag

the  image  onto  my  canvas  like  that

okay  so  now  I  have  imported  my  artwork

onto  the  canvas  the  problem  that  we  have

now  is  that  you  cant  see  exactly  where

the  artwork  lines  up  with  the  canvas  so

were  going  to  re-enable  borders  so  that

we  can  see  that  let  me  place  this  on  top

of  the  top  of  the  document  like  that  and

then  I  will  open  up  the  document

properties  menu  again  file  document

properties

and  now

Im  going  to  turn  the  Border  back  on

Im  going  to  make  it  so  that  the  border

is  always  on  top  Im  going  to  tick  that

box  and  now  you  will  see  the  border  on

top  of  your  artwork  and  Im  going  to

leave  show  shadow  turned  off  thats  not

necessary  and  depending  on  the

composition  of  your  image  you  may  want

to  change  the  color  of  your  border  if

you  notice  here  my  border  is  kind  of

blending  in  with  the  image  it  doesnt

stand  out  very  well  so  Im  going  to  make

this  border  white  so  Im  going  to  change

the  Border  color  up  here

then  Im  going  to  make  this  white

and  you  can  see  you  can  see  that  border

much  better  now

and  if  you  want  to  bring  down  the

opacity  of  it  so  it  isnt  so  sharp  you

could  bring  this  down  a  little  bit  and

now  it  gives  you  a  better  idea  of  what

the  continuous  image  will  look  like

because  the  Border  isnt  so  prominent

there  so  let  me  close  out  of  that  now

and  we  now  have  our  document  set  up  with

three  different  Carousel  slides  that  we

can  add  our  contents  to  so  Im  going  to

resize  my  image  to  fit  this  better  Im

going  to  turn  off  snapping  now  we  dont

need  that  anymore

and  Im  going  to  hold  Ctrl  while  Im

scaling  and  Im  going  to  place  my

artwork  right  about  where  I  want  the

three  slides  to  be  so  in  this  first

slide  I  want  the  subject  to  be  in  here

and  then  the  last  two  slides  I  can  let

it  be  the  rest  of  the  image  like  that

and  what  you  could  do  now  is  you  can  go

through  here  and  add  some  contents  so  I

think  for  this  demonstration  Ill  just

add  some  simple  little  dummy  text  and

then  well  take  it  from  there

okay  so  I  have  some  sample  text  in  there

if  you  want  to  make  sure  that  your

elements  that  your  design  elements  are

aligning  perfectly  with  each  individual

slide  of  the  carousel  just  open  up  your

aligned  distribute  menu  by  going  to

object  and  selecting  align  and

distribute  down  here  at  the  bottom  of

the  list

and  then  set  the  relative  to  set  this  to

page  and  now  whichever  page  you  have  the

design  element  placed  over  you  can

Center  and  align  it  based  on  that

particular  page  there  so  Ill  make  a

duplicate  of  that  by  pressing  Ctrl  D  and

Ill  move  this  over  here

and  then  I  will  Center  this  up  on  this

page  as  well

okay  so  lets  say  that  this  is  the

design  I  want  to  export  these  are  the

three  slides  I  want  to  work  with  here

to  do  this  were  going  to  create

separate  images  of  each  tile  here  using

the  batch  export  feature  so  lets  go  up

to  where  it  says  file  and  go  to  export

and  then  over  here  in  the  export  menu

were  going  to  choose  batch  export

because  we  want  to  export  all  three  of

these  slides  at  once

and  were  going  to  choose  pages  over

here  and  if  you  notice  over  here  this  is

a  preview  of  whats  going  to  get

exported  we  have  page  one  page  two  and

Page  Three  now  if  yours  is  not  in  order

dont  worry  sometimes  it  just  indexes

them  here  in  the  wrong  order  but  they

will  be  exported  with  the  proper  name

and  the  and  in  the  proper  order  so  uh

this  this  title  page  one  page  two  page

three  down  here  you  can  choose  like  a

prefix  for  the  name

what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

click  this  little  folder  icon  over  here

to  choose  where  I  would  like  to  export

these  designs

so  what  you  can  do  here  is  change  the

name  of  the  files  that  will  be  exported

the  default  here  as  you  can  see  is

bitmap.png  if  I  leave  the  default  here

as  it  is  the  files  are  going  to  be  saved

with  the  names  bitmap  Dash  page1.png  and

then  page2.png  and  so  on  and  so  forth

Im  just  going  to  leave  that  as  it  is

down  here  you  can  choose  your  file  type

if  youd  like  the  default  is  PNG  but  if

you  want  to  export  as  JPEG  or  Tiff  or

webp  there  you  go  there  that  option  is

and  Im  going  to  click  save  and  what

Ill  do  here  is  I  will  just  put  up  on

the  screen  here  the  result  of  exporting

these  three  documents  as  individual

Carousel  slides  and  you  can  now  upload

these  to  Instagram  or  wherever  else  to

have  three  separate  images  that  make  one

continuous  image  so  thats  how  you  can

divide  your  artwork  up  into  individual

Carousel  slides  using  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  for  me
