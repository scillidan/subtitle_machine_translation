in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  create  this  mountain  range  logo

with  the  winding  River  using  nothing  but

simple  shapes  in  inkscape  I  should

mention  though  that  this  tutorial  is

going  to  be  more  of  an  intermediate  to

Advanced  tutorial  and  that  Im  not  going

to  be  going  over  every  single  step  in

excruciating  detail  so  if  youre  Vaguely

Familiar  with  how  the  tools  work  in

inkscape  then  you  should  be  able  to

follow  along  with  this  tutorial

otherwise  sit  back  and  enjoy  what

inkscape  can  do



so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

lets  start  out  by  making  sure  we  are

working  with  a  similar  layout  by  coming

up  here  to  where  it  says  View  and  having

WID  screen  disabled  now  for  some  reason

I  think  some  of  the  newer  versions  of

inkscape  automatically  start  out  in

widescreen  mode  so  if  you  have  that

enabled  just  go  ahead  and  disable  that

and  your  layout  should  look  the  same  as

mine  here  on  the  screen  so  the  first

thing  Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to

create  the  shape  or  the  emblem  for  the

logo  and  Im  going  to  use  the  stars  and

polygons  tool  for  that  Im  going  to  use

the  polygon  setting  with  all  of  these

input  values  here  and  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  upward  with  my  mouse  on  the

canvas  while  holding  control  and  shift

so  I  can  get  a  six-sided  shape  like  that

where  the  points  go  vertically  up  and

down  as  you  can  see  there  let  me  make

that  a  little

larger  okay  Im  going  to  grab  my

selection  tool  move  this  up  towards  the

center  of  the  page  a  little  more  and  Im

going  to  convert  this  to  a  path  by  going

to  path  object  to  path  and  then  Im

going  to  grab  the  edit  paths  by  nodes

tool  and  I  want  to  take  these  two  nodes

right  here  and  Im  going  to  enable  the

transformation  handles  and  Im  just

going  to  scale  these  nodes  down  a  little

bit  like

that  okay  then  Im  going  to  take  these

nodes  over  here  and  Im  going  to  scale

these  down  like  that  Im  holding  control

and  shift  while  I  do  this  to  lock  the

the  uh  aspect  ratio  and  then  Im  going

to  move  these  nodes  up  like  that  and  now

were  starting  to  get  the  shape  of  our

emblem  I  may  even  pull  this  out  a  little

bit  you  may  have  to  tweak  this  a  little

bit  just  to  get  it  how  you  like  it  that

right  there  is  about  what  Im  going  for

so  Im  going  to  leave  it  as  it  is

Im  going  to  turn  off  my  transformation

handles  and  then  grab  the  selection  tool

and  let  me  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  which  is  located  over  here  and  I

will  bring  down  the  opacity  of  this  a

little  bit  so  I  could  see  through  the

object  as  Im  working  with  it  so  what  I

want  to  do  now  is  round  off  the  corners

here  and  to  make  these  Corners  rounded

Im  going  to  use  a  path  effect  for  that

so  Ill  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

path  choose  path  effects  click  the  plus

icon  down  here  to  add  new  path  effect

and  the  path  effect  I  am  looking  for  is

Corners  so  Im  just  going  to  type  in

corners  and  there  it  is  the  corners  path

effect  Im  going  to  grab  the  nodes  tool

Im  going  to  click  and  drag  over  all  of

the  nodes  right  here  and  Im  going  to

pull  down  one  of  these  green  handles  to

make  these  Corners  rounded  and  you  cant

really  see  it  happening  as  it  happens

probably  not  on  my  screen  but  if  you  see

on  your  screen  there  should  be  a  blue

outline  indicating  the  degree  to  which

the  corners  are  being  rounded  right

there  and  if  you  release  the  click  you

could  see  now  we  have  some  rounded

Corners  there  which  is  what  Im  going

for  now  I  want  this  top  half  of  the  the

design  to  be  completely  rounded  so  what

Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  deselect

these  nodes  and  Im  going  to  take  just

this  node  right  here  oops  click  the

wrong  thing  Im  going  to  take  just  this

node  right  here  and  Im  going  to  bring

this  all  the  way  down  like  that  so  we

end  up  with  something  like  that  right

there  and  now  I  will  finalize  this  by

going  to  path  object  to  path  press  one

to  zoom  back  out  to

100%  and  maybe  even  let  me  just  make

this  a  little  a  little  uh  add  a  little

more  vertical  height  to  it  like  that

this  is  just  a  personal  preference  Im

just  eyeballing  this  as  I  go  along  okay

thats  looking  good  right  there  so  now

Im  going  to  create  some  Mountains  for

the  background  here  to  create  the

mountains  Im  going  to  use  the  squares

and  rectangles  tool  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  Im  going  to  hold  control  and

shift  while  clicking  and  dragging  to

create  a  perfectly  symmetrical  square

like  that  and  I  want  to  give  this

rounded  Corners  a  little  bit  Im  going

to  make  these  Corners  a  little  rounded

like  that  not  much  just  a  little  bit  and

then  I  will  grab  the  selection  tool  and

rotate  this  around  like  that  Im  going

to  hold  control  while  rotating  so  we  get

it  nice  and  vertical  like  that  and  Im

going  to  give  this  a  different  color

just  so  I  could  differentiate  it  up

against  the  emblem  over  here  Im  going

to  duplicate  this  a  few  times  to  make

some  mountains  in  the  background  so  Im

going  to  press  control  D  to  duplicate

Ill  put  this  one  up  here  control

duplicate  again  put  this  one  down  here

and  then  another  copy  over  here  and

thats  about  what  Im  going  for  right

there  so  Im  going  to  shift  click  all  of

these  so  I  have  them  all

selected  and  I  will  unify  them  all  Al

together  by  going  to  path

Union  and  now  Im  going  to  take  a

duplicate  of  the  emblem  here  Im  going

to  select  the  emblem  control  D  to

duplicate  it  hold  shift  click  on  this

shape  and  were  going  to  take  the

intersecting  area  here  by  going  to  path

and  selecting

intersection  and  now  Im  going  to  add  a

little  bit  of  a  uh  a  shadow  effect  to

the  corners  of  these  mountains  here  let

me  grab  the  pen  tool  let  me  enable

snapping  and  then  Im  going  to  snap  to

this  corner  right  here  to  create  a  point

Im  going  to  hold  control  and  bring  this

line  Im  going  to  bring  this  line  down

to  the  right  to  make  sure  its  parallel

with  this  line  right  here  this  angle  of

this  mountain  Im  going  to  bring  it  the

opposite  way  like  that  then  click  and

Ill  bring  this  one  up  here  Im  letting

go  of  control  at  this  point  Ill  bring

this  one  up  here  click  again  and  then

back  to  the  starting

point  okay  so  I  had  a  little  technical

difficulty  there  I  had  to  redo  that  one

okay  let  me  grab  a  duplicate  of  this

copy  now  contrl  D  put  this  over  here  put

this  one  over  here

and  there  we  go  now  I  want  to  shift

click  all  of  these  to  select  them  unify

them  together  path  Union  and  then

subtract  them  from  the  mountains  hold

shift  click  on  the  mountains  path

difference  and  there  we  go  that  right

there  is  the  effect  Im  going  for  okay

so  now  Im  going  to  create  Im  going  to

create  a  little  winding  River  to  place

right  here  in  the  Forefront  of  the  uh

design  here  so  let  me  turn  off  snapping

first  let  me  grab  the  pen  tool  and  for

this  were  going  to  get  a  little

creative  Im  going  to  create  just  one

vertical  line  like  this  Im  going  to

click  once  to  create  a  point  hold

control  put  this  line  down  here  like

that  click  again  and  press  enter  and

grab  the  nodes  tool  and  give  this  line  a

little  bit  of  a  curve  Im  going  to

select  these  handles  over  here  and  curve

this  out  like

that  there  we  go  grab  the  selection  tool

and  duplicate  this  and  I  want  to

position  this  in  such  a  way  that  the

space  between  the  two  lines  represents

the  shape  kind  of  like  a  winding  River

now  were  going  to  change  the

perspective  of  this  to  make  it  look  like

its  actually  part  of  the  landscape  here

but  for  now  were  just  trying  to  get

this  this  shape  right  here  between  these

two  lines  and  once  you  have  that  shape

like  that  select  both  of  them  convert

these  Strokes  to  a  path  path  stroke  to

path  and  then  unify  them  together  go  to

path  Union  and  now  break  them  apart  by

going  to  path  break  apart  and  now  if  I

click  off  of  that  to  deselect  it  you  can

see  this  has  been  broken  up  into

separate  pieces  and  I  want  this  piece

over  here  Im  G  to  press  delete  on  the

keyboard  to  get  rid  of  that  and  were

looking  for  this  piece  right  here  this

is  what  we  want  to  work  with  so  let  me

go  back  to  my  fill  and  stroke  menu  and

bring  down  the  opacity  of  this  a  little

bit  so  I  can  see  it  better  Im  going  to

place  this  over  here  and  now  Im  just

going  to  use  the  transformation  handles

to  uh  scale  and  Shear  this  as  needed  Im

just  going  to  make  this  shorter  like

that  maybe  even  scale  this

up  like  that  there  we

go  maybe  even  make  this  a  little  wider

so  that  it  stretches  out  more  across  the

design  okay  that  looks

good  and  if  you  really  want  to  sell  this

effect  you  can  use  the  perspective  path

effects  so  let  me  come  over  here  to  the

path  effects  menu  let  me  add  A  New  Path

effect  and  for  this  one  Im  looking  for

perspective  envelope  so  Im  going  to

type  in  PR  RS  and  there  it  is

perspective  and  now  down  here  where  it

says  type  make  sure  you  have  perspective

enabled  and  Im  going  to  enable  this  one

right  here  that  says  mirror  movements

and  vertical  and  now  I  can  grab  the

nodes  tool  and  I  should  be  able  to  take

these  two  right  here  and  bring  this  up

like  that  and  as  you  can  see  were

changing  the  perspective  of  this  River

here  to  make  it  look  like  its  uh

disappearing  into  the  vantage  point

there  now  Im  going  to  convert  that  to  a

path  by  going  to  path  object  to  path

make  that  a  little  bit  bigger  so  that  it

stretches  Out  Among  the  bottom  of  the

design

here  and  now  I  will  fit  that  into  the

emblem  I  may  even  make  this  a  little  bit

whoops  I  may  even  make  this  a  little  bit

um  wider  like  that  I  want  the  start  of

this  to  be  closer  to  this  corner  right

here  so  that  looks  good  as  it  is  Im

going  to  leave  that  Im  going  to  take

this  emblem  shape  right  here  control  D

to  duplicate  it  shift  click  the  river

and  go  to  path  intersection  and  there  we

go  now  we  have  that  right  there  okay  so

lets  create  a  little  pine  tree  to  put

right  here  in  the  Forefront  of  the

design  to  do  that  Im  going  to  grab  the

squares  and  rectangles  tool  I  want  to

make  make  sure  I  have  sharp

Corners  click  and  drag  to  create  a

square  like  that  convert  it  to  a  path

again  make  sure  you  have  sharp  Corners

here  path  object  to  path  grab  the  nodes

tool  Im  going  to  delete  this  node  right

here  by  pressing  delete  on  the  keyboard

and  then  Ill  take  these  nodes  over  here

and  Ill  make  those  Corners  sharp  like

that  and  now  I  can  grab  the  selection

tool  and  rotate  this  back  around  while

holding  control  so  we  lock  it  onto  15°

angles  like  that  we  want  this  nice  and

flat  and  upright  and  Im  just  going  to

make  this  a  little  narrower  Ill

duplicate  that  bring  this  one  down  here

make  this  one  a  little

bigger  and  then  Ill  duplicate  that  and

Ill  bring  this  one  down  here  and  make

that  one  a  little  bigger  like  that  I

should  probably  be  using  darker  colors

so  you  can  see  this  better  let  me  go

with  blue  there  we

go  and  there  we  go  I  think  that  right

there  looks  good  so  Im  going  to  use

that  as  it  is  Im  going  to  select  all  of

those  path  Union  and  there  we  go  theres

our  tree  so  let  me  scale  this  down  and

place  this  at  the  front  of  the  design

over

here  I  may  even  place

this  I  think  right  about  here  would  be

good  I  want  this  to  be  I  want  the  tip  of

this  tree  to  go  to  the  the  edge  of  the

river  right  here  whoops  what  happened

okay  there  we

go  Im  going  to  place  that  right  about

there  okay  thats  good  enough  so  let  me

duplicate  the  emblem  and  take  the

intersecting  area  there

intersection  and  let  me  give  this  thing

some  color  so  we  could  start

differentiating  the  elements  here  let  me

select  everything  we  can  now  bring  the

opacity  up  and  start  adding  in  some

color  so  I  want  the  mountain  range  here

to  be  a  dark  shade  of  blue  actually  Im

want  to  start  with  the  background  here  I

want  the  background  to  be  a  light  shade

of  blue  Im  going  to  start  with  uh  that

shade  right  there  maybe  that  and  then

Ill  take  this  and  Ill  make  this  a  dark

blue  like  that  and  I  want  the  tree  to  be

that  same  dark  shade  of  blue  so  Im

going  to  grab  the  dropper  tool  which  is

located  over  here  I  just  like  to  use  the

letter  d  on  the  keyboard  D  for  dropper

its  easy  to  remember  and  there  you  go

and  S  for  selection  back  to  the

selection  tool  grab  the  uh  the  river

here  Im  going  to  make  this  the  same

color  as  this  right  here  D  for  the

dropper  s  for  selection  there  we  go  and

now  Im  going  to  place  us  a  sun  a  little

bit  of  uh  sunrays  in  the  background  here

so  let  me  grab  these  circles  and

ellipses  tool  click  and  drag  to  create  a

perfectly  round  circle  like  that  place

it  in  the  center  of  the  design  Im  going

to  make  this  white  so  we  can  see  it

better  and  thats  actually  the  color  Im

going  to  use  for  the  Sun  so  let  me

Center  this  up  Im  going  to  shift  click

both  of  these  open  up  the  aligned

distribute  menu  which  is  over  here  we

can  press  control  shift  and  to  access

that  and  from  the  relative  two  I  want

last  selected  chosen  Im  just  going  to

Center  that  up  on  the  vertical  axis  like

that  now  let  me  make  this  a  little  bit

bigger  and  Im  going  to  lower  this  down

beneath  the  mountains  now  you  can  lower

you  can  raise  and  lower  objects  using

these  buttons  I  just  like  to  use  the

page  up  and  page  down  keys  on  the

keyboard  so  Im  going  to  press  page  down

to  lower  that  there  we  go  and  now  Im

going  to  make  a  duplicate  copy  of  this

Im  going  to  press  controll  D  Im  going

to  make  this  one

bigger  there  here  we  go  and  Im  going  to

make  this  one  a  lighter  shade  of  blue

again  pressing  D  on  the  keyboard  to  grab

the  dropper  grab  the  uh  fill  and  stroke

menu  make  this  one  a  lot  lighter  oops

and  then  Ill  just  take  this  and  page

down  and  lower  it  beneath  like  that  and

Ill  maybe  even  make  that  one  a  little

darker  okay  there  we  go  now  Im  going  to

duplicate  this  circle  again  controll  D

Ill  make  this  one  a  little

darker  maybe  even  add  a  little  more  blue

into  it  like  that  and  Ill  make  this

larger  and  Im  going  to  lower  this  down

by  pressing  page  the  the  page  down  key

like

that  there  we  go  Im  going  to  make  this

about  this  big  and  then  Ill  make  this

one  about  this

big  and  at  this  point  were  just  trying

to  size  things  up  to  make  sure  it  fits

nicely  and  then  Im  going  to  make  this

emblem  I  want  this  to  be  a  darker  shade

of  blue  than  this  so  let  me  press  D  on

the  keyboard  to  grab  the  dropper  and

Ill  make  this  one  a  little  darker

okay  that  looks  better  now  Im  going  to

update  the  river  color  to  match  this

shade  of  blue  right  here  so  let  me  just

grab  the  dropper  and  do  that  and  now  Im

going  to  take  the  intersecting  area  of

this  circle  right  here  so  let  me  grab

the  emblem  and  duplicate  that  shift

click  the  circle  path

intersection  there  we  go  and  as  you  can

see  the  design  is  coming  together  here

the  one  final  last  step  would  be  to  add

a  little  bit  of  a  white  border  going

around  the  outside  and  a  drop  shadow

beneath  it  so  it  really  pops  off  the

page  so  to  do  that  let  me  select  just

the  emblem  right  here  and  go  to  path  and

choose  uh  linked

offset  and  I  want  to  make  this  offset  a

totally  different  color  so  we  can  see  it

better  Im  going  to  choose  red  Im  going

to  grab  the  node  tool  and  there  should

be  this  little  node  up  top  over  here  and

you  should  be  able  to  grab  this  and  pull

this  out  like  that  and  I  want  the  border

of  this  emblem  to  be  about  about  that

big  I  can  finalize  that  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  and  then  I  will  make  that

white  grab  the  selection  tool  and  now

Im  going  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing

control  D  and  Im  going  to  make  this  one

black  and  now  I  can  use  my  page  down  key

to  lower  that  down  and  then  I  can  use  my

arrow  keys  to  bring  this  down  a  little

bit  there  we  go  Ill  give  that  a  blur

and  Ill  bring  down  the  opacity  of  that

blur  like  that  and  now  Ill  have  to

deselect  it  and  select  it  again  and  now

I  can  use  my  arrow  keys  to  move  that

down  a  little  bit  just  to  give  a  little

bit  of

offset  okay  there  we  go  and  I  think  that

should  do  it  for  this  lesson  that  is  how

you  can  go  about  creating  a  mountain

range  logo  with  a  winding  River  and  a

pine  tree  and  a  rising  sun  coming  up

beneath  it  inside  of  this  element  using

nothing  but  simple  shapes  in  inkscape

before  I  end  this  video  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  Demon  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  $17  one  time  and  youre  in  for

Life  Ill  have  some  information  about

that  in  the  description  of  the  video  if

you  want  to  check  that  out  as  always
