this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  lesson  well  be  going  over  how  you

can  create  multi-page  documents  using

inkscape  now  in  order  to  follow  along

with  this  lesson  youll  need  to  update

to  version  1.2  which  was  just  released

yesterday  because  this  is  a  new  feature

to  inkscape  if  you  remember  a  couple  of

years  ago  i  made  a  tutorial

demonstrating  how  to  design  pdf  reports

and  ebooks  and  various  types  of

multi-page  documents  but  because

inkscape  didnt  have  the  ability  to  do

this  at  the  time  we  had  to  save  each

page  as  an  individual  pdf  and  then  merge

them  together  using  a  third-party

application

but  thanks  to  version  1.2  those  days  are

over  so  lets  get  started  here  and

demonstrate  how  this  works  so  when  you

open  up  inkscape  version  1.2  this  should

be  your  view  when  you  first  open  a  new

document  this  white  square  right  here  or

rectangle  rather  represents  your  page

now  if  you  notice  down  here  at  the

bottom  of  the  tools  menu  youll  see  you

have  a  new  tool  here  called  the  create

and  edit  document  pages  tool  if  you

click  on  that  itll  activate  nodes  on

your  page  right  here  and  you  can  take

these  nodes  and  use  them  to  scale  them

and  change  the  size  of  your  document  and

you  could  even  move  your  document  around

the  workspace  like  this  if  you  need  to

do  that

now  what  you  can  also  do  with  this  tool

is  you  can  click  and  drag  like  this  to

create  another  page  like  that  and  now

you  have  two  different  pages  here

okay  now  if  you  want  to  create  an  exact

copy  of  a  page  you  already  have  what  you

can  do  is  you  can  click  on  one  of  those

pages  and  you  come  up  here  to  the  tools

menu  bar  at  the  top  of  the  screen  and

click  on  this  little  icon  right  here

that  says  create  a  new  page  and  when  you

click  on  that  its  going  to  create  a  new

page  in  the  same  dimensions  that  the

current  page  that  you  have  selected  is

so  this  new  page  is  the  same  size  as

this  page  over  here

now  if  you  look  over  here  through  this

drop  down  we  have  all  of  these  different

pre-made  templates  that  you  can  choose

from  if  you  want  to  change  the  size  of

your  page  to  something  specific  say  for

example  if  youre  designing  a  us  letter

8.5  by  11  inches  you  can  change  it  to

that  right  there  and  there  you  go  now

you  have  8.5  by  11  inch  document  and

then  again  you  could  change  this  using

these  nodes  at  any  time  just  as  you

would  with  the  original  page

okay  so  looking  up  through  these  uh  menu

items  right  here  lets  go  over  what  each

of  these  things  do  now  if  you  notice

over  here  as  i  click  on  these  different

pages  youll  see  up  here  they  are

ordered  one  through  three  this  is  page

one  of  three

this  is  page  two  of  three  and  this  is

page  three  of  three  this  represents  the

order  of  the  pages  so  if  i  were  to  save

this  as  a  pdf  document  this  would  be  the

first  page  this  would  be  the  second  page

and  this  would  be  the  third  page  if  i

want  to  change  their  order  at  any  point

all  i  have  to  do  is  select  one  of  them

and  then  on  either  side  of  the  order

right  here  we  have  this  one  that  says

move  page  backwards

and  now  that  will  be  page  two  of  three

even  though  nothing  visibly  changes  on

the  canvas  if  i  were  to  save  this

document  this  would  be  page  one

this  would  be  page  two  and  then  this

would  be  page  three  so  let  me  go  ahead

and  undo  that

so  now  this  is  one  this  is  two  and  this

is  three  and  then  up  here  we  have  names

you  can  name  each  page  if  you  want  this

is  really  just  for  personal  reference

this  isnt  going  to  change  the  name  of

your  document  or  anything  this  is  just

for  example  if  you  want  to  change  this

to

um  i  dont  know  like  something  like

brochure  contents

there  you  go

and  then  over  here  you  could  write  in

um

business  card

just  in  case  you  know  naming  your  pages

comes  in  handy  in  some  way  so  thats

what  that  does  and  if  you  want  to  delete

any  of  your  pages  what  you  could  do  is

you  can  select  on  it  like  that  click  on

it  with  the  tool  and  you  could  either

press  delete  on  your  keyboard

or  you  can  click  on  this  button  over

here  that  says  delete  the  selected  page

okay  so  let  me  go  ahead  and  undo  that

let  me  show  you  what  these  other  tools

in  here  do  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going  to  grab  the  stars  tool  and  create

a  star  right  on  top  of  this  page  right

here

now  if  i  go  back  to  the  pages  tool  if

you  notice  i  have  this  option  right  here

that  says  move  overlapping  objects  as

the  page  is  moved  this  means  that  if  i

move  the  page  the  object  will  move  with

it  so  if  i  move  this  page  youll  notice

the  object  is  fixed  in  place  its  not

moving  anywhere

thats  because  i  have  that  setting

turned  off  if  i  turn  that  setting  on  now

when  i  move  a  page  the  contents  of  the

page  will  be  moved  along  with  it  like

that  as  you  can  see  there

okay  so  thats  how  that  works  and  then

finally  over  here  we  have  fit  the  page

to  the  current  selection  or  the  drawing

so  if  i  have  an  object  selected  let  me

grab  my  selection  tool

if  i  have  an  object  selected  like  that

i  can  come  back  over  here  to  the  create

and  edit  document  pages  and  i  can  click

on  this  button  right  here  that  says  fit

the  pages  to  the  current  selection  of

the  drawing  if  i  click  on  that  you  see

what  happens  there  the  page  is  now  fit

to  the  size  of  that  document  right  there

or  that  object  right  there  so  thats  how

that  works

so  let  me  give  you  a  working

demonstration  of  how  you  can  save  a

multi-page  document  now  so  let  me  take

this  and  get  rid  of  this  im  going  to

grab  the  text  tool  im  just  going  to

this  is  just  for  an  example  here  you

dont  have  to  follow  along  with  what  im

doing  im  just  going  to  put  some  numbers

on  the  page

like  this  im  gonna  put  this  over  here

just  so  you  can  visualize  how  this  works

this  is  page  one  this  is  gonna  be  page

two  and  this  is  gonna  be  page  three  and

what  im  gonna  do  now  is  in  order  to

save  this  as  a  multi-page  document  im

gonna  go  to  file  and  im  gonna  go  to

save  as  and  i  want  to  choose  pdf  down

here

and  ill  click  save

leave  all  of  the  defaults  as  they  are

click  ok  and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is

im  going to  go  and  open  up  that  pdf

document  and  show  you  how  it  works

okay  so  as  you  can  see  here  ive  opened

up  my  multi-page  pdf  document  that  ive

created  thanks  to  inkscape  version  1.2

and  as  you  can  see  everything  is  in  its

order  this  was  page  one  this  was  page

two  and  this  was  page  three

so  that  is  how  you  can  create  multi-page

documents  using  inkscape  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class
