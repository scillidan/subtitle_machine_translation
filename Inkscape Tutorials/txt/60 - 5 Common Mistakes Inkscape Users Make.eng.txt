inkscape  is  a  large  application  with

lots  of  advanced

tools  and  features  as  a  new  user  you

have  a  lot  to  learn  and  youre  probably

going  to  make  some  mistakes  along  the

way

in  this  video  ill  be  going  over  some  of

the  more  common  mistakes  new  users  make

so  you  can  avoid  making  them  yourself



this  is  nick  with  logosbynick.com  and  in

this  video  ill  be  going  over  five  of

the  most  common  mistakes  users  make

when  theyre  new  to  inkscape  and  if

youd  like  to  learn  more  about  how

inkscape  works

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over  every  tool  and

feature  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out

that  being  said  lets  get  started

one  of  the  most  common  mistakes  i  see

new  users  making  is  trying  to  perform

path  operations  on  objects  that  arent

paths

in  short  path  operations  allow  you  to

take  multiple  objects  and  turn  them  into

new  objects

based  on  how  they  interact  with  each

other  you  can  unify  them

subtract  them  from  each  other  use  the

intersecting  area  to  create  a  new

object  and  more  however  this  only  works

on

individual  objects  that  are  paths  so  if

youre  trying  to  unify

groups  of  objects  for  example  its  not

going  to  work

youll  have  to  ungroup  the  objects  first

same  for  text  objects

and  rasterized  images  these  objects  are

not

paths  therefore  the  path  operations  will

have  no  effect  on  them

another  mistake  you  might  make  if  youre

new  to  inkscape  and  dont  know  any

better

is  neglecting  to  respect  the  power  of

the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

the  nodes  tool  allows  you  to  transform

all  of  the  individual  coordinate  points

of  a  vector  object

but  it  also  has  the  power  to  freeze  up

the  software

and  make  it  crash  if  you  try  to  select

objects  with  too  many  nodes

this  is  more  of  a  problem  with  inkscape

than  it  is  with  the  user  so  i  cant

really  blame  someone  for  walking  into

this  problem

but  it  is  something  you  need  to  be  aware

of  regardless  when  working  with  the

nodes  tool

always  be  careful  not  to  select  objects

that  are  really  complex

and  may  have  lots  of  nodes  if  possible

try  to  break  your  objects  apart  into

separate  objects  first

another  mistake  you  might  make  as  a  new

user  to  inkscape  is  forgetting  to

delegate

whether  or  not  you  want  the  strokes  on

your  object  to  scale

with  the  object  every  vector  object  has

two  properties

a  fill  color  and  a  stroke  that  acts  as

an  outline  around  your  object

and  the  stroke  has  its  own  size

independent  of  the  size  of  the  object

if  you  scale  down  your  object  you  may

notice  that  the  thickness  of  the  stroke

scales  down  with  it  if  youd  like  to

maintain  the  thickness  of  the  stroke

regardless  of  how  you  scale  your  object

though  you  can  find  the  setting  for  that

in  the  tool  settings  menu  for  the  select

tool  just  look  for  the  icon  that  says

when  scaling  objects  scale  the  stroke

width  by  the  same  proportion  when  you

hover  your  cursor  over  it

if  youd  like  your  strokes  to  scale

alongside  your  objects

leave  it  enabled  if  youd  like  to

maintain  a  fixed  size  for  your  strokes

regardless  of  scaling

simply  turn  it  off

next  up  on  our  list  of  common  mistakes

you  might  make  as  a  new  inkscape  user  is

forgetting  to  disable  snapping  when

youre  working

snapping  is  a  really  useful  feature  that

allows  you  to  draw  with  precision

for  example  lets  say  you  have  two  boxes

and  you  want  to  place  them

flush  against  each  other  doing  this

freehands  would  prove  difficult  because

it  would  be  nearly  impossible  for  you  to

know

exactly  where  the  edges  are  with

snapping  enabled  though

your  objects  will  snap  directly  against

each  other  once  theyre  in  close

proximity

as  useful  as  this  may  be  there  will  be

some  instances  where  youre  trying  to

create  something

but  the  snaps  keep  getting  in  the  way

and  drawing  your  cursor  away  from  where

you  actually  want  it  to  be

to  disable  snapping  just  click  the

enable  snapping  icon

in  the  top  left  portion  of  your  screen

or  what  i  like  to  do  is  just  press

shift  and  5  on  the  keyboard  as  a

shortcut

the  final  common  mistake  new  inkscape

users  make  has  to  do  with  exporting  png

images

exporting  allows  you  to  generate  usable

copies  of  your  designs  in  the  dot  png

format

this  is  useful  for  exporting  your  logo

for  use  on  a  website

generating  app  icons  graphics  for  a  game

so  on  and  so  forth

one  aspect  of  the  export  menu  that  many

users  overlook  though

is  the  export  area  section  this  is  what

allows  you  to  dictate

exactly  what  gets  exported  the  page

option  will  export  everything  inside  of

your  page  border

the  drawing  option  will  export

everything  inside  and  outside  of  your

page  border

the  selection  option  will  only  export  an

object  you  have  selected

and  the  custom  option  allows  you  to

manually  define  coordinate  points

on  the  x  and  y  axis  of  your  canvas  that

youd  like  to  export

where  a  lot  of  users  run  into  trouble  is

when  they  think  theyre  exporting  one

thing

but  theyre  really  exporting  something

else  because  the  proper  export  area

setting  hasnt  been  selected

this  is  why  its  important  to  always  pay

close  attention  to  the  settings

in  the  export  menu  and  that  should  do  it

for  todays  video

hopefully  these  pointers  will  make  your

learning  experience  a  little  easier

if  you  have  any  questions  or  need

clarification  on  anything  ive  gone  over
