and  demonstrate  how  they  work  Ill  put  a

link  in  the  description  of  the  video  if

you  want  to  check  that  out  so  Im  gonna

go  ahead  and  get  started  here  in

Inkscape  Im  gonna  open  up  a  blank

canvas  as  you  can  see  here  and  I  just

want  to  make  sure  that  were  all  working

with  a  similar  view  before  we  get

started  so  Im  just  gonna  come  up  here

to  where  it  says  view  make  sure  you  have

custom  selected  and  then  well  go  to

zoom  were  going  to  zoom  in  at  1  to  1

and  then  Ill  open  up  the  align  and

distribute  menu  with  this  button  over

here  and  then  I  will  open  up  the  Edit

objects  colors  gradients  and  Stroke  menu

with  this  button  right  here  and  where  it

says  online  and  distribute  youre  gonna

want  to  make  sure  you  have  last  selected

chosen  where  it  says  relative  too  and

once  weve  done  that  were  good  to  get

started  so  the  first  thing  were  going

to  create  is  the  actual  text  so  Im

gonna  grab  the  text  tool  over  here  and

Im  gonna  click  on  the  canvas  Im  gonna

use  all  caps  for  weather  right  now  Im

going  to  create  each  text  item  on  its

own  line  so  Im  gonna  write  how  for  the

first  line  second  line  to  create  and  for

this  third  line  vintage  just  like  I  had

in  the  thumbnail  of  the  video  how  to

create  vidiq  text  and  posters  each  on

its  own  line  and  what  Ill  do  now  is  let

me  grab  the  Select  tool  I  want  to  take

this  text  right  here  this  middle  word

vintage  if  you  saw  in  the  thumbnail  of

the  design  I  had  that  word  over  I  had  it

placed  on  top  of  like  a  banner  so  I  want

to  make  sure  I  use  a  different  font  for

this  for  this  word  right  here  Im  gonna

open  up  the  text  editor  Im  gonna  click

on  that  text  and  hold  ctrl  shift  T  to

open  up  the  text  editor  or  you  just

click  on  this  T  icon  up  here  I  like  to

use  control  shift  T  cuz  its  easier  and

B  is  a  zaba  Tanna  poster  Im  gonna  go

with  that  Ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  to  a  poster  I  have  all  of

the  fonts

and  textures  Im  gonna  be  using  in  this

tutorial  you  dont  necessarily  have  to

use  these  fonts  that  Im  using  you  can

use  whatever  fonts  youd  like  but  if  you

really  want  to  get  that  vintage  look

that  I  have  in  the  a  thumbnail  the  video

Id  recommend  downloading  and  installing

these  fonts  so  Im  going  to  apply  that  I

want  to  make  that  a  little  bigger  by

holding  ctrl  and  shift  and  clicking  and

dragging  to  scale  that  up  and  for  these

text  items  over  here

I  want  the  font  Im  going  to  use  for

that  is  ctrl  shift  T  Im  going  to  use

League  gothic  there  we  go  of  me  use  the

normal  regular  size  apply  that  let  me

make  that  a  little  bigger  ctrl  shift  and

scale  that  up  and  I  just  want  to  put

everything  near  each  other  over  here  let

me  click  and  drag  over  all  of  these  and

in  the  align  distribute  menu  Im  going

to  Center  them  on  the  vertical  axis  and

then  Ill  come  down  here  to  distribute

and  Im  going  to  click  on  make  vertical

gaps  between  objects  equal  so  let  me

click  off  of  that  to  deselect  everything

what  I  want  to  do  now  is  make  each  of

these  objects  the  same  width

except  for  this  middle  text  right  here

so  let  me  click  on  this  word  right  here

Im  going  to  turn  on  this  lock  icon

where  it  says  when  lock  changed  both  the

width  and  the  height  by  the  same

proportion  turn  that  on  Im  gonna  right

click  that  and  go  to  copy  and  then  when

I  click  on  this  top  word  up  here  and  go

to  edit  paste  size  paste  width  and  its

gonna  make  it  the  same  width  as  the  next

item  Ill  come  down  here  and  do  the  same

thing  edit  paste  size  paste  width  were

not  going  to  do  this  with  this  middle

word  here  because  this  word  needs  to  be

a  little  bigger  than  the  others  because

this  is  gonna  go  on  a  banner  and  itll

do  the  same  thing  down  here  edit  paste

size  paste  with  and  what  I  will  do  now

is  I  want  to  put  little  lines  between

these  two  text  items  right  here  so  Im

gonna  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  and  Ill  just  click  and  drag  to

create  a  little  rectangle  in  there  let

me  get  rid  of  that  stroke  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  the  X  I  want  to  make

that  black  I  grab  the  Select  tool  bring

that  down  a  little  bit  these  are  just

meant  to  be  little  access  little  accent

pieces  they  dont  have  to  you  dont  have

to  necessarily  use  these  but  I  think

they  make  the  design  just  come  together

a  little  more  and  again  I  want  to  make

these  I  want  to  make  these  the  same

width  so  Ill  go  to  edit

paste  size  paste  width  there  we  go  now

let  me  right  click  that  little  duplicate

bring  this  one  down  here  there  we  go  let

me  bring  these  all  a  little  closer  now

in  fact  I  want  to  take  this  middle  text

right  here  and  make  that  even  bigger

right  about  there

bring  these  a  little  closer  now  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  all  of

these  Im  gonna  do  the  same  thing  again

the  same  thing  again  Im  gonna  Center

them  on  the  vertical  axis  and  then

distribute  make  vertical  gaps  between

objects  in  equal  like  that  okay  now  Im

going  to  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  now  what  Im  gonna  do  is

were  gonna  work  on  creating  a  banner

for  this  word  vintage  right  here  so  let

me  take  these  objects  right  here  and

just  hold  ctrl  and  just  move  them  out  of

the  way  a  little  bit  and  Ill  take  these

objects  and  do  the  same  thing  hold  ctrl

move  it  up  out  of  the  way  and  now  Im

gonna  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  well  you  know  what  first  what  I

want  to  do  is  let  me  go  back  to  the

Select  tool  let  me  click  on  this  text

right  here  and  make  this  white  then  Ill

grab  the  squares  and  rectangles  tool  and

Im  gonna  create  a  rectangle  going  over

the  text  right  there  Im  gonna  make  that

black  grab  the  Select  tool  Im  gonna

send  that  to  the  bottom  by  clicking  the

button  that  says  lower  selection  to  the

bottom  or  what  I  like  to  do  is  just

press  end  on  the  keyboard  at  the  end  key

and  it  sends  it  to  the  bottom  thats

good  let  me  just  size  that  up  a  little

better  we  want  a  little  bit  of  padding

around  the  edges  not  too  much  though  and

then  Ill  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

word  and  just  make  sure  I  have  it

centered  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  let  me  click  on  that

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

now  Ill  take  just  this  object  right

here  just  this  rectangle  Ill  get  a  path

object  to  path  and  then  Im  gonna

right-click  it  and  go  to  duplicate  and

Im  gonna  make  this  red  and  Im  gonna

give  this  a  red  stroke  by  holding  shift

and  clicking  on  the  color  red  and  then  I

want  to  send  that  to  the  bottom  by

pressing  end  on  the  keyboard  and  the  red

stroke  I  want  to  make  that  a  little

thicker  Im  gonna  come  up  here  to  the

stroke  style  tab  but  Im  gonna  increase

the  size  of  that  a  little  bit  maybe  a

little  bit  more  there  we  go  thats

thats  a  good  thats  a  good  thickness

right  there  now  what  I  want  to  do  is

convert  this  to  a  path  so  Ill  go  to

path  stroke  the  path

and  then  paths  break  apart  and  then

paths  Union  and  the  whole  point  of  that

was  to  end  up  with  the  rectangle  just

like  this  black  one  here  only  slightly

thicker  on  all  on  both  dimensions  right

there  now  what  I  want  to  do  is  take  this

black  rectangle  and  duplicate  that  Im

gonna  click  on  it  then  press  control  D

on  the  keyboard  Im  trying  to  take  this

and  move  this  down  to  the  left  over  here

like  that  and  Im  gonna  send  that  to  the

bottom  by  pressing  end  on  the  keyboard

let  me  move  this  down  here  like  this  Im

gonna  grab  the  nodes  tool  click  and  drag

over  these  two  these  two  nodes  to  the

right  right  here  hold  ctrl  and  just

click  and  drag  these  over  to  the  left

like  that  this  is  gonna  be  like  the  tail

kind  of  like  the  tail  of  the  ribbon

right  about  there  is  good  now  Im  gonna

click  and  drag  over  those  nodes  right

there  and  I  want  to  insert  a  new  node  in

the  middle  so  well  come  up  here  to  the

very  top  left  where  it  says  insert  new

nodes  into  selected  segments  click  on

that  and  then  I  want  to  click  on  just

that  new  node  right  there  and  hold  ctrl

and  just  move  this  over  to  the  right  to

give  it  kind  of  like  a  little  bit  of  a

fish  tail  for  the  ends  there  may  be  a

little  less  thats  good  right  there  now

let  me  grab  the  Select  tool  again  let  me

duplicate  that  by  hitting  ctrl  D  on  the

keyboard  and  I  will  flip  that

horizontally  and  bring  this  over  here  to

the  top  right  and  I  want  to  send  this  to

the  bottom  as  well  Im  gonna  press  end

on  the  keyboard  I  want  to  bring  this

right  about  here  and  then  Ill  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  other  one  so  we

have  both  of  these  little  ribbon  tails

selected  and  Ill  go  to  path  Union  and

then  Ill  hold  shift  and  click  on  this

red  rectangle  right  here  and  Center  it

up  on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis

like  that  and  then  Ill  go  to  path

difference  and  there  you  have  our  ribbon

so  let  me  take  this  text  these  text

objects  right  here  and  just  hold  ctrl

and  move  them  up  a  little  bit  and  Ill

do  the  same  thing  with  these  Ill  click

and  drag  over  those  hold  ctrl  move  these

down  a  little  bit  like  that  and  thats

what  Im  looking  for  right  there  now

what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im  gonna  click  and

drag  over  everything  Im  gonna  group

them  together  by  clicking  the  button  up

here  that  says  group  selected  objects  or

you  could  just  press  ctrl  G  because  I

like  to  do  and

Im  going  to  share  it  a  little  bit  so

Im  gonna  click  on  this  object  again  if

you  notice  here  when  you  have  it

selected  you  have  these  arrows  right

here  these  are  the  scaling  handles  they

allow  you  to  scale  an  object  if  I  click

on  the  object  its  gonna  give  us  the

rotation  and  the  shearing  handles  which

will  allow  us  to  either  rotate  or  shear

the  object  I  want  this  shearing  handle

over  here  to  the  right  Im  just  gonna

click  and  drag  that  up  a  little  bit

maybe  about  that  much  right  there  thats

pretty  good  and  now  its  time  to  create

kind  of  like  a  frame  or  a  border  going

around  the  words  here  so  let  me  grab  the

squares  and  rectangles  tool  again  Im

gonna  click  and  drag  to  create  a

rectangle  going  over  all  of  those  words

I  want  to  make  this  I  want  to  give  this

a  black  outline  so  Im  gonna  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  color  black  and  I  want

it  to  have  no  fill  so  Im  gonna  click  on

this  red  X  to  get  rid  of  a  fill  color

and  I  want  to  make  that  border  a  little

thinner  I  dont  want  to  be  that  thick

Im  gonna  try  maybe  eight  eight  pixels

that  looks  pretty  good  okay  so  let  me  go

back  to  the  Select  tool  let  me  convert

that  to  a  path  by  going  to  path  object

to  path  and  then  I  want  to  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  text  objects  just  to

make  sure  we  have  it  centered  up  on  this

horizontal  and  vertical  axis  like  that

now  let  me  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  and  click  on  just  this

rectangle  right  here  Im  gonna  go  back

to  the  nodes  tool  the  edit  pads  by  nodes

click  and  drag  over  these  top  two  nodes

insert  a  new  node  in  there  and  do  the

same  thing  down  here  take  those  two

nodes  and  put  a  new  one  in  there  now

what  I  want  to  do  is  grab  just  those  two

nodes  right  there  click  and  drag  over

both  of  those  and  up  here  in  the  tool

settings  youre  gonna  see  show

transformation  handles  for  selected

nodes  if  I  turn  that  on  its  going  to

give  us  scaling  handles  for  the  nodes

that  we  have  selected  which  is  going  to

be  useful  here  which  is  what  I  want  Im

gonna  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  Im  gonna

grab  the  scaling  handle  up  here  and  you

just  pull  this  out  a  little  bit  if  you

notice  here  were  giving  the  top  and  the

bottom  a  little  bit  of  a  tip  like  that

now  Im  going  to  turn  off  the  scaling

handles  show  transformation  handles  for

selective  nodes  turn  that  back  off  so  it

doesnt  get  in  your  way  the  next  time

you  go  to  use  the  nodes  tool  later  on

Im  gonna  grab  the  select  tool  okay  that

right  there  is  looking  pretty  good

thats  about  what  Im  looking  for  now

what  I  want  to  do  is  put  another  border

around

outside  edge  of  this  border  only

slightly  thinner  so  what  Im  gonna  do  is

Im  gonna  duplicate  this  Im  going  to

press  control  D  on  the  keyboard  and  Im

gonna  fill  this  with  white  and  Im  gonna

give  this  a  white  outline  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  the  the  color  of

white  and  for  the  width  Ill  make  this

larger  Im  gonna  go  with  maybe  lets  say

twelve  see  how  that  looks

and  I  want  to  send  this  to  the  bottom

lower  select  objects  to  the  bottom

thats  going  to  act  this  white  border  is

gonna  act  as  a  buffer  between  the  large

black  border  and  the  smaller  black

border  so  let  me  duplicate  that  again

control  D  and  Ill  make  this  one  black

and  give  it  a  black  stroke  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  black  and  Ill

send  that  to  the  bottom  as  well  and  Im

gonna  want  to  make  this  one  a  little

better  a  little  bigger  Im  gonna  try  20

okay  so  thats  not  quite  what  Im

looking  for  let  me  zoom  in  a  little  bit

you  could  zoom  in  and  out  by  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel  Im

gonna  take  this  white  one  right  here  I

want  this  border  this  gap  between  the

two  borders  to  be  bigger  so  Im  gonna

make  this  one  maybe  16  maybe  15  and  then

Ill  take  the  other  at  the  outer  black

border  over  here  and  Ill  make  that  Im

gonna  make  this  a  little  bigger  than  25

looks  a  little  too  big

let  me  try  22  a  little  bigger  Im  just

going  to  manually  adjust  that  until  it

looks  about  right

that  right  there  is  about  what  Im

looking  for  I  think  that  looks  pretty

good  so  now  I  can  click  off  of

everything  I  want  to  zoom  in  and  take

just  this  outer  border  right  here  I  want

to  go  to  path  stroke  to  path  path  break

apart  path  Union  and  Im  gonna  do  the

same  thing  to  the  inner  white  border

right  there  path  stroke  the  path  path

break  apart  path  Union  and  then  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  outer  black

border  so  that  we  have  both  the  white

and  the  black  borders  selected  and  go  to

path  difference  now  Im  going  to  click

on  the  large  black  border  and  here  the

original  one  and  Im  going  to  convert

that  to  a  path  as  well  by  going  to  path

stroke  the  path  and  then  finally  Im

going  to  hold  shift  Im  gonna  click  on

the  other  border  so  we  have  both  of

these  borders  selected  and  go  to  path

Union  now  let  me  press  one  on  the

keyboard  to  zoom  back  out  to  100%  let  me

click  off  it  to  deselect  everything  its

looking  pretty  good  now  its  gonna  make

a  few  minor  edits  and  well  be  all

finished  so  let  me  click  on  the  text

objects  in  here  and  let  me  ungroup  them

by  clicking  the  button  that  says  ungroup

selected  objects  or  you  can  press  ctrl

shift  G  like  that  and  what  I  will  do  now

is  I  want  to  take  this  border  right  here

I  mean  that  this  border  this  black

rectangle  right  here  I  want  to  duplicate

that  by  pressing  control  D  and  I  want  to

make  that  red  and  I  want  to  bring  the

opacity  down  in  half  roughly  in  half

what  I  want  to  do  is  create  a  gap  in

these  borders  right  here  between  the

ribbon  and  the  borders  so  Im  gonna  use

this  red  rectangle  as  a  reference  point

for  that  so  let  me  grab  the  nodes  tool

again  Im  gonna  clicking  drag  over  this

top  node  then  Ill  hold  your  shift  click

and  drag  over  this  node  over  here  and

Im  gonna  hold  ctrl  and  click  and  drag

that  up  thats  what  about  there  that

looks  good

Ill  do  the  same  thing  down  here

clicking  drag  over  this  node  hold  shift

click  and  drag  over  that  node  and  then

hold  control  and  move  this  one  down  to

about  there  so  that  is  sticking  out  just

a  little  bit  further  than  the  black

ribbon  beneath  it  then  Ill  grab  the

Select  tool  hold  shift  click  on  your

border  right  there  and  go  to  path

difference  and  that  right  there  was  the

point  of  that  I  wanted  to  create  that

gap  between  the  poor  and  the  ribbon

right  there  so  the  next  step  is  I  want

to  add  a  little  bit  of  a  little  bit  of

an  accent  piece  right  here  in  the

corners  of  the  top  and  the  bottom  so  to

do  that  first  what  I  want  to  do  is

enable  snapping  Im  gonna  come  up  here

to  where  it  says  enable  snapping  turn

that  on  and  were  gonna  want  to  make

sure  we  have  this  one  selected  it  says

snap  custom  nodes  and  this  was  well  snap

snaps  smooth  nodes  and  Im  going  to  take

this  border  right  here  and  Im  gonna

duplicate  that  by  hitting  ctrl  D  on  the

keyboard  and  Im  gonna  make  this  red  and

Im  gonna  bring  the  opacity  down  in  half

now  its  gonna  click  and  drag  and  move

this  up  Im  gonna  snap  this  piece  Im

gonna  snap  the  bottom  corner  into  the

top  corner  of  the  original  one  right

there  and  I  want  to  take  this  red  area

what  thats  sticking  out  I  want  to  use

that  as  the  accent  piece  so  let  me  grab

the  Bezier  pen  which  is  over  here  or  you

could  press  B  on  the  keyboard

and  Im  gonna  start  a  line  going  right

here  in  the  middle  of  the  black  border

come  over  here  through  here  like  this

oops  we  go  through  here  then  here  then

back  to  the  starting  point

grab  the  Select  tool  hold  shift  on  the

keyboard  and  click  on  the  red  object  and

go  to  the  path  intersection  and  thats

what  Im  looking  for  right  there  now  I

want  to  duplicate  that  by  hitting  ctrl  D

I  want  to  flip  that  vertically  and  I

want  to  click  and  drag  this  down  here

and  then  snap  this  onto  there  like  that

now  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  again

Im  holding  ctrl  and  rolling  down  the

mouse  wheel  to  zoom  Im  gonna  hold  your

shift  click  on  that  red  object  so  we

have  both  red  objects  selected  and  then

Im  gonna  hold  shift  and  click  on  them

on  the  border  and  go  to  path  Union  and

now  Ill  go  to  path  break  apart  so  that

everything  is  an  individual  piece  now

and  the  whole  point  of  that  as  you  can

see  here  is  to  create  this  little  indent

just  a  nice  little  accent  piece  for  the

design  so  the  final  step  I  would  say

would  be  to  add  the  texture  but  first  I

want  to  add  a  little  bit  of  color  so  let

me  uh  first  let  me  click  and  drag  over

everything  and  go  to  path  object  to  path

and  thats  going  to  take  that  text  and

change  it  from  text  objects  to  actual

pads  that  we  can  work  with  now  I  want  to

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  I  want  to

take  just  this  word  vintage  right  here  I

want  to  ungroup  it  unify  it  together  by

going  to  path  Union  and  then  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  banner  underneath  it

and  go  to  path  difference  and  what  that

did  was  it  pretty  much  just  used  the

text  as  a  reference  to  punch  negative

space  punch  a  hole  through  the  ribbon

there  so  that  I  can  change  the  colors

and  do  whatever  I  want  to  it  and  as  you

can  see  its  kind  of  like  a  negative

space  between  there  in  those  words  so

now  that  Ive  done  that  I  want  to  give

this  thing  some  color  Im  gonna  click

and  drag  over  all  of  it  Im  gonna  give

this  like  a  little  royal  blue  or  like  a

dark  navy  blue  something  like  that

thats  pretty  good  I  want  to  take  this

word  I  actually  want  to  take  this  piece

right  here  and  make  this  a  shade  of  gold

obviously  you  can  color  this  and  however

youd  like  you  dont  have  to  use  the

colors  Im  using  here

Im  gonna  go  the  fill  tab  up  here  under

the  HSL  tab  Im  gonna  take  the

saturation  just  bring  that  down  a  little

bit  you  bring  this  up  a  little  bit  as

well  I  want  to  do  the  same  thing  I  want

to  hold  shift  and  click  on  both  the  word

text  and  this  accent  piece  right  here  I

want  to  grab  the  dropper  tool  and  make

that  the  same  color  as  this  there  we  go

and  I  want  to  take  let  me  grab  the  nodes

tool  Im  gonna  click  on  just  the  word

create  here  and  click  on  that  hold  shift

click  on  that  each  letter  individually

so  that  we  have  them  all  selected  go

back  to  the  Select  tool  and  then  grab

the  dropper  and  make  that  the  same  color

right  there  and  then  finally  I  want  to

take  the  outer  border  right  here  and  I

want  to  make  that  the  same  color  as  the

gold  so  let  me  select  those  both  grab

the  dropper  over  here  or  you  can  press  D

on  the  keyboard  thats  also  another  way

to  grab  it  grab  the  Select  tool  press  1

on  the  keyboard  to  zoom  back  out  to  100%

and  what  Im  going  to  do  now  is  just

click  and  drag  over  all  of  this  and

group  this  together  ctrl  G  to  group  it

together  let  me  turn  off  the  snapping

for  now  because  thats  just  gonna  get  in

our  way  the  final  step  is  to  add  a

little  bit  of  a  texture  on  here  to  make

it  look  worn  aged  and  again  Ill  have  a

link  in  the  description  of  the  video  to

a  to  a  page  with  all  of  the  resources

including  this  texture  what  Im  going  to

do  is  once  you  have  the  texture  hoping

Im  gonna  bring  my  folder  over  here  just

so  you  can  see  I  have  my  folder  over

here  Im  gonna  take  the  Im  gonna  take

the  texture  grunge  texture  dot  PNG  and

just  click  and  drag  it  into  Inkscape

like  that  and  just  leave  this  little

window  that  pops  up  just  leave  all  the

defaults  there  go  ahead  and  click  OK  and

there  you  have  the  texture  let  me  zoom

out  a  little  bit  so  you  can  see  this  let

me  bring  the  opacity  of  that  down

roughly  in  half  so  we  can  see  whats  on

there  as  well  so  what  I  want  to  do  is

place  this  texture  over  the  image  right

here  Im  gonna  hold  ctrl  +  shift  and

scale  this  down  a  little  bit  now  if  you

notice  where  the  black  areas  of  the

textures  are  like  this  is  the  black

scratch  marks  when  I  apply  this  texture

to  this  design  all  of  those  black

scratches  are  gonna  represent  negative

space  in  the  design  so  all  of  those

black  scratches  are  going  to  become

white  or  negative  space  within  that

design  youll  see  what  I  mean  when  I

apply  the

texture  so  Im  telling  you  that  so  you

can  you  could  try  to  figure  out  where

exactly  you  want  the  texture  to  be

because  like  if  you  take  this  area  right

here  which  is  all  black  and  place  it

over  here  its  gonna  punch  out  a  big

area  of  the  design  thats  not  going  to

be  legible  so  I  like  to  make  sure  I  not

Im  not  using  too  much  of  the  texture

over  the  design  maybe  something  subtle

like  that  now  Ill  click  and  drag  over

both  of  those  bring  the  opacity  all  the

way  up  and  go  to  object  mask  set  and

there  you  go  Id  say  that  looks  pretty

good  so  I  think  that  should  do  it  for

this  tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go

about  creating  a  vintage  style  text

poster  using  Inkscape  if  you  have  any

questions  let  me  know  and  as  always

thanks  for  watching
