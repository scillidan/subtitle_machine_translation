this  is  knit  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  your  own  custom  color

palettes  in  Inkscape  and  save  them  to

your  installation  so  that  you  can  load

them  up  and  work  with  them  at  any  point

in  the  future  if  youd  like  and  if  youd

like  to  learn  more  about  how  Inkscape

works  be  sure  to  check  out  my  Inkscape

masterclass  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  every  tool  in

future  in  Inkscape  and  I  explain  what  it

is  and  demonstrate  how  it  works  Ill

have  a  link  in  the  description  of  the

video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  so

to  get  us  started  here  as  you  can  see  I

have  Inkscape  opened  up  on  my  screen  and

if  you  look  down  here  to  the  bottom  of

the  page  youll  notice  we  have  this

color  palette  that  we  normally  work  with

an  Inkscape  and  if  you  click  this  little

arrow  icon  over  here  to  the  bottom  right

youll  get  this  little  flyout  menu  with

a  bunch  of  different  color  palettes  to

choose  from  now  by  default

Inkscape  has  the  Inkscape  default

palette  here  when  you  load  it  up  but  you

can  choose  from  any  of  these  other

options  here  like  for  example  if  you

click  on  greens  itll  give  you  a  wide

spectrum  of  green  shades  to  choose  from

and  coloring  your  objects  and  theres  a

whole  bunch  of  different  options  in  here

if  you  want  to  check  it  out  you  can  look

at  something  like  a  bun  sue  here  where

this  looks  as  if  its  the  Ubuntu

branding  colors  so  on  and  so  forth  now

what  you  can  do  is  you  can  actually

create  your  own  color  palette  and  add  it

to  this  list  using  the  technique  Im

going  to  show  you  in  this  tutorial  so

let  me  set  this  back  to  Inkscape  default

for  now

and  let  me  just  set  up  the  document  here

Im  gonna  go  to  file  document  properties

and  I  want  to  turn  off  the  visibility  of

the  page  border  for  now  so  where  it  says

show  page  border  just  deselect  that  for

now  and  Im  gonna  come  up  here  to  the

grids  tab  and  Im  going  to  add  a  new

rectangular  grid  click  on  new  and  where

it  says  spacing  X  and  space  and  Y  Im

going  to  change  each  of  those  to  100  so

that  theres  100  pixels  of  space  between

each  grid  line  close  out  of  that  were

gonna  go  to  view  zoom  zoom  in  at  1  to  1

so  that  we  have  a  100%  view  of  the

document  here  and  then  finally  Im  going

to  open  up  the  fill  and  Stroke  menu  with

this  button  up  here  or  you  can  press

control  shift  +  F  on  the  keyboard  so

what  Im  going  to  do  now  is  Im

basically  going  to  create  a  bunch  of

objects  and  color  them  all  in  with

whatever  shade

like  to  be  included  in  my  custom  color

palette  that  Im  gonna  load  up  in  here

so  Im  going  to  grab  the  squares  and

rectangles  tool  and  Im  going  to  create

a  square  within  these  grid  lines  and  Im

going  to  color  this  in  with  a  shade  that

I  would  like  to  save  maybe  something

like  that  and  Im  going  to  create

another  shade  I  would  like  to  save  maybe

something  like  that  then  create

something  else  maybe  something  like  that

thats  looking  pretty  good

and  were  going  to  do  is  Im  just  going

to  go  through  and  Im  gonna  create  a

bunch  of  different  objects  and  Im  gonna

color  them  all  in  with  colors  that  I

like  that  Id  like  to  save  to  my  custom

color  palette

okay  so  as  you  can  see  here  Ive  gone

through  and  Ive  created  a  bunch  of

different  squares  and  Ive  colored  them

in  with  colors  that  Id  like  to  save  to

my  palette  once  Im  finished  what  Im

going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  click  off  of

the  graphic  to  deselect  everything  and

then  Im  gonna  come  back  to  the  document

properties  by  going  to  file  document

properties  and  lets  come  back  over  to

the  page  tab  and  Im  going  to  turn  the

visibility  of  the  page  border  back  on

and  Im  gonna  come  over  here  to  where  it

says  resize  page  to  content  Im  going  to

expand  to  that  menu  and  Im  gonna  click

this  button  right  here  that  says  resize

page  to  drawing  or  selection  and  that  we

can  close  out  of  that  menu  and  thats

gonna  do  what  thats  gonna  do  is  its

gonna  make  the  document  size  fit  the

size  of  the  graphic  that  weve  created

here  and  all  Im  gonna  do  now  is  Im

just  gonna  save  this  Im  gonna  go  to

file  save  as  and  for  now  Im  just  gonna

save  this  to  my  desktop  Im  going  to

give  it  whatever  name  Id  like  the  name

of  the  color  palette  to  be  in  this  list

when  I  bring  it  up  so  Im  just  gonna  for

demonstration  purpose  isms  going  to  name

this  u2  palette  and  Im  actually  going

to  save  this  Im  not  going  to  save  this

as  an  SVG  file  Im  going  to  save  it  as  a

dot  GPL  file  or  a  palette  file  and

Im  gonna  go  ahead  and  click  Save  now

let  me  close  out  of  Inkscape  here  let  me

minimize  this  what  we  have  over  here  I

have  this  on  my  desktop  this  is  the  GPL

file  Im  going  to  open  up  a  window  Im

actually  gonna  open  up  a  folder  and  go

to  wherever  it  is  that  you  have  your

Inkscape  whatever  Drive  that  you  have

Inkscape  installed  on  for  most  of  you  is

probably  going  to  be  your  C  Drive  for  me

I  have  it  saved  on  my  e  Drive  so  Im

gonna  open  up  the  e  Drive

Im  gonna  look  for  Program  Files  Im

gonna  go  to  Inkscape  share  Inkscape  and

palettes  and  if  you  noticed  here  we  have

an  index  of  all  of  our  color  palettes

that  are  included  with  our  Inkscape

installation  so  Im  just  going  to  take

this  YouTube  palette  GPL  and  click  and

drag  this  into  the  folder  go  ahead  and

click  continue  to  give  it  permission  to

do  so  and  all  we  have  to  do  now  is

restart  Inkscape  so  let  me  come  back  up

here  let  me  close  out  of  Inkscape

and  let  me  just  load  it  back  up  make  it

fullscreen  there  we  go  and  lets  click

on  this  arrow  again  and  there  you  go

YouTube  padlet  the  GPL  if  you  click  on

that  there  is  our  custom  color  palette

based  on  those  colors  that  I  used  in

that  previous  document  you  can  now  color

this  in  however  you  would  like  so  I

think  that  should  do  it  for  todays

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

creating  your  own  custom  color  palettes

in  Inkscape  and  saving  them  so  that  you

can  work  with  them  in  the  future  if  you

have  any  questions  leave  a  comment  below

and  as  always  thanks  for  watching
