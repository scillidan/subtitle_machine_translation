this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  use  the  trace

bitmap  feature  located  in  inkscape  and

what  trace  bitmap  does  is  it  allows  you

to  create  a  vector  tracing  of  a

photograph

using  an  automated  algorithm  instead  of

having  to  trace  it  manually  using  the

bezier  pen  and  other  tools

okay  now  the  benefit  of  using  trace

bitmap  is  that  it  saves  you  a  lot  of

time  it  creates  a  really

quick  tracing  of  any  photograph  you  have

the  downside  of  using  it  though

is  that  it  doesnt  always  work  with

every  photo  based  on  the  composition  of

your  photo  sometimes  it  produces  some

sloppy  results  so

youre  never  going  to  get  a  100  accurate

tracing  of  your  photograph

unless  you  trace  it  manually  but  the

downside  of  tracing  it  manually  is  that

it  takes  a  lot  of  time  and  a  little  bit

of  expertise  as  well

so  the  method  you  should  use  depends  on

the  image  youre  working  with  and  what

it  is  youre  trying  to  achieve

if  youre  just  trying  to  create  a  quick

sloppy

automated  vector  tracing  of  your  photo

trace  bitmap  is  great  for  that  so  let  me

show  you  how  to  go  about  doing  that  i

have  these  two  example  photos  here

im  going  to  work  with  this  one  first

im  going  to  come  over  here  to  where  it

says

path  im  going  to  click  on  trace  bitmap

now  if  you  notice  up  here  we  have  three

different  tabs

trace  bitmap  pixel  art  and  help

for  this  tutorial  im  going  to  focus  on

trace  bitmap  pixel  art  would  be  a

separate  tutorial  altogether  so  lets

focus  on  trace  bitmap  for  now

if  you  notice  in  here  we  have  two

different  options  we  have  single  scan

and  we  have  multiple  scans

and  the  difference  between  the  two  of

them  basically  is  one  is  for  black  and

white

one  is  for  color  so  single  scan  would

create  a

single  vector  object  it  would  trace  a

single  vector  object  over  your  photo

in  one  single  color  so  it  would  be  good

for  creating  things  like  silhouettes

or  maybe  even  creating  vector  textures

whereas  multiple  scans  would  be  good  for

creating

uh  vector  tracings  of  photos  that  have  a

lot  of  color  and  you  want  to  retain  some

of  that  color  so  let  me  demonstrate  how

each  works  im  going  to  choose  single

scan  for  this  image  because  this  is  a

black  and  white  image

and  i  just  want  to  create  like  a  like  a

silhouette  sort  of  tracing  this

now  if  you  look  at  this  drop  down  over

here  we  have  a  lot  of  different  options

and  these

options  all  what  these  options  do  is

they  basically

trace  your  image  using  a  different

sort  of  algorithm  and  the  one  that  you

should  use  depends  on  the  composition  of

the  image  youre  working  with  because

every  image  is  different

okay  so  when  youre  tracing  a  bitmap

youre  going to  want  to  cycle  through

these  different  options

and  update  the  preview  to  see  how  it

looks  to  find  out  which  one  is  best  for

your  photo

so  for  this  one  im  just  going  to  leave

the  cut  the  brightness  cut  off  im  going

to  click  update

and  it  shows  you  a  preview  here  of  the

vector  tracing  thats  going  to  be  made

from  the  image

okay  that  looks  pretty  good  i  like  how

that  looks  im  going  to  click  ok  to

create  the  tracing

and  if  you  notice  it  created  a  vector

tracing

over  the  photo  now  this  here  is  a  true

vector  object  you  can  change  the  color

of  that

you  can  perform  path  operations  on  that

you  can  do  everything  that  you  would

normally  do  with  the  vector  object

with  this  right  here  let  me  turn  off

snapping  now  let  me  get  rid  of  that

let  me  show  you  some  of  these  other

options  here  just  to  show  you  what  i

mean  if  you  come  down  here  to  like

something  like  edge  detection  and  you

click  update  youll  notice

it  doesnt  really  trace  anything  in  the

image  theres  some  speckles

caught  in  the  uh  in  the  tracing  there

but  its  not  really  what  im  going  for

so  for  this  sort  of  image

edge  detection  wouldnt  be  good  but

maybe  for  a  different  type  of  image

edge  detection  would  work  perfectly  so

really  like  i  said  it  depends  on  the

image  youre  working  with  so  whenever

youre  trying  to  trace  vectors

using  this  tool  make  sure  to  cycle

through  these  and  see  which  one  gives

you  the  best  result

okay  see  this  right  here  as  an  example

if  i  click  ok

we  end  up  with  a  pretty  sloppy  tracing

this  tracing  right  here  its  also  got  a

lot  of  nodes  in  it  this  is  a  really

complicated  tracing  so

uh  one  thing  id  like  to  warn  you  about

when  using  this  tool  is  to  be  very

careful

about  making  complicated  tracings  like

this  now  my  computer  was  able  to  handle

this  because  i  have  a  pretty  powerful

computer  but  if  youre  using  like  your

your  average

consumer  grade  computer  this  would

probably  lock  up

inkscape  and  cause  you  to  have  to

restart  the  application  so

always  be  careful  when  youre  creating

traces  that  youre  not  creating

something  too  complicated

okay  so  let  me  show  you  now  if  you  go  to

uh  any  of  these  options

here  brightness  cutoff  you  have  some

settings  that  you  can  tweak  over  here

the  brightness  threshold  let  me  update

this

right  now  by  default  its  at  0.450  if  i

change  that  to  something  like  point

eight  and  click  update  it  you  can  see  it

changes

the  tracing  it  changes  the  algorithm  of

the  tracing  there  theres  more  of  the

shadows  being  caught  up  in  the  tracing

there

so  this  is  just  one  of  those  things  that

gives  you  more  granular  control  over

your  tracing

so  when  youre  tracing  an  image  just

cycle  through  these  different  settings

see  which  one  works  best  and  then  you

can  alter  these  settings  a  little  bit  to

see

to  really  fine-tune  your  tracing  now

this  looked  a  lot  better  before

at  0.45  so  im  going to  put  that  back  to

what  it  was  and  click  update

and  then  over  here  we  have  invert  image

if  you  click  on  that  and  you  click

update

you  can  see  it  creates  an  inverted

tracing  if  i  click  ok  to  create  that

tracing

it  pretty  much  creates  a  vector  tracing

of  the  negative  space

and  the  subject  it  creates  a  vector

tracing  of  the  negative  space  of  the

image

and  the  subject  becomes  the  negative

space  of  the  tracing  as  you  can  see

there

okay  so  thats  another  thing  you  might

want  to  pay  attention  to  whenever  youre

tracing  an  image  so  let  me  undo  that

let  me  show  you  now  how  to  trace  images

with  color  if  i  select  this  image  right

here

im  going  to  click  on  multiple  scans  now

because  im  working  with  color

and  again  we  have  all  of  these  different

options  we  can  cycle  through  im  going

to  choose  colors  for  this  one

im  going  to  click  update  and  its

showing  you  how  the  vector  tracing  would

look  in  color  im  going  to  click  ok  to

generate  that

and  as  you  can  see  here  let  me  zoom  in

on  this  if  you  zoom  out  it  looks

photorealistic  but  if  you  zoom  in  you

can  see  that  this  is  indeed  a  vector

tracing

and  now  the  flaws  in  using  auto  tracing

become  a  little  more  apparent  because

you  can  see  theres  a  lot  of

imperfections  in  here  theres  a  lot  of

speckling  and

a  lot  of  details  that  got  included  in

there  that  probably  shouldnt  have  been

but  like  i  said  with  an  auto  tracing  you

cant  expect  it  to  be  perfect  its  never

going  to  be

exact  okay  so  let  me  come  back  over  here

this  image  over  here  we  have  the  number

of  scans

scans  pretty  much  represent  the  number

of  colors

in  an  image  okay  so  with  this  tracing  i

created  eight  scans  meaning  its  gonna

use  eight  different  colors

okay  now  if  i  decrease  that  to  like

maybe  something  like  three

and  click  update  its  only  going  to  use

three  colors

okay  as  you  can  see  there  and  inversely

if  i  increase  it  from  eight  to  maybe

something  like  16

it  includes  more  of the  colors  and  if

you  click  ok

you  end  up  with  a  bigger  tracing  with  a

lot  of  different  options  but  at  the  same

time

it  looks  a  little  more  photorealistic

and  just  to  show  you  that  this  is  indeed

a  vector  tracing  im  going  to  ungroup

this  im  going to  go  to  object

ungroup  and  its  going  to  ungroup  it

into  lots  of  different  little  parts  here

and  you  could  zoom  in

and  you  could  take  these  parts  and

change  them  and  do  whatever  you  want

with  them

okay  then  finally  if  you  click  on  this

image  up  here  youll  notice  theres  a

remove  background  setting

now  if  you  enable  that  its  going  to

remove  the  white  background

from  this  image  here  the  problem  with

using  this  though  is  it  it  only  works  on

images

where  the  background  is  really  defined

this  image  is  a  great  example  because

the  background  is  white  so  if

the  software  will  have  no  problem

determining  where  the  background  is

located

on  more  complex  images  its  just  going

to  exclude  areas  of  the  image

that  it  thinks  is  the  background  even  if

its  not  exactly  accurate  so  let  me  just

show  you  how  that  looks  im  going  to

click

update  im  just  going  to  click  ok

and  it  created  a  vector  tracing  minus

the  background  im  going  to  place  it

over  this  object  here  so  you  can  see

okay  now  you  get  an  idea  ive  removed

the  background  now  some  of  it

some  of  it  got  wrong  like  you  see  here

theres  a  little  bit  of  negative  space

in  there  showing  through  the  image

beneath  it  is  showing  through  there  so

it  removes  some  of  that  as  well  but

thats  okay  because  thats  easy  to  fill

in

otherwise  but  thats  how  that  part  works

and  then  finally  down  here  we  have  some

settings  that  you  can  play  with  if

if  youve  cycled  through  these  options

and  youve  played  with  these

adjustments  and  you  still  cant  get  it

quite  right

you  can  adjust  these  as  well  we  down

here  we  have  speckles

this  says  ignore  small  spots  in  the  in

the  bitmap

the  idea  behind  this  is  that  it

eliminates  some  of  this

fragmentation  in  here  some  of  these

speckles  but  as  you  can  see  its  not

always  perfect

maybe  if  i  were  to  increase  this  a

little  bit  maybe  it  would  do  a  little

better  job  but  im  not  going  to  play

with  that  for  now

over  here  smooth  corners  thats  enabled

by  default  whenever  you  create  a  vector

tracing  at  something  usually

you  end  up  with  sharp  corners  in  your

image  they  end  up  smooth  when  you  trace

them

okay  so  uh  thats  enabled  by  default  and

then  over  here  optimize  try  to  optimize

paths  by  joining  a  paste

adjacent  bezier  curve  segments  the  idea

behind  that  is  that  whenever  you  create

a  vector  tracing  of  an  image

youre  creating  a  really  complex  uh

vector  object  with  a  lot  of  nodes  in  it

let  me  show  you  as  an  example  here  im

going to  trace  this  image  im  going  to

click  on  this

as  you  can  see  my  computer  is  struggling

with  this  a  little  bit  im  going  to

click  on  update

ill  click  ok  now  i  may  regret  trying

this  but  im  going to  give  it  a  try

anyway  im  going  to  select  this  vector

object  and  im  going  to  come  over  here

to  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

okay  now  if  you  notice  this  image  i  mean

this

this  vector  object  is  made  up  of

hundreds  maybe  even  thousands  of  little

nodes  here

okay  now  when  you  create  a  vector  object

with  lots  of  nodes  like  that

um  sometimes  itll  lock  up  your  computer

the  idea  behind  optimize  is  that  if  you

increase  this  threshold  itll  create

less  of  those  nodes

okay  so  thats  pretty  useful  in  creating

a  vector  tracing  that  you  can  actually

work  with  without  a  crash  in  your  system

but  the  downside  is  with  less  nodes  it

may  not  be  as  accurate  as  a  tracing

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

uh  creating  vector  tracings  of

photographs
