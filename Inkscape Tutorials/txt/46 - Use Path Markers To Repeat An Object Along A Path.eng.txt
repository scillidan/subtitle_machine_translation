this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  lesson  well  be  going  over  how  to

use  markers  in  inkscape  now  markers  are

useful  because  they  allow  you  to  take  a

single  object  and  repeat  it  along  a  path

without  deforming  the  object  in  previous

lessons  we  went  over  how  to  use  pattern

along  path  which  is  really  useful  for

creating  unique  designs  and  patterns  but

the  downside  of  using  this  tool  is  that

it  deforms  the  object  as  it  flows  along

the  path  here  and  theres  no  way  to  turn

this  feature  off  so  in  order  to  get  this

result  right  here  we  need  to  use  markers

so  lets  go  ahead  and  demonstrate  how  to

do  this  so  here  we  are  in  a  new  document

the  first  thing  im  going  to  do  is

create  the  path  that  id  like  the  object

to  flow  along  now  you  can  use  virtually

any  path  that  youd  like  for  this

demonstration  im  just  going  to  use  a

simple  circle  so  im  going  to  grab  the

circles  and  ellipses  tool  im  going  to

click  and  drag  and  hold  ctrl  to  create  a

nice  round  circle  with  the  aspect  ratio

locked  like  that

and  the  way  markers  work  in  inkscape  is

everywhere  that  theres  a  node  a  marker

will  be  placed  so  what  i  want  to  do

first  here  is  convert  this  circle  to  a

path  let  me  go  to  path  object  to  path

and  then  ill  go  to  the  edit  paths  by

nodes  tool  and  as  you  can  see  here  we

have  nodes  here  in  these  four  quadrants

of  this  shape  now  what  im  going  to  do

is  im  going  to  take  an  object  and  im

going  to  convert  it  to  a  marker  and  im

going  to  apply  the  marker  to  this  path

so  that  theres  going  to  be  the  object

at  each  of  these  four  points  right  here

so  let  me  actually  go  ahead  and  create

the  object  now  now  the  object  that  im

going  to  use  for  a  marker  is  just  a

simple  star  im  going  to  grab  the  stars

tool  and  im  going  to  draw  a  star  like

that

now  you  can  use  whatever  shape  youd

like  you  can  use  a  logo  you  can  use  an

icon  you  can  use  text  any  vector  object

youd  like  can  be  used  as  a  marker  so

let  me  turn  this  blue  just  so  we  have

some  differentiation  here

and  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going  to

convert  this  object  to  a  marker  now

before  you  convert  your  object  to  a

marker  if  youd  like  to  keep  a  copy  of

the  shape  on  hand  i  would  recommend

creating  a  duplicate  copy  of  it  because

once  we  convert  this  to  a  marker  the

shape  is  going  to  disappear  off  of  the

canvas  so  lets  say  you  want  to  keep

this  shape  im  going  to  right  click  this

and  go  to  duplicate  and  im  going  to

take  this  duplicate  copy  and  then  ill

go  to  object  and  i  will  select

objects  to  marker

and  now  its  going  to  disappear  off  the

canvas  like  that  so  let  me  grab  this

shape  right  here  i  want  to  apply  the

marker  to  this  shape  let  me  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  could  press  ctrl  shift

and  f  on  the  keyboard

and  im  going  to  remove  the  fill  and

stroke  fill  from  here  so  let  me  click

this  red  x  down  here  to  get  rid  of  the

fill  we  dont  want  any  fill  or  any

stroke  on  here  we  want  to  leave  this  as

an  invisible  shape  and  then  what  i  will

do  is  ill  come  over  here  to  the  stroke

style  tab  now  if  you  notice  we  have

these  three  input  boxes  right  here  where

it  says  markers

now  the  way  this  works  is

the  ones  in  the  front

the  first  one  and  the  last  one  are  the

first  and  the  third  this  represents  the

start  point  of  the  path  and  this

represents  the  end  point  of  the  path  and

this  represents  all  of  the  nodes

in  the  middle  of  the  path  that  go  along

the  path  so  to  demonstrate  how  this

works  let  me  grab  let  me

click  this  drop  down  right  here  and  im

going  to  grab  this  star  and  apply  that

as  the  start  node

im  going  to  grab  this  end  one  and  im

going  to  apply  this  star  as  the  end  node

theres  nothing  visibly  changing  on  my

screen  here  because  im  using  a  closed

path  if  youre  using  a  linear  path  like

a  straight  line  you  should  see  a  star  at

this  at  the  front  and  at  the  back  of  the

path  like  that  and  then  ill  apply  this

one  to  all  of  the  nodes  in  the  middle

like  that  and  as  you  can  see  here  we  now

have  this  object  going  along  the  path

now  if  we  want  to  add  more  objects  in

here  we  can  just  add  new  we  can  just  add

more  nodes  so  let  me  come  over  here  to

the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

im  going  to  click  and  drag  over  all  of

the  nodes  to  select  them  like  that  and

im  going  to  click  this  button  over  here

that  says  insert  new  nodes  into  selected

segments

and  as  i  insert  new  nodes  like  that  its

going  to  insert

more  of  the  object  as  you  can  see  here

now  if  at  any  point  you  want  to  alter

this  you  could  just  click  on  one  of

these  nodes  and  you  can  move  it  around

like  that  as  you  can  see  here

now  let  me  go  ahead  and  undo  that

because  thats  not  the  result  i  was

going  for

now  lets  say  you  want  to  alter  these

markers  further  you  want  to  make  them

bigger  or  smaller  or  maybe  even  rotate

them  to  do  that  what  you  could  do  is  let

me  first  go  back  to  the  selection  tool

if  you  click  on  one  of  these  drop  downs

over  here  where  the  markers  are  we  have

this  new  revamped  menu  as  of  inkscape

version  1.2  with  all  of  these  neat

little  options  that  we  can  edit  if  you

click  on  the  button  that  says  edit  on

canvas

youre  going  to  get  these  transformation

handles  now  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  by

holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse

wheel

how  this  works  is  the  transformation

handles  that  are  squares  allow  you  to

distort  and  scale  the  object  like  that

so  i  can  control  the  width  the  height

and  i  can  just  scale  it  down  by  holding

ctrl  if  you  want  to  lock  lock  the

proportions  like  that  you  can  make  it

bigger

or  smaller  as  you  can  see  there  now  if

you  want  to  rotate  the  object  all  you

have  to  do  is  click  on  this  round  node

right  here  and  allow  you  to  rotate  the

object  like  that

pretty  simple

and  if  at  any  point  you  want  to  get  back

to  this  lets  say  you  deselect  it  and

you  get  out  of  here  if  at  any  point  you

want  to  get  back  to  editing  that  all  you

have  to  do  is  select  the  object  and  then

come  over  here  and  click  the  drop  down

and  click  on  edit  on  canvas  and  you  can

edit  that  again  like  that

okay  so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for

this  lesson  actually  no  theres  one  more

thing  i  want  to  mention  about  this

feature  whenever  you  have  markers  on  a

path  they  behave  sort  of  like  a  stroke

so  over  here  this  button  right  here  that

says  when  scaling  objects  scale  the

stroke  width  by  the  same  proportion

if  this  if  this  option  is  disabled  as  it

is  on  my  screen  that  means  as  you  scale

this  object  down

the  stars  are  going  to  say  are  going  to

stay  the  same  shape

so  marker  that  you  have  applied  will

remain  the  same  shape  regardless  of  how

big  or  small  you  make  the  path  that  its

placed  along  if  youd  like  the  markers

to  scale  alongside  the  object  all  you

have  to  do  is  enable  this  setting  right

here  and  now  itll  scale  with  it  like

that  without  changing  its  size

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

lesson  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

using  markers  in  inkscape  to  repeat  an

object  along  a  path  without  deforming  it

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

maybe  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  i  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  i

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  i  just

did  in  this  video  we  even  have  a  private

community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

ill  have  some  information  about  that  in

the  description  below  if  you  have  any

questions  let  me  know  and  as  always

thanks  for  watching
