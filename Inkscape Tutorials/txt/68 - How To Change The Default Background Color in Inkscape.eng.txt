this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  make  Inkscape  have  a  dark

workspace  on  the  canvas  like  illustrator

has  and  this  is  something  that  Ive  been

asked  about  a  lot  especially  by  those  of

you  who  are  switching  over  to  Inkscape

from  Illustrator  and  find  the  glaring

white  canvas  of  Inkscape  to  be  somewhat

of  a  nuisance  when  youre  working  but

before  we  get  started  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  Inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  my  Inkscape

masterclass  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  Inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  Ill  have  a  link  in  the  description

of  the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that

out  so  to  get  us  started  here  the  first

thing  you  want  to  do  is  just  make  sure

that  you  are  working  with  the  proper

version  of  Inkscape  which  is  version  1.0

or  above  if  you  dont  know  what  your

version  is  just  click  on  help  and  go  to

about  Inkscape  and  it  will  tell  you  in

this  little  pop-up  window  here  as  you

can  see  I  am  using  version  1.0  if  youre

using  1.0  or  above  or  greater  like  a

newer  version  then  youre  good  to  go  you

can  close  out  of  that  if  youre  using  an

older  version  like  0.9  2.5  or  or

something  even  older  than  that  youll

probably  have  to  use  one  of  my  older

tutorials  because  what  Im  going  to

demonstrate  here  wont  apply  to  those

older  versions  so  lets  close  out  of

that  lets  set  the  dark  theme  first

lets  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

edit  and  go  to  preferences  and  Im  gonna

come  over  to  let  me  close  the  Tools  menu

let  me  open  up  the  interface  menu  and

expand  that  Im  gonna  click  on  theme  Im

gonna  use  dark  theme  check  that  and  then

use  symbolic  icons  and  check  that  and  as

you  can  see  here  its  already  looking  a

lot  more  like  illustrator  so  lets  close

out  of  this  menu  what  we  want  to  do  now

is  make  the  workspace  have  a  dark

background  here  so  to  do  that  well  get

a  file  document  properties  and  where  it

says  background  color  lets  open  that  up

and  Im  going  to  choose  HSL  from  the

color  selector  and  Im  going  to  choose

the  L  row  down  here  and  just  slide  that

up  and  as  you  can  see  it  is  changing  the

background  its  changing  the  canvas

background  as  I  change  it  there  and  Im

going  to  leave  it  right  about  there

thats  looking  pretty  good  as  you  can

see  its  already  a  lot  easier  on  the

eyes  it  isnt  it  isnt

you  dont  have  like  this  bright  white

background  shining  into  your  eyes  so  let

me  close  out  of  that  and  close  out  of

that  what  we  need  now  is  a  white  like  a

white  art  board  to  work  with  to  do  that

let  me  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  Im  going  to  create  a  rectangle  and

Im  going  to  grab  the  select  tool  let  me

size  this  rectangle  let  me  set  the

increments  to  pixels  Im  going  to  size

it  by  1280  by  1280  if  you  can  size  it  to

whatever  you  want  I  just  like  to  work

with  1280  by  1280  as  a  default  Im  going

to  make  that  white  and  now  Im  going  to

open  up  the  document  properties  again

Im  going  to  file  document  properties

and  over  here  were  looking  for  resized

page  to  content  right  there  and  resize

page  to  drawing  or  selection  click  on

that  and  its  going  to  resize  the  page

boundaries  around  that  rectangle  you

have  selected  and  where  it  says  show

page  Bodrum  is  going  to  disable  that  Id

rather  that  not  be  there  lets  close  out

of  that  and  as  you  can  see  we  now  have  a

white  artboard  to  work  with  let  me  zoom

in  on  this  a  little  bit  but  the  problem

youll  have  now  is  that  you  can

accidentally  click  this  thing  and  alter

it  while  youre  working  itll  get  your

way  so  in  order  to  anchor  this  thing

down  what  Im  going  to  do  is  use  layers

so  Ill  come  over  here  to  the  layers

menu  lets  click  on  that  ctrl  shift  and

L  is  the  keyboard  shortcut  and  Im  gonna

rename  this  layer  to  canvas  and  Im

going  to  lock  it  Im  going  to  lock  that

layer  so  that  we  cant  click  on  it  and

edit  it  while  were  working  and  now  Im

going  to  add  a  new  layer  on  top  of  it

and  Im  going  to  name  this  content  this

is  the  content  layer  click  Add  and  there

you  go  now  you  have  a  set  up  similar  to

illustrator  where  you  have  a  black  or  a

dark  work  space  with  a  white  artboard

then  you  can  export  as  needed  a  couple

of  things  though  Id  like  to  point  out

number  one  is  Inkscape  does  not

recognize  this  white  background  as  an

actual  background  it  recognizes  it  as  a

white  rectangle  so  if  you  go  to  export

an  object  on  top  of  this  background  its

going  to  export  the  white  rectangle  with

it  let  me  show  you  what  I  mean  here  if  I

grab  the  the  circles  and  ellipses  tool

and  I  click  and  drag  to  create  the

ellipse  let  me  just  make  that  red  if  I

go  to  file  export  PNG  image

and  I  exported  by  selection  its  going

to  export  everything  within  this

rectangular  bounding  box  including  the

white  background  there  because  like  I

said  Inkscape  does  not  recognize  this  as

a  background  it  recognizes  it  as  a  white

object  so  normally  it  would  export  to

transparency  here  but  now  over  this

object  its  going  to  export  with  the

white  background  to  change  that  you  can

just  select  this  option  right  here  that

says  hide  all  except  selected  and  with

that  with  that  selected  you  can  now

export  this  red  ellipse  and  get  a

transparent  background  in  the  corners

here  if  you  want  to  save  this  as  your

startup  file  so  that  you  dont  have  to

manually  create  this  every  time  you  want

to  design  something  just  go  to  file  save

template  and  Im  going  to  title  this

dark  canvas  and  where  it  says  set  as

default  template  go  ahead  and  check  that

you  know  what  let  me  get  rid  of  this

right  let  me  get  rid  of  this  ellipse

first  and  dont  want  that  in  there  lets

go  to  file  save  as  no  Im  sorry  not  save

as  save  template  and  save  this  as  dark

canvas  and  set  as  default  template  and

go  ahead  and  click  Save  and  what  happens

now  is  you  can  go  ahead  and  close  out  of

Inkscape  and  once  you  reload  Inkscape

every  time  you  open  up  Inkscape  now  you

will  get  this  as  your  default  template

so  that  you  dont  have  to  do  this  all

the  time  if  you  dont  feel  like  setting

this  up  what  Ill  do  is  I  will  save  this

document  as  an  SVG  file  and  I  will  post

a  link  to  it  in  the  description  of  the

video  so  if  you  want  you  could  just

download  this  file  you  can  open  it  up

with  Inkscape  and  then  just  go  directly

to  file  save  template  and  save  it  as

your  default  template  from  there  so  I

think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

creating  a  a  dark  workspace  in  Inkscape

like  you  would  have  an  illustrator  if

you  have  any  questions  leave  a  comment
