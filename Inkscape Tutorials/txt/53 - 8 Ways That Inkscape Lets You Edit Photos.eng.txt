although  inkscape  is  meant  for  working

with  vector  graphics

it  does  have  some  features  and  tools

that  allow  you  to  make  common  edits  to

photographs  and  other  types  of

rasterized  images

and  even  though  youd  be  better  off

using  proper  photo  editing  software  for

this  sort  of  thing

you  may  find  yourself  working  in  a

vector  environment  once  in  a  while

and  needing  to  just  make  a  quick  edit  to

an  image

in  these  instances  launching  yet  another

application  can  be  an  inconvenience

this  is  where  inkscapes  photo  editing

ability  comes  in  handy

and  in  this  video  ill  be  going  over  8

different  ways  in  which  you  can  edit

photos

in  inkscape



this  is  nick  with  logosbynick.com  and  in

this  video  ill  be  going  over  some  of

the  ways  in  which  you  can  edit  photos  in

inkscape

but  before  we  get  started  if  youd  like

to  learn  everything  that  there  is  to

know  about  inkscape  be  sure  to  check  out

my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate

how  it  works  ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out

the  first  way  in  which  you  can  edit  a

photo  in  inkscape  is  by  cropping  it

to  crop  your  photo  all  you  have  to  do  is

create  a  rectangle  going  over  the

portion  of  the  photo  youd  like  to  crop

and  then  create  a  clipping  mask  from  it

from  there  you  can  just  resize  your

document  based  on  the  cropped  image  by

pressing  ctrl

shift  and  r  and  then  from  there  you  can

export  your  work  as  a  png  file

ill  have  a  tutorial  linked  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  need

more  details

not  only  can  clipping  pads  be  used  to

crop  photos  in  inkscape

but  they  can  also  be  used  to  extract

subjects  from  the  photo

this  allows  you  to  do  all  kinds  of

unique  things  like  create  a  photo

pop-out  effect  or

remove  a  background  from  an  image  these

extractions  can  be  made  by  simply

grabbing  the  bezier  pen

and  manually  drawing  a  path  around  the

subject  youd  like  to  extract

then  from  there  you  can  create  a

clipping  path  from  it  by  selecting  both

objects

and  navigating  to  object  clip  set

another  way  that  you  can  edit  photos  in

inkscape  is  by  adjusting  their  opacity

and  inkscape  allows  you  to  change

opacity  values  in  a  variety  of  different

ways

you  can  change  the  overall  opacity  of  an

image  by  selecting  it  and  opening  the

fill  and  stroke  menu

from  there  grab  the  opacity  slider  and

adjust  it  to  your  liking

you  can  also  give  a  photo  partial

transparency  or  a  transparency  gradient

by  using  layer  masks  this  makes  it  so

that  one  side  of  an  image  is  visible

but  gradually  tapers  off  to  transparency

this  can  be  really  useful  when  designing

things  like  headers  and  posters  where

you  need  to  incorporate  imagery  with

text  in  other  vector  elements

layer  masking  is  somewhat  of  an  advanced

topic  but  the  gist  of  it  is  that  you

create  an  object  with  the  black  and

white  gradient

and  then  apply  it  over  your  image  as  a

mask  the  black  areas  create  a

transparent  area  in  the  photo  whereas

the  white  areas  remain  opaque

ill  have  a  tutorial  for  this  linked  in

the  description  of the  video  if  you  want

a  more  in-depth  explanation

inkscape  also  allows  you  to  make  some

common  color  adjustments  to  your  photos

for  example  you  can  invert  the  colors  of

an  image  by  selecting  it  and  navigating

to  filters

colors  invert  you  can  also  make  your

image  black  and  white

or  grayscale  by  navigating  to  filters

color

grayscale  and  from  there  you  can  adjust

the  rgb  values  to  your  liking

in  fact  the  filters  menu  has  lots  of

interesting  and  unique  effects  that  can

be  applied  to  your  images

so  be  sure  to  browse  through  there  and

experiment  for  yourself

speaking  of  color  adjustments  inkscape

also  allows  you  to  make  some  more

advanced  color  corrections  like  color

channels  and

levels  and  hsb  values  all  you  have  to  do

to  access  these  settings  is  navigate  to

extensions

and  raster  and  from  there  you  will  have

a  wide  array  of  raster  effects  that  you

can  use  to  edit  your  photos  in  inkscape

in  a  past  tutorial  i  used  these  effects

to  create  a  carved  wood  effect

from  an  image  of  a  piece  of  wood

another  common  edit  you  may  like  to

apply  to  your  photos  once  in  a  while  is

to  apply  a  blur  or  maybe  sharpen  your

image

to  apply  a  blur  open  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  by  pressing  ctrl

shift  and  the  letter  a  on  your  keyboard

and  from  there  you  can  use  the  blur

slider  to  apply  a  gaussian  blur  to  your

liking

to  sharpen  your  image  simply  navigate  to

filters

image  effects  and  select  sharpen

unfortunately

theres  no  way  to  adjust  the  threshold

of  the  filter  but  this  can  still  be  a

handy  trick

for  a  quick  touch-up

as  we  went  over  earlier  you  can  use  the

bezier  pen  to  manually  draw

shapes  over  subjects  to  extract  them

from  their  background

if  the  background  youd  like  to  remove

is  white  though  then  you  wont  need  to

go  through  all  of  that  trouble

you  can  simply  use  the  trace  bitmap

feature  to  generate  a  vector  silhouette

of  your  subject  then  apply  it  as  a

clipping  path

it  should  be  noted  that  this  method  is

far  from  perfect  there  are  instances

where  the  auto  trace  feature  wont  be

able  to  make  an  accurate  distinction

between  the  foreground  and  the

background

but  when  it  does  work  it  can  save  you  an

incredible  amount  of  time

the  final  method  that  you  can  deploy  for

editing  photos  in  inkscape

is  using  blend  modes  this  is  somewhat  of

a  hidden  feature  in  inkscape  that  not  a

lot  of  users  know  about

to  access  it  open  your  layers  menu  by

pressing  ctrl

shift  and  l  on  your  keyboard  from  there

you  can  add  a  new  layer  on  top  of  your

image  layer

and  any  of  the  contents  placed  on  that

layer  can  be  blended  into  the  image

beneath  it

using  the  blend  mode  drop  down  near  the

bottom  of  the  menu

as  you  could  imagine  weve  only  begun  to

scratch  the  surface  of  all  the  different

ways  that  you  can  edit  photos  in

inkscape

although  these  features  may  not  be  as

robust  or  intuitive  as  a  raster  image

editor  like

they  can  still  come  in  handy  if  you  just

need  a  quick  and  basic  edit

and  you  dont  feel  like  launching

another  application  let  me  know  in  the

comments  if  theres  any  ways  that  you

like  to  edit  photos  in  inkscape  that  i

may  not  have  gone  over  in  this  video

and  as  always  thanks  for  watching
