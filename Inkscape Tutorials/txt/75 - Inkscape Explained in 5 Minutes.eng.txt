if  youre  new  to  graphic  design  then  you

may  be  unfamiliar  with  what  the

different  types  of  design  are  why

theyre  used  and  how  theyre  made  in

this  video  Ill  be  giving  you  a  brief

overview  of  what  Vector  design  is  in

particular  and  how  you  can  use  inkscape

to  create



it  this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  nick.com

and  today  Ill  be  explaining  how

inkscape  Works  in  5  minutes  or  less

inkscape  is  a  free  an  open  source  vector

graphics  editor  similar  to  Adobe

Illustrator  the  graphical  format  you  may

be  most  familiar  with  would  probably  be

the  raster  format  where  youre  working

with  a  bunch  of  individual  colored  boxes

known  as  pixels  this  describes  things

like  photographs  and  jpeg  images  vector

graphics  arent  made  of  pixels  though

theyre  a  series  of  mathematical

equations  that  dictate  the  properties  of

a  graphic  on  an  X  Andy  AIS  the  benefit

of  working  with  vector  graphics  is  that

theyre  easier  to  manipulate  and  you  can

enlarge  them  infin  itely  without  quality

loss  this  makes  vectors  ideal  for  things

like  logos  and  app  icons  where  youll

need  to  use  the  same  design  in  a  variety

of  different  sizes  vector  graphics  can

also  be  used  to  create  things  like

characters  and  mascots  digital

illustrations  menu  icons  for  the  web  and

they  can  even  be  used  in  combination

with  raster  images  to  create

advertisements  headers  for  social  media

or  anything  else  youd  like  my  favorite

tool  for  creating  vector  graphics  is

inkscape  and  on  this  channel  youll  find

hundreds  of  tutorials  for  learning  how

to  use  inkscape  to  create  things  like

logos  icons  posters  textures  and  more

when  you  launch  inkscape  for  the  first

time  after  downloading  it  you  may  notice

that  it  doesnt  quite  look  the  same  on

your  screen  as  it  does  on  mine  when

following  along  with  one  of  my  tutorials

you  can  change  this  by  going  to  edit

preferences  interface  and  theme  and

ticking  on  the  boxes  to  use  a  dark  theme

along  with  the  symbolic  icons  this  is

not  something  thats  necessary  but  it

just  may  be  easier  for  you  to  follow

along  Ong  with  my  lessons  if  things  look

the  same  on  your  screen  as  they  do  on

mine  the  tools  menu  on  the  left  hand

side  of  the  screen  allows  you  to  create

Vector  objects  like  squares  circles

stars  and  polygons  and  you  can  even  use

tools  like  the  beier  pen  and  the

freehand  tool  to  draw  your  own  Vector

shapes  you  can  then  edit  the  structural

properties  of  those  shapes  using  the

edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  which  allows  you

to  change  the  Contours  of  individual

lines  and  the  key  points  of  the  design

otherwise  known  as  nodes  you  can  add

nodes  remove  nodes  and  even  change  the

type  of  node  youre  working  with  you  can

then  give  those  shapes  whatever  color

you  want  using  the  color  palette  at  the

bottom  of  the  screen  or  you  can  choose

Your  Colors  by  RGB  or  hex  code  by

opening  up  the  fill  and  stroke  menu  you

can  even  fill  your  objects  with  a

gradient  which  is  basically  a  transition

between  two  different  colors  the  path

menu  at  the  top  of  the  screen  is  a

series  of  path  operations  that  allows

you  to  take  objects  that  youve  already

created  and  turn  them  into  new  objects

based  on  how  you  make  them  interact  with

each  other  you  can  unify  them  together

subtract  them  from  each  other  use  the

intersecting  area  between  them  to  create

a  new  object  and  more  theres  even  a

more  advanced  feature  known  as  live  path

effects  which  allows  you  to  manipulate

your  vector  objects  even  further

inkscape  also  has  a  powerful  text  editor

built  in  that  allows  you  to  flow  text

inside  of  objects  wrap  it  around  objects

and  even  warp  it  into  different  shapes

and  theres  countless  other  features  in

inkscape  that  make  it  a  powerful  tool

like  texture  masking  and  clone  stamping

once  you  have  a  solid  understanding  of

how  all  of  this  works  you  can  create

some  really  impressive  designs  there

really  are  no  limitations  to  what  you

can  create  with  inkscape  its  just  as

powerful  as  any  other  vector  graphics

tool  out  there  commercial  or  otherwise

Ive  personally  been  using  inkscape  as

my  primary  tool  for  over  a  decade  to

design  logos  for  my  clients  and  graphics

for  my  own  website  I  even  have  an  online

course  called  The  inkscape  Master  Class

where  I  go  over  every  single  tool  and

feature  in  inkscape  and  explain  how  it

works  its  kind  of  like  a  user  manual

but  in  video  format  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  want  and  it  may  be  helpful  in  giving

some  context  to  my  lessons  here  on

YouTube  Ill  put  a  link  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  youre

interested  in  checking  that  out

otherwise  if  youre  just  curious  about

seeing  what  inkscape  is  capable  of  and

maybe  dabbling  around  with  it  a  bit  then

feel  free  to  check  out  any  of  the

hundreds  of  tutorials  I  have  on  this

channel  I  even  have  a  beginners  playlist

that  would  be  ideal  for  firsttime  users
