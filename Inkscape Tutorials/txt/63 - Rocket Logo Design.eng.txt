this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this

rocket  logo  design  using  inkscape  but

before  we  get  started  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  ill  put  a

link  in  the  description  of  the  video  if

you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is  just  set

up

the  uh  the  screen  here  so  that  were  all

working  with  the  similar  layout  i  want

to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says  view

make  sure  we  have  custom  selected  im

going  to  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

zoom  and  im  going  to  zoom  in  at  one  to

one

and  then  im  going  to  open  up  the  align

and  distribute  menu  with  this  button

over  here  or  you  can  press  ctrl

shift  and  a  i  want  to  have  last  selected

chosen  from  this  relative  two

and  then  i  want  to  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  which  is  over  here  you  can

click  on  that  or  you  can  press  ctrl

shift  and  f  to  open  that  up  so  what  im

going  to  do  first  is  im  going  to  create

a  circle  that  is  going  to

encapsulate  the  entire  design  so  let  me

grab  the  circles  and  ellipses  tool

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  on  the

canvas  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift

and  click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  to

create  a  perfectly  round  circle  like

that

now  let  me  grab  the  select  tool  let  me

move  this  over  what  i  want  to  do  now  is

just  bring  down  the  opacity  of  this  a

little  bit  im  going  to  take  the  opacity

bring  that  down  roughly  in  half  were

going  to  want  to  be  able  to  see  through

what  were  working  with

as  we  go  through  this  tutorial  one  other

thing  i  wanted  to

i  forgot  to  mention  up  here  where  it

says  enable  snapping  make  sure  you  have

this  turned  off  for  the  duration  of  this

tutorial  or  for  now  anyway  so

go  ahead  and  disable  that  i  think  by

default  its  enabled  so  just  go  ahead

and

disable  that  so  we  have  our  circle  right

there  what  i  want  to  do  is  just

duplicate  this  circle  by  hitting  control

d

im  going  to  make  this  copy  green  and

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and

scale  this  down  a  little  bit

and  what  im  going  to  do  here  is  im

going  to  create  some  plumes  of  smoke

going  towards  the  bottom  of  the  uh

the  bottom  of  the  design  here  let  me

show  you  here  were  going  to  create  this

segment  right  here  using  a  bunch  of

individual  circles  so  let  me

minimize  that  im  going  to  make  this  one

a  little  bigger

put  this  right  about  here  duplicate  this

by  pressing  ctrl  d

make  this  one  a  little  smaller  again

holding  ctrl  and  shift  while  scaling

this  down  to  lock  the  proportions

ctrl  d  to  duplicate  again  hold  ctrl  and

shift  make  this  one  a  little  smaller

maybe  ill  put  this  over  here

put  the  medium  size  over  here  on  the

left  put  the  smaller  one  right  here  like

that

maybe  make  this  a  little  smaller

duplicate  this  by  hitting  ctrl  d  bring

this  over  here

duplicate  this  one  put  this  over  here

maybe  like  that  and  right  there  thats

about  what  im  looking  for  i  want  to

have  this

this  is  going  to  represent  the  the  the

clouds  are  like  the  exhaust  coming  from

the  rocket  here

and  uh  what  i  want  to  do  now  is  i  just

want  to  make  sure  the  bottom  portion  of

this  design  is  covered  in  as  well  so  im

going  to  duplicate  some  more  of  these

circles

and  just  scale  them  up  so  that  its

covering  the  entire  portion  of  the

design  as  you  can  see  im  stamping  these

circles  by  pressing  spacebar  as  i  move

them  around

that  right  there  is  what  were  looking

for  we  want  to  make  sure  everythings

covered  here  we  dont  have  any  of  the

main  circles  sticking  out  let  me  just

zoom  in  to  make  sure

okay  good  we  dont  want  any  of  that

and  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  if  you

notice  over  here  theres  little  indents

coming  in  from  these  circles  so  were

going  to  create  those  next

so  let  me  go  and  take  im  going  to  start

with  this  circle  right  here

to  zoom  in  and  out  im  holding  ctrl  and

rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel

and  to  move  them  to  move  the  page  around

im  pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel  and

moving  the  mouse

im  going  to  duplicate  this  by  hitting

control  d  im  going  to  make  that  red

and  then  im  going  to  duplicate  it  again

by  hitting  control  d  and  im  going  to

make  this  one  green

and  let  me  just  move  this  one  over  like

this  and  were

looking  at  the  uh  the  area  thats

sticking  out  here  the  color  of  red

thats  sticking  out  thats  what  we  want

to  pay  attention  to

something  like  that  right  there  is  what

im  looking  for  im  going  to  hold  shift

click  on  the  red  circle  behind  it  so  we

have  both  of  these  selected  and  go  to

path

difference  now  i want  to  do  the  same

thing  for  all  of  the  circles  at  the  top

here  so  let  me  zoom  in  so  i  can  see  this

a  little  better

i  want  to  move  this  circle  over  so  that

its  intersecting  with  this  area  a

little  more  so  let  me  duplicate  this  by

hitting  ctrl  d

make  that  red  duplicate  it  again  make  it

green

and  ill  move  this  one  out  here  like

this

and  one  thing  im  looking  for  when  i  do

this  i  want  to  make  sure  if  you  notice

the  tip

of  the  uh  the  red  crescent  here  is  going

over  the  red  crescent  over  here  that  we

previously  created  we  want  to  make  sure

that  those  two  things  are  intersecting

and  overlapping  completely

you  dont  want  to  leave  it  like  this

where  its  not  going  all  the  way  through

so  thats  one  thing  to  keep  in  mind

while  youre  going  about  this

if  you  have  to  you  can  take  this  one

hold  shift  click  the  one  beneath  it  and

then  just  click  it  again  to  get  the

rotation  handles  and  just  rotate  it

around

to  position  it  in  a  better  spot  all

right  so  that  that  right  there  is  good

how  it  is  im  going  to  hold  shift

click  both  of  those  and  go  to  path

difference  there  we  go

and  maybe  maybe  ill  rotate  these  around

a  little  bit  like  that

and  im  gonna  have  to  move  this  one  i

can  tell  already  im  gonna  move  this  one

up  here

again  duplicate  that  make  that  red

duplicate  it  again  make  it  green

and  im  going  to  position  this  one  like

this

maybe  over  here  like  this

again  now  this  is  not  overlapping  so

what  i  want  to  do  is  move  this

down  like  that  there  we  go  thats  what

im  looking  for  now  let  me  take  those  go

to  path

difference  again  to  select  two  objects

at  the  same  time  just  holding  shift

and  clicking  each  of  them  do  the  same

thing  over  here  ctrl  d

were  pretty  much  just  repeating  this

process  over  and over  again  until  we  get

to  the

end  of  the  exhaust  plume  here

thats  good

oops  did  i  miss  that  there  we  go  and

well  do  the  same  thing  over  here

you  know  im  going  to  rotate  this  around

a  little  bit

yeah  maybe  ill  rotate  it  around  some

more  like  that  oops

okay  thats  good  and  then  finally  this

last  one  over  here  im  going  to

just  adjust  that  a  little  bit  duplicate

that

make  that  red  duplicate  it  again  make  it

green

and  there  we  go  path  difference

okay  so  we  have  this  set  in  place  now

what  i  want  to  do  now  is

if  you  notice  the  areas  where  the  red

crescents  the  tips  of  them  are  sticking

out  from  each  other  i  just  want  to  go

and  manually

remove  those  from  certain  areas  so  im

going  to  remove  this  area  from  this

crescent  here  to  do  that  im  going  to

grab  the  bezier  pen

which  is  over  here  you  can  press  b  on

the  keyboard  im  going  to  create

an  object  going  around  the  tip  of  that

crescent  right  there

grab  the  select  tool  hold  shift  click  on

the  red  shape  and  go  to  path

difference  and  ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  back  to  the  bezier  pen

im  just  going  to  press  b  on  the

keyboard  its  easier  to  do  it  that  way

back  to  the  starting  point  back  to  the

select  tool  for  that  we  press  s  on  the

keyboard

hold  shift  path  difference

and  ill  go  over  here  and  do  the  same

thing  let  me  get  rid  of  the  uh

this  area  right  here  path

difference

oops  path

difference  there  we  go  and  then  ill

delete  this  part  right  here  so  let  me

grab  the  bezier  pen  again

bring  this  through  like  that

back  to  the  select  tool  actually  no  this

one  right  here

path  difference  there  we  go

okay  so  now  i  want  to  take  all  of  the

red  objects  right  here  im  just  going  to

click  on  one  of  them

and  go  to  edit  select  same

fill  color  and  thats  going  to  select

all  of  the  red  objects  right  there  and

go  to

path  union  and  now  i  want  to  unify

all  of  the  green  circles  together  so  let

me  click  on  the  green  circle  and  go  to

edit

select  same  fill  color  and  go  to

path  union  okay  so  what  i  want  to  do  now

is  create  an  offset

of  this  um  this  green

cloud  right  here  so  to  do  that  im  just

going  to  press  ctrl  d

on  the  keyboard  to  duplicate  that  im

going  to  make  this  blue

and  im  going  to  lower  this  beneath  the

other  two  objects  we  just  created  so

come  up  here  where  it  says  lower

selection  one  step  ill  click  that  once

and  then  twice  we  want  it  to  go  beneath

the  red  and  the  green  objects  and  then

go  to

path  and  were  looking  for  dynamic

offset

and  once  we  get  dynamic  offset  were

going to  take  this  little  node  right

here  and  just  bring  this  out  like  that

maybe  about  that  much  thats  a  good

amount  of  padding  right  there  so  well

go  to

path  object  to  path  to  to  finalize  that

were  going  to  what  im  going  to  create

now  is  the  exhaust  trail  coming  from  the

rocket  let  me  show  you  here  this  little

stream  this  little  jet  stream  coming

from  the  rocket  thats  going  to  be  the

next

thing  that  we  create  so  lets  move  this

off  to  the  side  a little  bit  again  to

move  the  page  around  just

pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel  and  moving

the  mouse  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangles  tool  right  here

create  a  rectangle  like  this  make  this

green  because  we  want  that  to  match  this

green  here

and  now  im  going  to  grab  the  circles

and  ellipses  tool  and  make  another

make  a  an  ellipse  going  over  it  like

that  now  let  me  make  that  red  so  we  can

see  it

grab  the  select  tool

duplicate  this  shape  by  pressing  ctrl  d

and  then  hold  ctrl  and  click  and  drag

this  off  to  the  right  over  here

and  what  were  paying  attention  to  is

the  intersecting  area  between

uh  or  the  absent  area  between  the  two

red  red  circles  here  this  green

object  is  whats  going  to  be  what

remains  so  let  me  bring  this  down  a

little  bit

this  is  going  to  be  our  little  jet

stream  right  here  so

i  think  that  looks  good  right  there  so

im  going  to  hold  shift  click  both  red

circles  go  to

path  union  hold  shift  click  on  the  green

rectangle  and  go  to  path

difference  and  what  im  going  to  do  now

is  create

some  empty  space  in  the  middle  of  it

like  you  see  right  here

so  to  do  that  let  me  duplicate  this  ctrl

d  ill  make  this  red  im  going  to  bring

this  in  a little  bit

bring  this  side  in  a  little  bit  bring

this  in  some  more  like  that

move  this  over  thats  looking  pretty

good

now  let  me  hold  shift  and  click  on  both

of  those  so  we  have  them  both  selected

and  where  it  says  align  were  gonna  go

to  our  align  menu  and  click  on

uh  center  on  vertical  axis  like  that  and

now  im  just  gonna  take  this

maybe  bring  this  down  a little  bit  bring

this  up  a  little  bit  so  that

it  sticks  out  from  the  edges  there  and

then  select  them  both

and  go  to  path  difference

and  now  we  have  our  little  jet  stream  so

let  me  hold  ctrl  and  just  scale  this

down

let  me  put  this  in  place  over  here  with

the  rest  of  the  design

thats  looking  pretty  good  im  going  to

hold  shift  click  on  the  circle  so  we  can

center  this  up  on  our  emblem  here

there  we  go  click  off  of  that  to

deselect  everything  now  im  going  to

take  this

and  im  going  to  lower  it  beneath  the

cloud  here  so  im  going  to  click  this

button  that  says  lower  selection  one

step

one  two  three  we  want  it  going  beneath

the  blue  object  there  but  above  the

black  circle  here  so  let  me  zoom  back

out

this  time  were  going  to  use  a  different

approach  for  creating  the  offset  were

going to  use  a  stroke  this  time  because

of  the  way  that  this

object  is  structured  so  let  me  duplicate

this  object  by  hitting  ctrl  d

im  going  to  make  this  blue  and  then

give  it  a  blue  stroke  by  holding  shift

and  clicking  on  the  color  blue

and  im  going  to  lower  that  down  until

it  goes  beneath  the  green

object  there  and  i  want  to  come  over

here  to  where  it  says  stroke  style

and  just  adjust  the  thickness  of  it  here

if  you  notice  the  thickness  of  the  blue

offset  over  here

we  want  this  to  be  significantly  thicker

than  that

so  let  me  increase  that  a  little  bit

okay  right  about  there  that  looks  good

you  can  just  eyeball  it  that  right  there

looks  pretty  good  so  im  going  to  go

ahead  and  go  to

path  stroke  to  path  path

break  apart  were  going  to  ungroup  this

and  then  go  to  path  union  and  the

ungroup  is  right  here  if  you hover  the

cursor  over  the  button  it  says

ungroup  selected  objects  i  just  click  it

a  couple  of  times  just  to  make  sure  its

ungrouped

and  now  what  we  can  do  is  im  going  to

take  this  blue  object  right  here

im  going  to  duplicate  that  by  pressing

ctrl  d  im  going  to  hold  shift

click  on  the  green  object  right  here  and

go  to  path

difference  and  if  you  notice  we  now  have

that  cut  off  there  its  going  to  be

separated  from  the  cloud  at  the  bottom

there  so

thats  why  we  did  that  now  im  going  to

take  the  the  black  circle  in  the

background  control  d

to  duplicate  that  hold  shift  click  on

the  green  cloud  right  there

go  to  path  intersection

and  then  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to

take  this  blue  object

hold  shift  take  this  blue  object  and

then  go  to

path  union

and  then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

black  circle  and  go  to

path  difference  and  now  we  have  that

there  so  let  me  go  to

now  im  going  to  go  to  path  break  apart

click  off  of  the  object  to  deselect

everything  and  if  you  have  this  little

center  piece  here  in  the  middle  you  just

take  that  and  get  rid  of  it

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  im  going

to  take  this  red  object  right  here

hold  shift  click  on  the  green  cloud  and

go  to  path

difference  and  there  we  have  the  uh

the  exhaust  with  the  um  cloud  plume

there

so  what  we  have  to  do  now  is  lets  we

can  start  we  can  actually  start  coloring

this  in  now  so  let  me  select  all  of  this

bring  the  opacity  all  the  way  up  like

that  and  im  going  to  use  a  shade

similar  to  what  i  used  for  the  thumbnail

design  like  a  dark  purple

combined  with  a  lighter  shade  of  purple

like  that

there  we  go  im  going  to  take  that  im

just  going  to  use  the  dropper  to  make

that  the  same  color

there  we  go  and  now  im  going  to  put

some  stars  in  the  background  here  to

make  it  look  more  like  its

more  like  its  in  space  like  that  so  go

ahead  and  grab  the

were  looking  for  the  stars  and  polygons

tool  which  is  right  here

for  the  settings  were  going  to  want

this  one  selected  right  here  that  says

star  instead  of  regular  polygon  were

going  to  want  four  corners

spoke  ratio  0.401

and  then  rounded  and  randomized  both  set

to  zero  im  just  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

shift  and  create  our  little  star  like

that

im  going  to  get  rid  of  that  stroke  or

that  blue  outline  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  this  little  red  x

down  here

and  ill  take  this  and  just  bring  this

over  here  like  this  scale  it  down  so  it

fits

ill  make  this  white  and  ill  just  add  a

few  of  these  in  here

at  different  sizes  to  make  it  look  more

natural

if  youll  make  this  one  a little  bigger

like  that  there  we  go  and  ill  put  the

same  thing  over  here  on  this  side  so

ill  just  select  all  four  of  those

hit  ctrl  d  to  duplicate  and  then  flip

them  horizontally

with  this  button  up  here  and  then  just

move  these  over  here  like  that

and  there  we  go  so  now  we  have  the  stars

set  in  place  so  the  final  step  now

is  to  create  the  little  rocket  at  the

top  of  the  design  here  so  to  do  that

lets  come  over  here  to  the  side  im

going  to  grab  the  circles  and  ellipses

tool  hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  click  and

drag  to  create  a  perfectly  round  circle

and  showing  up  as  white  on  my  screen  so

once  youve  done  that  youll  have  to

change  it  to  a  different  color  like

black

bring  the  opacity  down  in  half  grab  the

select  tool

duplicate  it  with  ctrl  d  and  just  hold

ctrl  and  bring  this  over  like  this  what

were  looking  at  here

is  the  intercepting  area  between  these

two  circles

thats  going  to  make  up  the  top  of  the

rocket  so  let  me  select  both  of  those

and  go  to  path  intersection

and  now  im  going  to  create  the  little

fins  on  the  side  so  to  do  that  im

actually  going  to  create  a  triangle  so

to  create  a  triangle

im  going  to  grab  this  the  squares  and

rectangles  tool

control  and  shift  to  create  a  perfectly

symmetrical  square  like  that

make  sure  it  has  sharp  corners  by

clicking  that  button  right  there  if

its  not  if  youre  not  able  to  click

that  button  that  means  you  already  have

sharp  corners  youre  good  to  go

convert  that  to  a  path  by  going  to  path

object  to  path

grab  the  nodes  tool  and  then  just  take

this  node  right  here  in  the  bottom  right

and  press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get

rid  of  it

now  select  all  three  of  these  nodes  and

come  up  here  to  where  it  says

make  selected  nodes  corner

like  that  go  back  to  the  select  tool

click  on  the  object  again  so  we  get  the

rotation  handles  and  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  just  rotate  this  counter

clockwise  like  this

so  that  its  sitting  up  like  that  im

going  to  position  this  over  here  next  to

the  side  of  the  rocket

you  can  click  on  it  again  to  get  the

scaling  handles  im  just  going  to  scale

it  so  that  it

fits  next  to  the  uh  the  body  of  the

rocket  here

now  i  just  want  to  adjust  this  a  little

bit  so  im  going  to  grab  the  nodes  tool

over  here

im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  this

node  up  here  like  this  and  maybe  ill

take  this  node  and  bring  this  over  to

the  left  as  well

bring  this  down  a  little  bit  maybe  bring

that  up

you  know  what  this  needs  to  be  down  a

little  more  like  that  that  looks  better

okay  so  now  im  just  going  to  duplicate

that

ctrl  d  flip  it  horizontally

hold  ctrl  click  and  drag  it  over  here  to

the  right

and  now  were  going  to  unify  both  of

them  together  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  on  both  of  them  so  we  have  them

both  selected  and  go  to  path

union  and  now  we  can  hold  shift

click  on  this  little  uh  shape  right  here

center  that  up  where  it  says  a  line

come  over  here  to  where  it  says  center

on  vertical  axis

make  sure  its  centered  up  go  to  path

union

and  now  im  just  going  to  close  off  the

bottom  over  here  im  going  to  grab  the

rectangle  tool  and  create  a  little

rectangle  going  over  the  bottom  there

grab  the  select  tool  hold

shift  click  on  the  rocket  and  go  to  path

union  and  now  im  just  going  to  add  a

little  circle  right  here  for  like  a

little

i  guess  its  kind  of  like  a  little

window  im  going to  put  right  there  so

to  do  that

im  going  to  grab  the  circles  and

ellipses  tool  hold  ctrl  and  shift

click  and  drag  to  create  a  perfectly

round  circle  right  there  position  that

right  about  there

or  maybe  right  there  select  both  of

those

and  center  them  up  on  the  vertical  axis

then  duplicate  this  circle  take  that

ctrl  d  let  me  zoom  in  a little  bit

there  we  go  take  the  larger  circle  hold

shift

and  select  the  rocket  as  well  go  to  path

difference  there  we  go  now  we  have  our

window  set

let  me  select  both  of  those  and  go  to

path  union

and  now  our  rocket  is  set  we  just  need

to  place  it  over  the  design  over  here  so

to  do  this  im  just  going  to  place  it

over  here

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  scale  it  down  a

bit

lets  unify  these  two  objects  right  here

the  sky  lets  take  this  guy

hold  shift  take  the  other  side  of  the

sky  and  go  to  path

union  because  i  want  to  make  sure  that

this  rocket  is  centered  up  on  this

design  here  so  let  me  take  the  rocket

hold  shift

click  on  the  sky  and  then  center  it  up

on  the  vertical  axis  like  that

just  bring  this  down  make  it  a little

smaller  like  that

im  going  to  bring  the  opacity  all  the

way  up  and  im  going  to  make  it  the  same

color  as  the  sky  here  so  let  me  grab  the

dropper

and  grab  that  sample  selection  now  i

want  to  create  another  offset  of  this  to

put  above  the

jet  stream  here  so  to  do  that  ctrl  d

make  this  white  hold  shift  click  on

white  again  to  give  this  a  white  stroke

and  then  lower  this  lower  selection  one

step  to  put  it  beneath

the  rocket  there  and  come  over  here  to

the  stroke  style  tab  again

and  adjust  the  width  of  this  so  thats

not  quite

as  wide

im  just  going  to  go  ahead  and  position

this  where  id  like  it  to  be  maybe  down

a little  more

thats  pretty  good  right  there  so  once

weve  done  that  you  can  click  off  it  to

deselect  everything

click  on  the  white  dont  click  on  the

rocket  click  on  the  white  object  beneath

the  rocket  and  go  to  path

stroke  to  path  path  break  apart

ungroup  and  go  to  path

union  and  now  im  going  to  hold  shift

click  on  the  jet  stream  and  go  to  path

difference  and  then  path  break  apart

click  off  it  to  deselect  we  can  get  rid

of  these  objects  now  just  press  delete

on  the  keyboard  to  get  rid  of  them

zoom  back  out  and  as  you  can  see  we  are

finished  we  have  created

our  rocket  logo  design  with  inkscape  if

you  want  now  you  can  go  ahead  and  add

some  text  if  youd  like  otherwise  you

can  just  export  this  design  and  use  it

as  youd  like  so
