this  is  nick  with  logosbynick.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  these  isometric

illustrations

using  inkscape  and  this  is  a  topic  that

ive  gone  over  in  the  past  however

thanks  to  some  of  the  newer  features  in

inkscape  version  1.0

it  now  makes  it  easier  to  make  your

designs  have  rounded  corners

as  you  can  see  in  my  example  design  here

so  that  is  one  of  the  things  i  will  be

going  over  in  this  tutorial

but  before  we  get  started  if  youd  like

to  learn  more  about  how  inkscape  works

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape  and  i  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  the  first  thing  we  want  to  do  when  we

have  inkscape  open  here  is  set  up  our

document  so  that  we  are  all  working  with

a  similar  view  and  layout  so  ill  come

over  here  to  where  it  says

view  make  sure  we  have  custom  selected

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  zoom  im

going  to  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

youre  going to  want  to  make  sure  you

have  snapping  enabled  up  here  it  should

be  enabled  by  default  but  just  make  sure

its  enabled

and  the  snapping  we  want  over  here  is

snap  to  cusp  nodes

and  then  snap  to  grids  which  is  over

here  very  important  for  this  to  be

enabled

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  set  up

the  isometric  grid  on  the  canvas  ill

come  over  here  where  it  says  file

go  to  document  properties  first  i  just

want  to  get  rid  of  the  page  border  im

going  to  click  on  this  box  right  here

that  says  show  page  border  to  get  that

out  of  the  way  when  were  trying  to

create  our  designs

and  over  here  where  it  says  grids  lets

click  on  that  tab  im  going  to  choose

axonometric  grid

click  new  and  for  the  grid  units  im

going  to  choose  pixels

and  if  you  notice  we  now  have  an

isometric  grid  on  the  canvas  here  i  just

want  to  make  those  lines  a  little  more

spaced  out  because  theres  too  many  of

them

on  the  canvas  as  it  is  so  where  it  says

spacing  y

im  just  going  to  change  that  to  50  hit

enter  there  we  go  thats  a  good  thats  a

good  happy  medium  right  there  so  ill  go

ahead  and  close  out  of  that

and  when  im  drawing  isometric  designs

what  i  like  to  do  is  i  like  to  start

with  the  smallest  objects  first  and  then

draw  outwards  to  the  largest  objects

that  way  i  can  ensure  that  i  dont  run

out  of  boxes  as  im  drawing

objects  so  what  i  want  to  do  now  is  draw

the  buttons  of  the  phone  first  because

those  are  the  smallest  objects

what  im  going to  be  drawing  is  a  a

phone  laying  flat  on  a  surface

like  that  so  let  me  grab

let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen  which  is  over

here

and  if  you  notice  the  way  the  grid  works

is  every  five  lines  you  have  a  main  line

which  is  slightly  darker  than  the  other

five  lines  so  what  id  like  to  do  is  i

like  to  start  at  one  of the  main  lines

right  here

click  to  create  a  point  bring  the  line

to  the  other  main  line  right  here

and  over  here  then  up  back  up  here  and

then  back  to  the  starting  point

and  this  is  going  to  be  the  home  button

of  the  phone  and  this  button  is  going  to

have  rounded  corners  but  im  going  to  go

back  and  add  that  later  im  going to

draw  everything  with  sharp  corners  first

and  then  im  going  to  go  back  and  make

the  corners  rounded  later  so  the  next

biggest  object  for  me  to  draw  would  be

the  screen  so

let  me  start  out  here  the  screen  is

going  to  be  over  here  represented  by

this  area

so  im  going  to  start  five  units  away

from  the  button  on  the  left  side  and  one

unit  up

like  that  and  bring  it  the  same  distance

to  the  other  side

using  the  main  lines  as  a  reference

and  then  im  going  to  bring  this  out

here

one  two  three  four  now  you  know  what  i

missed  that  let  me  undo  that  by  hitting

ctrl  z

there  we  go  its  pretty  common  to  miss

the  line  youre  going  for  so  uh  if  you

if  you  end  up  missing  the  line  just  hit

ctrl  z  to  undo  it

or  you  can  go  back  and  edit  it  with  the

nodes  tool  which  ill  show  you  in  a

minute  so

let  me  bring  this  out  here  out  here

about  that  much

up  here  and  then  back  to  the  starting

point

now  if  you  notice  i  totally  missed  the

mark  there  this  line  is  not  parallel  to

this  line  right  here  so  im  going  to

grab  the  nodes  tool  and  fix  that  im

just  going  to  put  that  back  over  here

where  it  should  be

looks  like  i  missed  it  by  one  let  me  try

that

to  move  around  im  just  holding  ctrl  and

rolling  up  and  down  the  mouse  wheel  and

then  im  pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel

and  moving  mouse

to  to  to  move  around  like  that  looks

like  i  got to  go  one  more  like  that

there  we  go  that  looks  that  looks  right

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is

create  the  other  button  up  top  here  or

actually  the  speaker  the  speaker  hole

im  just  going  to  use  this

duplicate  this  object  so  let  me  grab  the

select  tool  click  on  this  object

press  ctrl  d  to  duplicate  it  and  then

click  and  drag  this

up  here  right  there

so  what  im  going  to  draw  now  is  the

outside  edge  of  the  phone  so  let  me  go

back  to  the  bezier  pen

and  im  going  to  start  this  one  unit

away  one  unit  away  from  the  button  here

and  then  down  here

bring  this  out  to  about  there  thats

looking  good

out  here

and  bring  this  one  unit  away  from  this

edge  right  here

and  then  back  to  the  starting  point  now

i  totally  missed  the  mark  there  so  let

me  go  back  and  edit  that

let  me  grab  the  nodes  tool  this  needs  to

be

this  needs  to  be  right  here  okay  thats

looking  good

all  right  so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is

im  going  to  start  rounding  some  of

these  corners  let  me  go  to  the  select

tool

im  going  to  start  with  the  button  right

here  im  going  to  click  on  that  and  i

want  to  open  up  the  path  effects  menu

ill  go  to  path  path  effects

and  im  going  to  click  to  add  a  new  path

effect  this  little  plus  button  right

here

and  im  going  to  look  for  corners  if  you

can  see  i  already  have  it  typed  in

because  i  was  using  this  previously  you

just  type  in  corners

if  you  remove  the  search  function  the

search  text  it  shows  you  all  of  the  path

effects

if  you  just  type  in  corners  there  you  go

theres  the  path  effect  were  looking

for  the  corners

fillet  chamfer  there  we  go

and  what  thats  going  to  do  is  let  me

zoom  in  on  this  if  we  grab  the  nodes

tool

you  notice  we  have  these  four  green

knots  in  the  corners  here

and  you  could  take  these  knots  and  use

it  to  round  to  the  corners  like  that

i  dont  just  want  to  round  to  that  one

corner  though  i  want  to  round  all  of

these  corners  so  im  going to  click  and

drag  over  all  four  of  those  knots

and  then  just  click  in  oops  click  and

drag  this  in  like  this  to  make  these

rounded

and  it  looks  like  the  snapping  is

getting  in  the  way  so  im  going  to

temporarily  disable  snapping

and  then  move  this  in  like  that

and  now  i  can  turn  snapping  back  on  you

know  im  going  to  leave  it  off  because

we  have  to  do  the  same  thing  to  the

other  buttons  so

let  me  come  back  out  here  and  do  the

same  thing  to  this  speaker  hole  right

here

add  a  path  effect  corners

click  and  drag  over  all  four  points  and

then  just  click  and  drag  it  inward  like

that  to  give  it  rounded  corners

over  here  theres  four  different

settings  this  is  the  fillet  setting  if

you  choose  like  chamfer  its  going  to

give  you  a  different  style  of  corner  if

youre  getting  this  different  style  of

corner  when  you  do  this  just  make  sure

you  have  fillet  selected

it  should  be  there  by  default  but  maybe

maybe  its  not  so  thats  how  you  can  set

it  back

if  thats  the  case  and  now  i  want  to

round  the  corners  of  the  phone  edge  here

so  to  do  that  let  me  select  that  object

add  a  new  path  effect  corners  and  for

this  one  i  want  to  turn  snapping  back  on

because  i  want  to  snap  to  one  of  these

grid  lines  im  going  to  click  and  drag

this  down

or  you  know  what  i  have  to  select  all

four  of  them  let  me  click  and  drag  over

all  four  of  them

bring  that  in  like  that  there  we  go

thats  looking  pretty  good  now  thats

looking  more  like  a  phone

okay  so  let  me  uh  let  me  go  back  to  the

select  tool

lets  select  over  all  of  these  objects

and  convert  them  to  paths  well  go  to

path

object  to  path  and  thats  going  to

change  that  from  a  path  effect  to  now

its  an  actual

its  an  actual  path  not  just  a  path

effect  if  that  makes  any  sense

the  reason  why  i  do  that  is  because  this

is  this  is  sort  of  a  new  path  effect  and

it  doesnt  really

function  uh  the  way  it  should  sometimes

ill  theres  sometimes  im  working  with

this  path  effect  and  like  the  corners

will  just  randomly  go  back  to  being

sharp

and  ill  have  to  go  back  and  make  them

rounded  again  thats  why  i  like  to

convert  them  to  path  beforehand  so  i

dont  have  to  go  back  and  do  that  so

let  me  now  lets  now  take  the  button

here  and  just  raise  that  to  the  top  with

this  button  over  here  race

race  selection  to  the  top  same  thing

with  the  screen  right  here  raise

selection  to  the  top

nothing  visually  is  happening  on  the

screen  as  you  do  this  were  just  doing

this  so  that

we  have  these  objects  layered  above  the

background  which  is  the  phone

edge  here  and  ill  do  the  same  thing  to

this  raise  this  to  the  top

and  now  i  want  to  fill  this  in  with  some

color  so  im  going  to  take  this  object

right  here

and  lets  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  with  this  button  over  here

or  you  can  press  ctrl  shift  and  f  on  the

keyboard

and  im  going  to  fill  this  in  maybe  with

like  a  light  shade  of  gray  like  that

thats  looking  pretty  good  lets  get  rid

of  the  outline  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  on  the  x  over  here

i  might  actually  might  want  to  make  that

a little  darker  so  i  can  see  it  better

and  now  i  will  do  the  same  thing  for

this  button  im  going  to  make  this  maybe

a  darker  shade  of  gray

let  me  get  rid  of  that  outline  by

holding  shift  and  clicking  the  x

and  ill  do  the  same  thing  over  here  i

want  to  make  this  the  same  color  so  im

just  going  to  grab  the  dropper  which  is

over  here  and  just  select  that

so  its  the  same  color  and  then  get  rid

of  the  outline  by  holding  shift  and

clicking  the  x

and  now  i  will  grab  the  screen  and  i

guess  i  will  make  that

i  guess  ill  make  that  white  for  now  let

me  get  rid  of  the

outline  by  shift-clicking  the  x  like

that

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to

give  this  phone  a  little  bit  of  depth  i

want  to  make  it  look  like  its  a

three-dimensional  object  so  im  gonna

im  gonna  duplicate  this  background  over

here  and  move  it  down  a little  bit

so  let  me  select  the  object  right  click

it  and  go  to  duplicate

then  hold  ctrl  and  move  it  down  like

that  and

drop  it  to  the  bottom  over  here  where  it

says  lower  selection  to  the  bottom  and  i

want  to  make  this  the  same  color  that

this  object  is  over  here  so  let  me  grab

the  dropper  tool

click  on  that  and  there  we  go

i  actually  might  want  to  move  this  up  a

little  bit  i  dont  want  that  much  depth

that  looks  pretty  good  right  there  so  if

you  notice  here

theres  an  empty  space  between  the  edges

of  these  two  objects  right  here  so  we

want  to  add

lines  right  here  to  fill  that  in  to  make

it  look  to  make  it  look  the  way  its

supposed  to  look

to  do  that  maybe  i  should  put  this  down

back  to  where  it  was  to  better

illustrate  that

to  better  illustrate  what  im  about  to

do  so  im  going  to  put  that  back  to

where  it  was

im  going  to  select  both  objects  the

original  background  im  going  to  hold

shift  click  the  uh  the  new  background  we

just  created  and  ill  go  to  extensions

generate  from  path  and  extrude

and  i  want  to  make  sure  we  have  polygon

selected  and  not  lines  and  go  ahead  and

click  apply

and  thats  going  to  create  new  objects

between  the  two  objects  we  have  selected

as  you  can  see  here

it  created  all  of  those  objects  so  i

want  to  take  this  object  that  we  just

created

and  i  want  to  ungroup  that  with  this

button  up  here  or  ctrl  shift  ungroup

and  i  want  to  get  rid  of  everything

except  for  these  lines  over

here  that  we  just  created  so  im  going

to  hold  shift  and  click  on  that  little

object  right  there  to  deselect  it

come  over  here  hold  shift  click  on  this

object  to  deselect  that

and  then  press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to

get  rid  of  everything  else

and  now  i  can  take  this  object  hold

shift

take  this  object  and  then  hold  shift  and

take  the  bottom  object

and  unify  them  all  together  by  going  to

path

union  and  as  you  can  see  now  it  looks

the  way  its  supposed  to  look

and  if  you  temporarily  disable  let  me

hold  shift

if  you  hold  shift  and  press  three  on  the

keyboard  it  will  temporarily  disable

the  grid  on  this  on  the  screen  so  you

can  see  how  it  looks  without  the  grid

getting  in  the  way

i  might  want  to  take  this  screen  and

make  this  darker  like  that  there  we  go

now  its  looking  more  like  a  phone

okay  so  the  phone  part  of  the  design  is

out  of  the  way  im  now  going  to  create

like  a  little  uh

like  a  little  chat  bubble  to  go  over  the

uh  the  top  of  it  here  like  i  showed  you

in  the

the  design  of  the  thumbnail  to  put  the

grid  back  to  where  it  was

im  just  going  to  hold  shift  and  press

three  on  the  keyboard

or  other  or  in  other  words  you  just  use

the  pound  key  which  is

up  here  where  it  says  view  page  grid

thats  another  way  you  can  toggle  that

off  and  on  i  just  like  to  use  the

keyboard  shortcut  so

lets  create  a  chat  bubble  to  go  over

here  now  so  im  going  to  come  over  here

out  of  the  way

im  going  to  create  three  circles  to

make  it  look  like  somebodys  typing

so  let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen

start  right  there  again  im  using  the

main  lines  in  increments  of  five  to

create  these

there  we  go  im  just  going  to  duplicate

this

ctrl  d  move  this  over  here  so  that  its

one  unit  apart

ctrl  d  so  that  its  one  unit  apart

and  now  im  going  to  draw  a  box  going

around  these  three  thats  two  units

apart  so  let  me  go  back  to  the  bezier

pen

i  want  to  start  out  two  units  away  one

two

come  up  here  like  that  one  two

good  over  there

and  then  back  to  the  starting  point

lets  see  if  that  worked  okay  yeah  it

looks  like  i  got  that  right

all  right  so  now  what  i  will  do  is  i

will  round  the  corners  of  these  objects

here  so  let  me

grab  the  select  tool  let  me  select  this

object

add  a  new  path  effect  corners

go  to  the  nodes  tool  select  all  of  these

nodes  right  here

and  then  just  click  and  drag  them  in

like  that

let  me  turn  off  snapping  so  that  i  can

get  these  a  little  closer  to  each  other

without  them  getting  in  the  way

box  over  here

and  now  what  i  will  do  is  i  will  do  the

same  thing  to  this  object  right  here  so

let  me  click  on  that

add  a  path  effect  rounded

and  for  this  one  i  will  turn  snapping

back  on

maybe  right  about  there  that  looks

pretty  good  so  now  i want  to  grab  the

select  tool

click  and  drag  over  all  of  these  convert

these  to  pads  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  and  now  im  going  to

create  a  little  point  down  here  on  the

bottom  to  make  it  look  like  a  speech

bubble

so  let  me  grab  the  bezier  pen  again  im

going  to  come  in  over  here  a  little  bit

bring  this  down  to  about  here

and  then  bring  this  across  over  here

this  is  the  only  line  were  drawing

thats  not  going  according  to  the  grid

so  im  going to  bring  this  up  here  like

that  maybe  over  here  that  looks  good

and  then  back  to  the  starting  point  and

now  we  can  grab  the  select  tool  and

unify  those  two  together  by  holding

shift

and  clicking  on  the  object  next  to  it

and  go  to  path

union  and  now  its  one  shape  like  a

speech  bubble

now  much  like  we  did  with  the  phone  and

the  three-dimensional

drop  here  i  want  to  do  the  same  thing

only  going  that  way  so

let  me  take  this  object  first  i  want  to

color  this  in  actually

lets  take  these  three  circles  right

here  select  those  all  raise  those  to  the

top

and  then  fill  them  in  with  white

nothings  going  to  visually  change  on

the  canvas  because  the  canvas  background

is  white  so  you  have  a  white  object

against  a  white  background  so  it  doesnt

look  like  its  there  but  there  is  a

white  fill  there

let  me  get  rid  of  the  outline  by  holding

shift  and  pressing  x

over  here  in  the  bottom  left  corner  and

then  ill  take  this  and  ill  make  this

something  like

blue  or  green  or  yellow  or  whatever

whatever  color  you  want  to  make  it

ill  just  use  that  color  blue  get  rid  of

the  outline

shift  clicking  the  x  and  let  me

duplicate  this  by  pressing  ctrl  d

and  i  will  make  this  one  a  little  darker

like  that

maybe  even  use  an  off  shade  of  blue  like

that

bring  this  out  here  send  that  to  the

bottom  this  button  over  here  lower

selection  to  the  bottom

there  we  go  and  now  i  want  to  extrude

these  two  together  so  let  me  hold  shift

and  click  on  both  of  those

and  go  to  extensions  generate  from  path

extrude  and  click  apply

and  then  just  give  it  a  minute  to  do  its

thing  when  i  was  doing  this  tutorial

setting  it  up  before  it  took  a  while  for

this  to

load  but  this  time  it  went  nice  and

quick  so  thats  good  let  me  close  out  of

that

we  now  have  this  object  that  were

looking  for  let  me  ungroup  that  with  the

ungroup  button

and  again  i  want  to  keep  this  object

over  here  thats  connecting  these  two

points  together  i  want  to  keep  this

object  over  here

and  i  want  to  keep  this  object  over  here

and  i  want  to  delete  the  rest  of  them  so

ill  hold  shift

click  that  object  to  deselect  it  hold

shift

click  that  object  to  deselect  it  and

then  come  over  here  hold  shift

click  that  object  deselect  it  and  all  we

have  selected  now  are  the  objects  we

want  to  get  rid  of  so  now  you  can  press

delete  on  the  keyboard  and  there  you  go

so  lets  take  these  objects  right  here

that  we  just  created  shift  click  each  of

them  so  we  have  all  three  selected

and  then  hold  shift  and  click  the

original  and  go  to  path

union  and  thats  exactly  what  were

looking  for  right  there  a  three

dimensional

a  3d  style  isometric  chat  bubble

like  that  so  what  i  want  to  do  now  is

place  this  over  to  design  over  the

design  so

im  going  to  get  rid  of  im  going  to

temporarily  get  rid  of  the

isometric  grid  because  we  dont  need  it

anymore  were  done  drawing  objects  so

let  me  hold  shift  and  press  three  on  the

keyboard  to  get  rid  of  that

let  me  disable  snapping  for  now  so  that

doesnt  get  in  the  way

click  and  drag  over  this  whole  thing  and

press  ctrl  g

on  the  keyboard  and  place  it  over  the

object  over  here  like  that

ctrl  shift  to  scale  it  down  and  then  you

can  take  this  duplicate  it  bring  it  over

here

and  if  you  want  you  can  make  this  a

different  color

ungroup  it  ill  make  this  yellow

make  this  also  yellow  but  maybe  an  off

shade

maybe  like  red  like  that

and  then  finally  you  could  take  this  you

could  put  like  a  little  drop  shadow  down

here  by  duplicating  this  object

im  actually  going  to  duplicate  both  of

these  objects  the  light  gray  hold

shift  and  the  dark  gray  ctrl  d  to

duplicate

path  union  unify  them  together  make  this

black

hold  ctrl  and  just  click  and  drag  this

down  like  that  send  that  to  the  bottom

that  looks  pretty  good  and  bring  the

opacity  of  this  down

like  that  so  we  have  a little  bit  of  a

shadow  there  it  would  look  a  little  more

convincing  if  this  were  a  different

color  which  i  think  ill  do  that  now

ill  make  this

ill  make  this  something  like  purple

ill  make  this  a  lighter  shade  of  that

purple

and  then  ill  make  these  ones  white

or  you  know  what  and  ill  use  the  same

shade  as  that  purple

and  then  this  ill  make  this  a  darker

purple  as  well  im  just  using  the

keyboard  shortcuts  to  toggle  back  and

forth  between  the  dropper  the  dropper

tool  is

the  letter  d  on  the  keyboard  and  the

select  tool  is  s

so  i  just  like  to  toggle  back  and  forth

between  those  let  me  make  that  little

darker

thats  looking  good  maybe  add  some  more

saturation  to  that

that  right  there  is  what  im  looking  for

come  over  here  make  this  now  i  can  make

this  a  little  darker  so  its  a little

more  convincing

and  id  say  that  looks  good  enough  so  i

think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go  about

creating  these  simple

isometric  drawings  with  rounded  corners

using  some  of  the  new  features  in

inkscape  version  1.0
