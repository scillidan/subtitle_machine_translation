lets  go  over  how  you  can  save  an  object

with  a  transparent  background  using

inkscape  the  first  thing  youll  want  to

do  is  create  a  selection  around  the

object  youd  like  to  save  so  Im  going

to  click  on  this  grouping  of  objects

right  here  and  for  this  demonstration

Im  going  to  save  this  icon  with  a

transparent  background  once  you  have

your  selection  enabled  open  up  the

export  menu  by  going  to  file  and

selecting

export  from  the  export  menu  make  sure

you  have  the  selection  tab  enabled  and

come  down  here  to  this  little  thumbnail

preview  that  shows  you  a  preview  of

whats  going  to  be  saved

now  if  you  just  want  your  selection  to

be  saved  with  a  transparent  background

and  nothing  else  make  sure  to  click  this

button  right  here  that  says  export

selection  only  and  once  you  do  that

youll  notice  the  background  there

changes  to  a  checkerboard  pattern

indicating  transparency  if  you  dont

have  this  option  selected  its  going  to

export  everything  within  the  bounding

box  of  the  selection  here  which  is  what

I  dont  want  so  Im  going  to  enable  that

again  and  now  to  save  this  Im  going  to

click  on  this  folder  icon  down  here  to

choose  a  location  on  my  hard  drive  to

save  it  to  before  you  do  that  though

come  over  here  to  this  drop  down  and

make  sure  you  choose  portable  Network

graphic  or  PNG  PNG  is  the  file  format

that  supports  transparency  once  you  do

that  click  on  the  folder  choose  a  name

for  your  document  Im  just  going  to  name

this  icon  and  then  Im  going  to  click

save  and  if  you  navigate  over  to  the

section  on  your  hard  drive  where  you

have  saved  your  file  you  should  see  your

PNG  has  been  saved  there  with  a
