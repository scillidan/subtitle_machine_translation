in  a  video  that  I  uploaded  last  week

discussing  some  of  the  differences

between  illustrator  and  inkscape  one  of

the  items  that  I  pointed  out  was  that  in

inkscape  you  dont  have  the  ability  to

generate  charts  and  graphs  like  you  can

in  illustrator  but  it  turns  out  I  spoke

too  soon  on  that  one  as  a  commenter

pointed  out  there  is  an  extension  in

inkscape  that  allows  you  to  do  this  and

although  it  is  pretty  rudimentary  it

does  work  well  enough  so  lets  go  over

how  to  use  this  extension

Im  going  to  open  up  a  new  document  and

to  access  this  extension  were  going  to

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  extensions

were  going  to  go  down  to  render

and  the  item  were  looking  for  is  nice

charts

and  in  this  menu

if  you  come  over  here  to  where  it  says

data  you  can  see  we  have  two  different

types  of  data  that  we  can  input  we  can

choose  data  from  a  file  I  havent  tried

this  myself  but  apparently  you  can

import  data  from  a  CSV  file  if  youd

like  and  then  over  here  we  have  direct

input  which  is  were  going  to  be

focusing  on  for  this  lesson

now  this  is  where  things  get  a  little

complicated  if  you  come  down  here  to

this  text  input  box  youll  see  this  is

how  we  go  about  adding  items  to  our

chart  so  every  item  that  you  add  has  to

have  a  name  here  like  Ive  done  Ive

written  in  Sample  item  and  then  add  a

colon  and  then  the  number  representing

the  percentage  of  that  chart  and  then

add  a  comma  separating  it  from  the  next

item

so  its  kind  of  like  writing  code  here

youre  gonna  have  to  write  this  for  each

one  of  the  items  that  you  want  in  your

chart  and  if  youre  using  the  percentage

pie  chart  like  Im  using  youre  going  to

want  to  make  sure  that  these  numbers  add

up  to  100.

so  Im  going  to  move  this  menu  off  to

the  side  and  Im  going  to  tick  the  live

preview  box

and  its  going  to  show  you  a  preview  of

what  gets  generated  here

so  if  I  come  down  here  to  the  chart  type

drop  down  you  can  see  we  have  four

different  types  of  charts  that  we  can

choose  from  if  I  choose  bar  chart

we  get  something  like  this  right  here  if

I  choose  pie  chart  we  get  the  regular

pie  chart

if  we  choose  pie  chart  percentage  it

gives  you  the  same  pie  chart  but  with

the  numbers  having  a  percentage  symbol

after  them

and  then  finally  we  have  stacked  bar

chart  down  here  which  looks  like  that

so  Im  going  to  go  back  to  pie  chart

percentage

and  if  you  come  over  here  to  the  labels

tab  we  have  some  options  that  we  can

work  with  you  can  change  the  font  if

youd  like  you  can  change  the  font  size

and  you  could  change  the  font  color  now

the  problem  with  using  this  menu  is  that

if  you  want  to  change  the  color  youre

going  to  have  to  manually  type  in  the

hex  code  and  if  you  want  to  change  the

font  youll  have  to  manually  type  in  the

font  name  here  so  maybe  this  menu  isnt

the  best  way  to  go  about  doing  this  once

youre  finished  generating  the  chart  you

can  go  and  do  all  of  that  retroactively

using  the  text  tool  in  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  so  thats  probably  a  much

easier  way  to  do  that  so  Im  going  to

ignore  this  part  of  the  menu  and  Ill

come  over  here  to  the  charts  tab

and  if  you  notice  we  have  some  more

options  that  we  can  work  with  more

specifically  we  have  the  color  scheme

that  we  can  change  if  I  click  on  this

drop  down  right  here  I  can  choose  a  blue

color  scheme  which  looks  like  that  I  can

choose  gray  which  looks  like  that

and  then  we  have  contrast  and  then  we

have  sap

so  thats  what  those  options  look  like

Im  going  to set  this  back  to  default

again  this  would  probably  be  easier  to

change  after  we  generate  the  chart  so

Im  going  to  leave  that  as  it  is  for  now

and  then  over  here  we  can  add  or  remove

a  drop  shadow  so  this  is  what  it  looks

like  with  the  drop  shadow  added  beneath

the  chart  if  I  deselect  that  we  just

have  a  flat  chart  as  you  can  see  there

and  then  finally  Ill  come  over  here  to

the  values  tab  now  the  values  represent

the  numbers  after  the  item  name  so  if

you  dont  want  those  numbers  being

displayed  there  you  can  just  untick  that

box  and  then  those  values  will  be

removed

so  Im  going  to  put  them  back  on  there

and  once  youre  finished  you  can  just

click  the  apply  button  and  then  close

out  of  the  menu  and  now  you  have  a  pie

chart  that  you  can  work  with  and  you  can

click  on  these  items  individually  and

change  their  colors  like  any  other

Vector  object  as  you  see  me  doing  here

and  if  you  want  to  change  the  font  of

the  text  you  just  grab  your  text  tool

um  if  you  could  find  it  Im  just  going

to  press  the  letter  t  on  the  keyboard  to

access  it  and  you  can  just  triple  click

your  text  to  select  it  and  choose  a  new

font  using  the  text  menu  if  youd  like

so  thats  how  you  can  go  about

generating  charts  and  graphs  using  the

nice  charts  extension  in  inkscape

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all

theres  no  monthly  membership  fees  you

just  pay  17  one  time  and  youre  in  for

Life  Ill  have  some  information  about
