in  previous  tutorials  ive  gone  over  a

method  of  duplicating  objects  around  a

circle  where  an  object  is  rotated  and

stamped  in  multiple  places

this  is  a  really  useful  technique  for

any  inkscape  user  to  know  and  ive  had  a

lot  of  people  ask  me  how  to  do  something

like  this  in  the  past

so  i  feel  like  this  deserves  a  video  of

its  own



this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  stamp  an

object  around  a  circle  using  inkscape

but  before  we  get  started  if  youd  like

to  learn  more  about  inkscape  be  sure  to

check  out  the  inkscape  master  class  its

a  collection  of  over  60  videos  where  i

go  over

all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  i  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  on  inkscape

the  first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  just

set  up  the  document  so  that  we  are  all

working  with  a  similar

layout  up  here  where  it  says  view  make

sure  you  have  custom  selected

and  then  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

zoom  and  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

and  to  get  us  started  here  as  you  can

see  i  have  this  example  object

just  for  demonstrative  purposes  you

dont  have  to  use  this  object  you  can

use  whatever  object  youd  like  if  you

want  to  follow  along  you  can  use  a

circle  or  a  star  or  a  letter  or  whatever

youd  like

so  if  you  zoom  in  on  this  object  over

here  im  just  going to  hold  ctrl  and

roll  up  the  mouse  wheel  to  zoom  in

i  have  this  object  selected  with  the

select  tool  and  by  default  it  gives  us

the  scaling  handles  over  here  that

allows  us  to  scale  the  image

but  if  you  click  on  the  object  again

youll  get  the  rotation  handles  which

allows  us  to  rotate  the

image  or  the  object  around  a  center

point

and  the  center  point  is  located  right

here  it  may  be  difficult  for  you  to  see

on  my  screen  but  its  this  little

crosshair  right  here

this  represents  the  axis  on  which  the

object  rotates  and  you  can  actually  move

that  around  if  you  take  this  and  move

this  over  here  to  the  side

youll  notice  that  now  the  object

rotates  around

that  that  point  right  there  now  let  me

undo  that  by  pressing  ctrl  z

and  you  can  take  this  center  point  and

move  this  anywhere  you  can  move  this  all

the way  out  here  if  you  want  to

and  now  itll  rotate  around  that  axis

okay  so  and  if  at  any  point  if  you  want

to  put  the  rotation  center

back  in  the  middle  of  the  object  all  you

have  to  do  is  hold  shift  and  click  on  it

and  itll  place  it  right  back  in  the

middle

so  if  you  wanted  to  take  this  object  and

duplicate  it  around  a  circle

we  can  take  advantage  of  this  feature

right  here  so  let  me  zoom  out  a  little

bit  im  going to  hold  ctrl  and  roll  down

the  mouse  wheel

im  going  to  take  this  little  crosshair

and  im  going  to  bring  this  down  here

but  im  going to  hold  ctrl  so  it  locks

it  onto  the  vertical  axis

we  want  to  come  straight  down  like  this

all  the  way  down  here

now  what  you  can  do  is  you  can  take  this

rotation

handle  on  the  corner  here  and  rotate

this  around  in  a  circle

and  to  create  duplicate  copies  of  this

what  you  can  do

is  as  youre  rotating  it  you  can  press

the  space  bar

and  every  time  you  press  the  space  bar

itll  stamp  a  copy  of  it

as  you  see  happening  on  my  screen  now

let  me  go  ahead  and  undo  that

if  you  want  to  take  this  object  and

rotate  it  in  such  a  way  that  you  create

a  symmetrical  shape

with  each  with  each  individual  object

being  equally  spaced  apart

what  you  can  do  is  while  youre  rotating

hold  the  ctrl  key  and  it  will  lock  the

rotation  onto  15  degree  increments

so  you  can  start  here  go  there

there  and  as  you  see  i  am  creating  a

symmetrical  shape

where  this  object  is  being  stamped

around  a  circle

okay  so  lets  say  you  want  to  take  this

shape  and  wrap  it  around

a  circle  that  has  a  predetermined  size

so  let  me  move  this  out  of  the  way

lets  create  a  circle  here  the  circles

and  ellipses  tool  im  going  to  click  and

drag  hold  ctrl  to  create  a  perfectly

round  circle

lets  say  you  have  a  circle  like  this

and  lets  say

its  sized  at  let  me  just  change  the

size  to  200  pixels  lets  say  you  want  to

wrap  this  around  a  200  pixel  circle

what  you  can  do  is  you  can  take  this

object  here  let  me  get  rid  of  these

objects

you  can  take  this  object  here  select  it

hold  shift  click  on  this  object  here  the

circle

and  lets  open  up  the  alignment  menu

over  here  where  it  says  align  and

distribute  objects

and  i  want  to  make  sure  i  have  last

selected  chosen  from  this  drop  down

and  where  i  want  to  align  it  is  right

here  where  it  says

align  bottom  edges  of  objects  to  the  top

edge  of  the  anchor  so  its  going  to

stack  it  right  on  top  of  the  circle

and  then  i  want  to  center  it  up  on  the

vertical  axis  so  its  going  to  put  it  in

the  center

of  this  object  and  its  going  to  put  it

on  the  top  of  this  object  like  this

now  let  me  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything  let  me  zoom  in  a  little  bit

so  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want  to  take

this  object  and  wrap  it  around  this

circle

so  what  i  want  to  do  is  take  the  center

point  or  that  cross  hair  for  this  object

and  place  it  in  the  center

of  the  circle  and  the  way  to  do  that  to

make  sure  that  its  exactly  in  the

center  of  the  circle  what  you  could  do

is  you  could  turn  on  snapping  up  here

where  it says  enable  snapping  turn  that

on  if  its  not  on  already

and  over  here  what  were  looking  for

snap  centers  of  objects  click  on  that

snap  and  items  rotation  center  we  want

to  click  on  that  we  want  to  make  sure

this  is  the  important  one  right  here

snap  and  items  rotation  center

this  will  make  it  so  that  when  you  grab

that  little  crosshair  it  will  snap  it

into  the  center  of  the  object  you  place

it  over

so  let  me  click  on  this  again  to  get

back  to  the  rotation  handles  and  theres

the  center  point

as  it  already  is  let  me  just  shift-click

that  to  put  that  back  in  the  center

as  if  we  were  starting  fresh  now  im

going  to  take  this  crosshair  and  im

going  to  snap  it  into  the  center  of  the

circle

and  if  you  notice  it  automatically  snaps

it  right  into  the  center  there

and  what  you  can  do  now  is  you  can

rotate  this  around  you  can  hold  ctrl

and  go  through  and  stamp  this

and  again  at  each  position  you  just

press  the  spacebar  and  its  stamping  it

around  the  circle  like  that

and  that  should  do  it  for  todays

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

duplicating  objects  around  a  circle

using  inkscape

if  you  have  any  questions  let  me  know

and  as  always  thanks  for  watching
