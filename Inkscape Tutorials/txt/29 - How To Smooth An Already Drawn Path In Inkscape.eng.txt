in  a  previous  lesson  we  went  over  how

you  can  use  the  various  Tools  in

inkscape  to  draw  straight  lines  and

curved  lines  but  what  if  you  have  a  line

thats  already  drawn  and  you  just  want

to  smooth  it  out  like  you  see  here

thats  what  well  be  addressing  in

todays  tutorial  so  lets  get  started  so

for  this  demonstration  Im  just  going  to

draw  a  quick  and  sloppy  line  using  the

freehand  lines  tool  which  is  located

over  here  in  the  toolbar  or  you  can

access  it  by  pressing  the  letter  P  on

your  keyboard

Im  going  to  come  up  here  to  the

smoothing  setting  and  bring  that  all  the

way  down  to  zero  and  then  Im  going  to

click  and  drag  on  my  canvas  to  draw  a

really  rough  sloppy  line  like  that

now  if  I  go  to  the  nodes  tool  you  can

see  over  here  theres  a  lot  going  on  in

the  way  of  nodes

and  you  can  see  here  we  have  a  little

bit  of  a  uh  like  a  hard  corner  right

there  thats  okay  though  because  we  can

salvage  this  path  lets  go  to  the  pathfx

menu  by  going  to  path  and  selecting

pathfx

from  the  pathfx  menu  click  the  plus  icon

down  here  in  the  bottom  left  corner  to

add  a  new  path  effect

the  path  effect  were  looking  for  is

called  simplify  so  scroll  through  your

list  here  and  look  for  simplify  or  you

can  type  it  into  the  search  bar  up  here

Im  going  to  click  on  this  checkbox

right  here  to  add  this  path  effect  and

once  thats  added  all  you  have  to  do  is

come  down  here  to  where  it  says  roughly

threshold  and  increase  that  value  so  Im

going  to  hold  a  click  over  this  plus

icon  here  and  depending  on  how  rough

your  path  is  you  may  have  to  use  a

higher  value  so  Im  going  to  hold  a

click  over  this  for  a  while  and  if  you

notice  as  I  do  that  it  is  slowly  but

surely  becoming  a  smoother  path

now  if  I  want  to  increase  it  increase

this  even  more  I  can  come  over  here  to

where  it  says  steps  and  start  increasing

that  as  well  until  I  get  an  even

smoother  path

so  every  path  will  be  different  but

based  on  your  drawing  you  may  have  to

use  a  higher  or  lower  value  here  so  Im

going  to cycle  through  the  options  and

see  what  looks  best  I  think  10  looks

good  right  about  there  and  this  value

looks  good  as  well  so  Im  going  to  leave

this  just  as  it  is

so  as  you  can  see  we  now  have  a  much

smoother  path  and  this  is  a  temporary

effect  if  I  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  simplify  I  can  toggle  the

visibility  of  this  off  and  on  to  get

back  to  my  original  path

if  I  want  to  finalize  this  effect  I  can

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  path  and

go  to  object  to  path  now  if  you  notice

here  although  the  line  is  a  lot  smoother

its  not  quite  perfect  theres  a  little

bit  of  hard  Corners  in  here  but  thats

okay  because  we  can  iron  those  out

manually  lets  come  over  here  to  the

edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  and  if  you

notice  if  you  click  on  this  node  right

here  where  we  have  a  corner  we  have

these  two  handles  coming  off  the  sides

of  it  in  order  for  this  path  in  order

for  this  node  to  be  smooth  we  need  these

handles  to  be  running  parallel  with  each

other  so  Im  going  to  move  these  handles

so  that  theyre  parallel  with  each  other

and  we  have  a  smooth  path  here  a  quicker

way  to  do  that  would  be  to  just  hold

Ctrl  and  click  on  the  Node  and  itll

make  them  automatically  smooth  like  that

and  then  you  can  just  move  the  handles

around  like  that  to  adjust  it  as  needed

Ill  come  over  here  and  do  the  same

thing  Ill  hold  Ctrl  and  click  on  the

Node

and  again  you  can  click  on  the  Node

again  and  adjust  the  handles  as  needed

and  Ill  just  go  through  here  and  adjust

all  of  these  nodes  to  ensure  that  they

are  all  smooth  and  they  all  look  the  way

I  want  them  to  look

and  as  I  do  so  I  will  adjust  the  handle

so  I  have  the  right  Contour  that  I

prefer

now  we  have  smoothed  out  that  path  so

thats  how  you  can  smooth  out  a  rough

path  using  inkscape  if  you  found  this

lesson  useful  then  consider  checking  out

my  inkscape  master  class  its  a

collection  of  over  60  videos  where  I  go

over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  kind  of  like

how  I  did  in  this  video  we  even  have  a

private  Community  where  you  can  ask

questions  and  get  help  from  me  anytime

you  want  and  best  of  all  theres  no

monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay  17

one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching
