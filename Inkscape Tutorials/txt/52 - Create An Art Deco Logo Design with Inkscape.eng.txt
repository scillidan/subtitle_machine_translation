this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this  vintage  style  logo

design

using  inkscape  in  order  to  follow  along

with  this  tutorial  though  you  will  need

to  download  and  install  the  font  that  i

used  for  the  word  design  here  its

called  festival  bedai

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  so  go  ahead  and  download  and

install  that  font  before

launching  inkscape  and  then  well  be

good  to  go  before  we  get  started  though

if  youd  like  to  learn  more  about  how

inkscape  works  be  sure  to  check  out  my

inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  through  every  single  tool  and

feature  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  it  is  and  i

demonstrate  how  it  works  ill  have  some

information  about  that

in  the  description  of  the  video  if  you

want  to  check  that  out

so  well  go  ahead  and  get  started  here

in  inkscape  the  first  thing  i  want  to  do

is  just  set  up  the  document  i  want  to

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  view

make  sure  you  have  custom  selected  lets

go  to  zoom  lets  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

and  then  im  going  to  turn  off  snapping

up  here  in  the  top  left  corner  and  then

im  going  to  open

up  the  um  the  document  properties  menu

to  get  rid  of  this  page  border  and

change  the  unit  of  measurement  here  so

ill  go  to

file  document  properties  and  it  should

open  up  over  here  on  the  side

display  units  im  going  to  change  that

to  pixels  and  im  going  to

turn  off  the  visibility  of  the  page

border  which  is  over  here

so  now  we  can  close  out  of  document

properties  lets  open  up  the  fill  and

stroke  menu  which  is  over  here  the  edit

objects  colors  gradients  and  stroke  menu

if  you  click  on  that

or  a  keyboard  shortcut  you  can  just

press  ctrl  shift  and  f  and  thatll  open

it  as  well

so  the  first  thing  im  going  to  do  is

create  the  text  so  lets  grab  the  text

tool

which  is  if  i  could  find  it it  should  be

over  here  im  used  to  using  these

keyboard  shortcuts  so  i  sometimes  get

lost  over  here  in  the  sidebar  so

let  me  just  type  in  design  as  i  did  for

the  thumbnail  here  if  you  notice  i  have

the  word  design  as  the

primary  text  im  going  to  change  the

font  of  that

im  going  to  go  to  text  text  and  font

and  im  going  to  look  for  the  font  that

i  installed  called  festival  badaya

click  apply  and  there  you  go  there  you

have  the  text  now  we  can  close  out  of

the  text  menu

im  going  to  grab  the  select  tool  and

im  going  to  scale  this  up  and  im  just

going  to  hold  ctrl  while  i  do  that  to

make  sure  it  locks  the  proportions  like

that

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  convert

this  to  a  path  and  ungroup  it  so  ill  go

to  path

object  to  path  and  then  go  to  object

and  were  looking  for  ungroup  and  im

going  to  bring  down  the  opacity  of  this

roughly  in  half  now  you  have  to  have  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  open  in  order  to  do

this  so  make  sure  you  have  that  opened

im  going to  bring  down  the  opacity

roughly  in  half  and  now  i  want  to  move

these  letters  a  little  closer  together

so  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  im  going  to  zoom  in  by  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel

click  off  of  the  graphic  to  deselect

everything  and  im  going to  take  this

letter  d  and  im  just  going  to  move  this

closer  but  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  while

i  do  that  to  lock  it  onto  the  horizontal

axis  like  that

and  then  im going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  the  letter  e  so  i  have  both  of

these  letters  selected

hold  ctrl  move  this  closer  now  i

understand  that  the  letter  s

here  is  overlapping  with  the  letters  but

thats  okay  in  fact  thats  kind  of  the

point  of  the  design  im  going  to  be

incorporating  that  into  the  design  here

as  you  can  see  so  im  going  to  hold

shift  click  on  the  letter  s  so  we  have

all  three  of  these  letters  selected

and  to  move  your  view  around  like  this

to  move  the  page  you  can  just  press  down

the  mouse  wheel  and  move  the  mouse

let  me  move  these  over  while  holding

control  to  lock  the  proportions

and  then  just  do  the  same  thing  for  the

rest  of  the  word  just  go  ahead  and  bring

these  letters  in

like  that  and  now  i  will  press  one  on

the  keyboard  to  zoom  back  out  to  100

so  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  going

to  create  this  shape  in  the  background

here  this  emblem  so  let  me

go  back  into  inkscape  and  im  going  to

grab  the  squares  and  rectangles  tool

which  is  over  here

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  like

this  to  create  a  nice  vertical  rectangle

going  through  the  word  like  that  you

want  to  make  sure  you  have  sharp  corners

up  here  if  your  if  your  corners  are

rounded  just  go  ahead  and  click  this

corner  button  up  here  to  make  the

corners  sharp

and  now  i  will  grab  these  circles  and

ellipses  tool  and  i  will  click  and  drag

to  create  any  lips  going  through  that

rectangle  kind  of  like  that

now  if  you  notice  what  im  doing  here

im  going  to  take  the  intersecting  area

between  those  two  shapes

in  order  to  create  this  shape  right  here

so  to  do  that

first  let  me  make  sure  i  have  them

aligned  im  going  to  grab  the  select

tool  im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click

on  the  rectangle  so  i  have  them  both

selected

and  then  ill  open  up  the  align  and

distribute  menu  which  is

over  here  or  you  can  press  ctrl  shift

and  a

and  i  want  to  have  the  relative  set  to

last  selected

and  im  going  to  center  it  up  on  the

vertical  axis  and  then  ill  go  to

path  intersection  and  there  we  go  now  we

have  that

shape  now  dont  worry  about  this  shape

being  too  big  or  too  small  were  going

to  change  that  later  on

so  im  going  to  place  this  right  about

here  in  fact  what  i  want  to  do  is  i  want

to  click  and  drag  over  the  text

right  here  to  select  the  text  items

click  and  drag  over  just  the  text  not

the  whole

shape  just  the  text  itself  and  go  to

object

group  and  then  i  want  to  click  and  drag

over  everything

just  to  make  sure  i  have  this  aligned

vertically  im  going  to  click  on  uh

center  on  vertical  axis  right  there  and

then  click  off  to  deselect

everything  now  what  i  could  do  is  i

could  take  this  im  going  to  hold  ctrl

and  shift  and  either  scale  it  up  or

scale  it  down  whatever  you  want  to  do

whatever

whatever  you  need  to  do  to  make  it  fit

the  design  better  i  like  how  this  looks

right  about  here

im  going  to  grab  the  edit  paths  by

nodes  tool  im  going  to  click  and  drag

over  these  top  nodes  right  here  and  then

just  bring  them  down

by  holding  ctrl  and  just  click  and

dragging  them  down  like  that

there  we  go  now  lets  go  back  to  the

select  tool  lets  make  this  thing  into

an  outline  rather  than  a  solid  fill  so

lets  remove  the  fill  color  by  clicking

on  this  little  red  x  down  here  in  the

bottom  left  corner

and  then  give  this  a  black  stroke  by

holding  shift  and  clicking  on  the  color

black  over  there

now  the  thickness  of  this  will  vary  uh

you  can  change  that  by  coming  over  here

to  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

im  going  to  tap  im  going  to  click  on

stroke  style

and  i  want  this  to  be  about  15  looks

pretty  good

now  whatever  it  is  that  you  make  the

thickness  of  your  stroke  be

make  sure  you  make  a  mental  note  of  what

that  is  because  were  going  to  were

going  to  need  that  number  in  just  a

minute  so

15  is  for  this  first  one  right  here  now

well  go  to

path  stroke  to  path  path

uh  break  apart  and  then  go  to

path  difference

oops  that  was  a  mistake  let  me  undo  that

edit  undo  difference

and  then  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything  and  then  take  this  larger

shape  right  here

send  that  to  the  back  by  pressing  this

button  over  here  that  says  lower

selection  to  the  bottom

and  then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

smaller  shape  right  there  and  go  to

path  difference  so  that  you  end  up  with

this  shape  right  here  that  is  a

path  and  not  a  stroke  now  lets

duplicate  this  lets  press  ctrl  d  on  the

keyboard  to  make  a  duplicate  copy  of

this

go  to  path  uh  break  apart

and  well  go  to  path  union

and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going to  make  this  red  and  im  going  to

give  this  a  red  outline  by  holding  shift

and  clicking  on  the  color  red  like  that

and  im  going  to  make  this  outline  a

little  bigger  im  going  to make  this

maybe

10.  this  is  going  to  represent  the  space

between  the  two  borders  here  if  you

notice  we  made  this  first  border  already

now  were  going  to  make  this  second

border  this  red  object  is  going  to

represent  the  space  between  those  two

borders

so  let  me  go  back  in  there  and  finish

this  up  let  me  change  this  make  this  a

little  bigger

you  hold  the  plus  icon  to  make  that

bigger  like  that

thats  looking  pretty  good  now  when

youre  doing  this  i  probably  should  have

noted  over  here  where  it  says  join  make

sure  you  have  a  square  join  you  dont

want  a  rounded  join  like  that  you  want

it  to  be  nice  and  square  so  you  get

those  square  corners

maybe  ill  make  that  a  little  bit  bigger

and  ill  do  this  again  ill  go  to

path  stroke  to  path  path

break  apart  if  i  can  find  it  there  it  is

go  to  object  ungroup  and  then  go  to

path  union  now  were  going  to  do  this

one  more  time  im  going  to  add  a  smaller

stroke  over  here  now  this  stroke  right

here  was  15  pixels  im  going  to  make

this  one  a  little  bit  smaller  so  im

going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

color  black  to  give  that  an  outline

lets  click  the  red  x  to  get  rid  of  the

red  fill  and  im  going  to  make  this

something  smaller  than  15.  maybe

something  like  10.

that  right  there  looks  pretty  good  now

again  we  want  to  make  sure  we  have

squared

a  square  join  a  squared  cap  like  that

and  id  say  thats  looking  pretty  good

right  here  now  again  you  want  to  make  a

mental  note  of  this  so  for  this  one  i

used  15  for  this  one  i  used  10.

lets  go  to  path  stroke  to  path  and

there  we  go

now  we  can  click  off  of  that  to  deselect

everything  so  lets  start  working  on

these  little  um

horizontal  bars  going  across  the  design

right  here  well  do  that  next

to  do  that  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going  to  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool

im  going  to  click  and  drag  to  create  a

rectangle  going  through  the  design  right

here

and  i  want  to  get  rid  of  that  outline

im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

red

x  and  im  just  going  to  give  that  a

black  fill  by  clicking  on  black  right

there

and  this  is  where  were  going  to  have  to

remember  this  number  that  we  used  we

want  to  make  the  height  of  this  the  same

thickness  of  this  border  right  here  so

that  its  consistent  all  the  way  through

the  design

so  let  me  grab  the  select  tool  let  me

change  the  height  of  this  well  first  let

me  change  the  pixels

let  me  change  this  to  pixels  change  the

height  of  this  to  15.

there  we  go  move  this  over  here  a  little

closer  to  the  word

maybe  make  this  a  little  wider  you  can

go  ahead  and  adjust  the  size  of  this  as

needed

and  then  i  just  want  to  make  sure  that

this  is  aligned  on  the

vertical  axis  here  so  im  going  to  hold

shift  click  on  the  emblem  behind  it

come  back  up  here  to  the  line  distribute

menu  and  make  sure  you  have  it  centered

on  the  vertical  axis  like  that

and  now  click  off  of  the  deselect

everything  and  what  im  going to  do  now

is  im  going  to  take  this

shape  right  here  and  duplicate  that  by

pressing  ctrl  d

hold  ctrl  move  this  up  like  this  and

again  were  holding  ctrl  and  clicking

and  dragging  to  lock  it  onto  the  axis

like  that  so  it  doesnt  go

off  off  center  and  i  want  to  make  the

height  of  this  the  same  as  the  thickness

of  this  border  so  i  used  10  pixels  for

that  one  so  ill  make  this  one  10  pixels

high

and  there  you  go  now  im  just  going  to

zoom  in  let  me  just  zoom  in  a little  bit

whoops  and  i  just  want  to  make  sure  that

the  spacing  between  these  two  lines

is  about  equal  to  the  spacing  between

those  two  lines  if  you  want  you  can  be

meticulous  with  this  and  measurement

measure  it  if  you  want  im  just  gonna

im  just  gonna  leave  it  right  about

there  i  think  that  looks  close  enough

and  then  i  want  to  take  this  and  just

move  this  in  a little  bit  take  this

arrow  move  that  in

take  that  arrow  move  that  in  like  that

and  then  hold  shift  click  on  the

original  design  behind  it

and  then  just  make  sure  you  have  that

centered  like  that  now  we  can  click  off

of  the  graphic  to  deselect  everything

let  me  press  one  on  the  keyboard  to  zoom

back  out  to  100

and  now  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

just  those  two  rectangles  right  there

that  we  just

created  and  i  want  to  duplicate  them

ill  press  ctrl  d

hold  ctrl  move  these  ones  down  here

and  i  just  want  to  flip  them  vertically

i  could  you  can  click  on  this  button  up

here  that  says  flip  selected  objects

vertically  what  i  like  to  do  is  just

press  the  letter  v

on  the  keyboard  much  easier  and  once

youve  done  that  you  can  click  off  of

that

okay  so  if  you  notice  what  we  have  here

we  have  the  structure  of  the  design  in

place

now  we  just  have  to  go  through  and  uh

fix  some  of  the  spacing  issues  or  uh

finish  up  what  we  were  doing  here  as  far

as  the  spacing  goes  let  me  click  on  the

word  right  here  and  then  ungroup  those

letters  ill  go  to  object

ungroup  because  we  previously  had  those

letters  grouped  together  let  me  click

off  that  to  deselect  everything

and  now  i  want  to  delete  out  the  area  of

the  emblem  in  the  background  where  these

words  are  so  let  me  zoom  in  a  little  bit

let  me  grab  the  squares  and  rectangles

tool  im  going  to  create  a  rectangle

going  over  the  word  like  that  im  going

to  make  this  red  so  i  can  see  it  against

everything  else

and  if  you  notice  over  here  i  have  the

rectangle  let  me  grab  the  select  tool

i  have  the  rectangle  going  through  this

bar  right  here  at  the  at  the  top  and  i

have  it  going  through  this  bar

oops  i  have  it  going  through  this  bar

down  here  at  the  bottom

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  duplicate

that  by  pressing  ctrl  d

hold  shift  click  on  this  shape  go  to

path

difference  then  take  this  red  shape  hold

shift  click  on  this  object  out  here  and

go  to

path  difference

let  me  try  that  again  path  difference

there  we  go

and  now  i  just  want  to  delete  out  the

areas  of  this  bar  up  here  so  let  me  grab

the  rectangles  and  squares  tool  again

create  a  rectangle  going  through  here

like  this

grab  the  select  tool  hold  shift  click  on

that  object  to  go  to  path

difference  well  do  that  one  more  time

come  down  here  to  this  one

so  that  it  looks  the  same  on  the  bottom

as  it  does  on  the  top

hold  shift  click  on  that  go  to  path

i  dont  know  why  thats  not  working  half

the  time  but  there  we  go  now  its

working

okay  so  um  oh  you  know  what  i  made  a

mistake  here  let  me  just  edit  that

i  should  have  moved  that  in  a  little

more  there  we  go

okay  now  to  do  that  if  you  need  to  do

what  i  just  did  there  you  just  grab  the

nodes  tool  click  and  drag  over  those  two

nodes  you  can  just  move  them  in  and  out

like  that

you  can  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it  onto  the

horizontal  axis

there  we  go  all  right  so  now  lets  take

care  of  the  lettering  in  here  if  you

notice  i  have  the  letter  s

overlapping  everything  in  its  way  lets

go  ahead  and  create  that  right  now  so

let  me  grab  the  letter  s  right  here

let  me  create  a  duplicate  of  that  by

pressing  ctrl  d  and  im  going  to  make

this

green  and  im  going  to  give  this  a  green

stroke  so  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

press  on  green

again  and  im  going  to  come  over  here  to

the  fill  and  stroke  menu

stroke  style  and  im  just  going  to

increase  the  size  of  this

until  its  as  big  as  i  need  it  to  be

okay  so  i  want  this  to  be  big  enough

that  its  going  through

that  its  covering  the  tip  of  the  letter

e  here

like  that  but  at  the  same  time  i  dont

want  it  clipping  off  the  top  of  the  e

right  here  but  thats  okay  ill  fix  that

in  just  a  minute

okay  so  that  right  there  is  a  pretty

good  size  im  going  to  go  to  path

stroke  to  path  object

ungroup  and  then  path

union  and  now  what  i  will  do  is  i  will

im  going  to  cut  out  this  little  area

right  here  that  i  dont  want  let  me  grab

the  pen  tool  which  is

through  this  intersecting  area  right

here

go  back  to  the  select  tool  hold  shift

click  on  that  green  letter  and  go  to

path

will  do  is  i  will  take  this  green  letter

click  on  the  letter  e  right  here  and  go

to  path

but  im  just  gonna  for  this  for  this

demonstration  ill  just  put  some  stars

in  here  so  let  me  grab  the  stars  and

polygons  tool

from  the  settings  up  here  you  want  to

make  sure  you  have  star  selected  instead

of  polygon

five  corners  spoke  ratio  of  0.375

and  then  zeros  for  both  rounded  and

randomized  now  you  can  just  go  ahead  and

create  a  star  like  that

hold  ctrl  and  bring  your  cursor  up

straight  up  like  that  to  create

a  star  like  that  now  let  me  get  rid  of

the  the  green  stroke  around  there  by

holding  shift  and  clicking  on  the  red

x  let  me  make  this  black  grab  the  select

tool

hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  that  down

like  that  and  put  that

right  about  there

and  then  i  want  to  make  a  duplicate  of

that  im  going  to  press  ctrl  d

then  hold  ctrl  and  move  this  over  here

like  that  maybe  ill  make  this  one  a

little  smaller

bring  that  down  a  little  bit  ctrl  d  make

a  duplicate  of  that  hold  ctrl  move  that

over  like  that

and  then  select  all  three  of  those  stars

and  make  sure  that  theyre  spaced  apart

evenly  come  over  here  to  the

align  and  distribute  menu  and  were

looking  for  a  distribute  right  here

and  then  over  here  where  it  says  make

horizontal  gaps  between  objects  equal

click  on  that

and  now  you  can  just  group  that  all

together  by  going  to  object

group  and  then  you  could  press  you  could

hold  shift  on  the  keyboard  and  click

on  the  object  right  there  and  just  make

sure  you  have  that  centered

up  like  that  now  im  going  to  go  in  here

and  adjust  the  spacing  a little  bit  so

it  looks  a little  more  consistent  maybe

even  make  this  a  little  bigger

press  one  of  the  keyboard  to  zoom  back

out  to  100  and  as  you  can  see  we  are

done

so  that  is  how  you  can  go  about  creating

that  vintage  style

logo  design  using  inkscape  if  you  have
