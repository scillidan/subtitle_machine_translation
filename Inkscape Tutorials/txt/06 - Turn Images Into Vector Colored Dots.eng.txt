in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  use  inkscape  to  trace  an

image  into  a  series  of  individual  Vector

color  dots  and  to  show  you  what  I  mean

for  my  example  here  I  started  off  with

this  image  which  is  a  pixel-based  image

and  I  was  able  to  trace  a  series  of

vector  dots  that  all  have  a  single  fill

color  and  no  gradients  applied  which  is

what  Ill  be  showing  in  this  tutorial

before  we  get  started  though  if  youd

like  to  learn  more  about  inkscape  be

sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  we  even  have  a  private  Community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  any  time  you  want  Ill  have  some

information  about  that  down  below  if  you

want  to  check  that  out  so  to  get  started

Im  going  to  import  my  image  into

inkscape  and  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have

my  document  the  same  size  as  the  image

so  click  on  the  image  and  press  control

shift  R  if  you  havent  done  so  already

and  that  will  make  the  document  the  same

size  as  the  selected  image  now  lets

open  up  the  layers  menu  by  going  to

layer  and  selecting  layers  and  objects

and  I  want  to  make  sure  I  have  my  image

on  one  layer  by  itself  and  Im  going  to

add  another  layer  on  top  of  that  so  Ill

click  on  this  plus  icon  up  here  and  Im

going  to  name  this  layer  to  which  is  the

default  and  Ill  click

add  and  on  this  layer  I  want  to  create  a

circle  so  Im  going  to  zoom  into  the  top

left  corner  of  my  image  and  Im  going  to

grab  the  circles  and  ellipses  tool  and

Ill  click  and  drag  to  draw  a  circle  and

Ill  hold  the  control  key  while  doing  so

to  make  sure  I  can  draw  a  perfectly

round  circle  like  that  so  now  Ill  grabb

my  selection  tool  and  Ill  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  by  going  to  object

and  selecting  fill  and

stroke  and  Ill  come  over  here  to  the

fill  Tab  and  I  want  to  make  sure  I

choose  this  option  right  here  which  says

unset  paint  and  when  you  have  an  unset

paint  it  should  turn  black  by  default

and  what  that  will  do  is  itll  make  it

so  that  this  object  can  trace  all  of  the

objects  it  can  trace  the  objects  beneath

it  and  Sample  a  color  from  each  copy

that  we  create  so  let  me  take  this  and

put  this  in  the  top  left  corner  Im

going  to  open  up  the  aligned  distribute

menu  by  going  to  object  and  selecting

aligned

distribute  Ill  set  the  relative  two

make  sure  you  have  this  set  to  page  and

Im  going  to  align  this  on  the  top  Edge

and  the  left  Edge  and  Im  going  to  zoom

out  a  little  bit  just  as  a

comparison  Im  going  to  make  the

circle  about  that  big  you  can  eyeball  it

doesnt  have  to  be  a  specific  size  Ill

go  with  that  size  right  there  and  what

you  want  to  do  now  is  click  on  your

image  and  look  up  here  in  the  width  and

the  height  to  see  what  the  width  and

height  is  and  make  a  mental  note  of

whatever  that  is  so  my  image  is  872  by

1280  so  Ill  select  my  circle  now  and

with  the  circle  selected  I  will  go  to

edit  clone  create  tiled

clones  and  from  this  menu  I  want  to

choose  this  option  over  here  that  says

width  and  height  and  I  want  to  input  the

width  and  height  of  my  image  so  Im

going  to  write  872  by  1280

and  then  Ill  come  over  here  to  the

trace  tab  I  want  to  enable  tracing  and  I

want  to  enable  color  and  I  want  to  turn

off  everything  else  so  whatever  else  in

here  is  enabled  turn  that  off  we  only

want  Trace  color  and  color  and  width  and

height  and  once  thats  done  let  me  make

sure  I  have  my  object  selected  first

there  we  go  my  object  got  deselected

somehow  thats  important  you  got  to  have

your  object  selected  and  now  I  will  make

sure  I  have  everything  set  here  and  then

click  create  and  when  you  click  create

it  may  take  a  minute  or  two  to  load

because  its  pretty  CPU  intensive  mine

rendered  pretty  quick  though  so  as  you

can  see  the  tracing  has  completed  Im

going  to  click  the  x  button  to  get  out

of  this  menu  and  if  you  zoom  in  on  this

a  little  bit  you  can  see  the  individual

color  dots  that  were  traced  over  the

image  and  what  you  could  do  now  is  you

can  scale  them  down  if  you  want  so  if  I

were  to  select  this  dot  if  I  were  to

hold  my  ALT  key  or  if  youre  on  Mac  it

would  be  the  option  key  and  click  again

I  would  select  the  original  dot  on

underneath  it  and  I  would  scale  that

down  by  holding  control  and  shift  and

then  scaling  that  down  just  a  little  bit

and  the  rest  of  the  dots  scale  down  with

it  now  Im  going  to  turn  off  the

visibility  of  the  background  image  so

you  can  see  this  even  better  Ill  come

over  here  to  my  layers  menu  and  Ill

come  all  the  way  down  here  to  the  bottom

of  the  layers  menu  and  Im  going  to  turn

off  the  visibility  of  layer  one  and  you

can  now  see  if  you  zoom  out  you  can  see

the  image  better  but  what  Im  going  to

do  now  is  put  a  background  Behind  these

dots  so  you  can  see  it  better  so  Ill

grab  my  rectangle

tool  Ill  send  this  to  the  bottom  and

now  you  can  see  it  a  little  better  okay

so  if  I  zoom  in  you  can  see  each  dot

here  is  individually  colored  I  could

select  on  each  one  and  you  can  see  the

color  thats  applied  there  theres  no

gradients  here  each  dot  is  a  single

individual

color  and  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  trace  an

image  into  a  series  of  vector  colored

dots  using  inkscape
