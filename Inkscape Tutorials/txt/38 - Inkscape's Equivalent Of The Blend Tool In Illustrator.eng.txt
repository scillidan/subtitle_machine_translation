in  adobe  illustrator  theres  a  really

handy  tool  called  the  blend  tool  which

allows  you  to  make  lots  of  copies  of

objects  and  blend  them  together  in

creative  ways

inkscape  doesnt  have  such  a  tool  but  it

does  come  with  a  couple  of  extensions

that  when  used  in  tandem  can  mimic  the

function  of  illustrators  blend  tool  in

todays  tutorial  ill  be  showing  you  how



so  getting  us  started  here  in  inkscape

the  first  thing  were  going  to  have  a

look  at  is  the  scatter  extension  which

allows  you  to  take  a  single  object  and

repeat  it  along  a  path  as  many  times  as

youd  like  in  order  to  use  this

extension  were  going  to  need  a  path  to

place  our  object  on  so  for  this

demonstration  im  going  to  be  creating  a

spiral  you  can  create  whatever  path

youd  like  this  is  just  the  example  im

going  to  use  for  this  lesson

if  youd  like  to  follow  along  with  what

im  doing  just  go  ahead  and  pause  the

video  and  input  these  values  up  here

into  the  tool  settings  for  the  spiral

tool  and  then  well  be  good  to  get

started  once  thats  done  im  going  to

click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  like  that

to  create  my  spiral  and  that  right  there

represents  the  path  that  my  object  is

going  to  follow

so  now  i  have  to  actually  create  the

object  for  this  demonstration  ill  just

be  using  a  simple  circle  im  going  to

grab  the  circles  and  ellipses  tool  click

and  drag  on  the  canvas  and  then  hold

ctrl  to  ensure  that  its  a  perfectly

round  circle  like  that

and  im  going  to  give  this  a  gradient

just  to  help

demonstrate  this  effect  a  little  better

im  going  to  make  this  a  solid  fill

color  first  of  something  like  pink

and  then  im  going  to  apply  a  gradient

so  let  me  grab

the  fill  and  stroke  menu  which  is

located  up  here  or  you  can  press  ctrl

shift  and  f  on  the  keyboard  to  access  it

and  up  here  under  the  fill  tab  im  just

going  to  click  this  button  over  here

that  says  linear  gradient  and  as  you  can

see  right  here  we  now  have  a  linear

gradient  on  this  object  so  this  half  of

the  circle  is  pink  i  want  to  make  this

half  a  different  color  so  let  me  click

on  this  handle  right  here  and  im  going

to  change  this  color  to  something  else

im  going  to  use

a  lighter  shade  of  blue  like  that

and  now  im  going  to  take  the  handles  of

this  gradient  and  just  move  this  like

this  im  going  to  put  this  one  up  here

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it  onto

the  axis  so  we  have  a  nice  vertical

gradient  going  like  that

now  what  im  going  to  do  oh  by  the  way

to  zoom  in  and  out  hold  ctrl  roll  up  and

down  the  mouse  wheel

so  now  what  im  going  to do  is  im  going

to  grab  the  selection  tool

and  now  in  order  to  make  this  object

follow  along  this  path  we  have  to  make

sure  that  this  object  is  positioned

above  the  path  now

since  we  created  the  path  first  and  then

the  object  second  we  dont  have  to  worry

about  this  this  is  already  positioned

above  the  path  here  but  i  just  needed  to

point  that  out  in  case  youre  using  this

extension  in  other  ways  and  you  cant

figure  out  why  it  works

the  object  always  has  to  be  positioned

above  the  path  like  that  okay  and  you

can  change  the  positioning  over  here

using  these  up  and  down

you  can  lower  objects  raise  objects  see

right  now  the  path  is  above  the  object

which  is  no  good  we  want  this  to  be  on

top

okay  so  with  that  in  place  let  me  select

both  of  these  objects  and  im  going  to

go  to  extensions

generate  from  path

scatter  okay  so  now  the  the  settings  im

going  to  use  here

as  you  can  see  follow  path  orientation

check  stretch  spaces  to  fit  skeleton

link  uh  length  check

spaces  between  copies  im  going  to  start

off  with  negative  10

and  then  well  take  it  from  there  normal

offset  were  gonna  leave  that  at  zero

zero  cloned  and  randomly  were  gonna

leave  everything  as  it  is  here

and  what  im  gonna  do  once  i  have

negative  10  put  in  here  im  gonna  im

gonna  enable  the  live  preview

and  its  going  to  show  you  what  happens

here  its  going  to  show  you  the  object

being  repeated  along  the  path

now  if  you  notice  theres  lots  of

spacing  between  these  objects  we  want

the  spacing  to  be  decreased  so  we  can

have  more  objects  so  it  looks  more  like

a  solid  line  in  order  to  do  that  were

going  to  have  to  decrease  this  number

here  the  spaces  between  copies  im  going

to  start  off  with  negative  15.  we

started  out  with  negative  10  im  going

to  go  in  increments  of  5.  so  im  going

to  go  down  to  negative  15  now  and  see

how  that  looks

okay  so  that  looks  a  little  better  now

the  reason  why  im  going  in  increments

of  five  is  because  if  you  go  too  far  too

much  its  actually  going  to  lock  up  this

uh  its  gonna  lock  up  the  extension  and

its  not  gonna  work  youll  see  here  in

just  a  minute  let  me  try  negative  20  now

okay  thats  looking  a  lot  better  im

going  to  go  a  little  further  just  for

demonstration  purposes  here  lets  try

negative  25.

and  this  is  what  happens  right  here  you

get  this  error  message  this  means  that

youve  gone  too  far  for  the  for  your

object  and  theres  no  more  like  this  is

as  much  as  the  extension  can  do  now  this

morning  message  is  a  good  thing  here

because  a  few  years  ago  i  actually  made

a  video  demonstrating  how  to  use  this

extension  in  an  older  version  of

inkscape  and  once  you  go  too  far  what  it

used  to  do  is  it  used  to  crash  your

system  and  you  had  to  restart  everything

now  theyve  added  this  uh  fix  in  there

that  stops  it  from  crashing  so  were

going  to  go  ahead  and  click  ok  and  were

going  to  go  back  to  20  and  were  going

to  try  21  instead

okay  that  looks  good  lets  try  22.

and  thats  too  far  so  it  looks  like  21

is  the  max  im  going  to  set  it  to  21.

and  once  im  finished  im  going  to  click

ok  or  apply  and  then  close  and  there  you

go  it  generated  that  object  right  there

kind  of  like  how  the  blend  tool  works  in

adobe  illustrator

okay  now  if  you  zoom  in  on  this  you  can

see  it  just  consists  of  lots  of  tiny

individual  circles  you  may  be  able  to

see  some  of  the  color  banding  in  there

thats  because  this  is  a  bunch  of

individual  circles  okay  but  if  you  zoom

out

it  looks  nice  and  fluid  nice  and  smooth

like  that  so  now  lets  have  a  look  at

the  other  extension  in  inkscape  that

allows  you  to  perform  some  of  the

functions  that  the  blend  tool  does  in

illustrator  this  would  be  the

interpolate  tool  so  to  demonstrate  what

interpolate  does  let  me  create  a  text

object  im  going  to  grab  my  text  tool

im  going  to  click  on  the  canvas  right

here  and  im  going  to  type

blend  in  all  caps  im  going  to  triple

click  the  text  to  highlight  it  and  im

going  to  change  the  font  by  clicking  on

the  text  editor  up  here

and  the  font  im  using  for  this

demonstration  is  called  league

league  gothic  which  is  right  there

click  apply  and  there  we  go  let  me  get

out  of  this  menu  because  it  otherwise

slows  the  system  down  let  me  grab  the

selection  tool  now  let  me

make  this  larger  hold  ctrl  while  im

scaling  to  ensure  that  it  maintains  the

aspect  ratio

and  im  going  to  put  this  copy  over  here

maybe  ill  make  this  a  little  smaller  i

want  to  make  this

a  different  color  i  want  to  make  this

yellow

and  what  i  want  to  do  is  change  this

from  a  text  object  to  an  actual  path

otherwise  this  is  not  going  to  work  this

interpolate  extension  it  only  works  on

objects  that  are  paths  so  to  convert

this  to  a  path  ill  go  to  path  object  to

path

and  now  i  need  to  ungroup  it  ill  go  to

object

on  group

and  then  ill  unify  it  all  together  by

going  to  path

union

and  now  im  going  to  duplicate  this

object  by  right  clicking  it  going  to

duplicate

and  ill  make  this  one  bigger  im

holding  ctrl  while  im  scaling  here  to

maintain  the  aspect  ratio  and  ill  move

this  one  down  here

and  im  going  to  change  this  to  a

different  color  ill  go  with  pink

and  now  im  going  to  select  both  of

these  objects  at  the  same  time

go  to  extensions  generate  from  path  and

interpolate

now  the  settings  ill  be  using  here  as

you  can  see  the  exponent  is  one

interpolation  steps  this  is  the  number

of  copies  that  will  be  created  between

these  two  im  going  to  start  out  with

five  and  then  ill  take  it  from  there

and  these  settings  as  you  can  see  here

we  want  to  leave  these  settings  as  you

see  on  my  screen  and  once  youre  ready

click  live  preview

and  as  you  can  see  it  took  the  two

objects  and  created  five  copies  of  them

based  on  their  properties  now  as  you  can

see  these  copies  they  range  in  size  they

go  from  large  to  small  as  these  two

objects  did  and  then  the  color

transitions  as  well  as  you  can  see  there

so  if  i  could  actually  i  could  actually

increase  this  from  five  to  something

like  10

and  then  you  end  up  with  something  like

that  or  i  could  even  go  as  far  as  20

and  then  you  end  up  with  something  like

that

go  a little  further  30

now  its  looking  more  fluid  like  that

and  unlike  the  other  extension  i  dont

think  this  one  has  a  break  off  point

where  it  locks  up  and  closes  i  think  you

could  go  infinitely  with  this  so  thats

40.

heres  how  50  looks

and  there  you  go  i  think  you  should  get

the  idea  let  me  bring  this  back  down  to

something  a little  more  reasonable  like

10.

click  apply

and  then  close

and  then  once  youre  finished  as  you  can

see  here  it  created  new  copies  from  this

so  your  original  copies  are  still  there

in  place  you  dont  need  to  make

duplicates  you  dont  need  to  make  backup

copies  because  this  is  going  to  generate

a  new  copy  based  on  this  and  if  you  want

to  edit  this  further  you  can  just  go  to

object  on  group

and  now  as  you  can  see  this  consists  of

a  bunch  of  individual  objects  that  were

generated  using  that  extension

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

working  around  a  lack  of  the  blend  tool

in  inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson

useful  then  consider  checking  out  my

inkscape  master  class  its  a  collection

of  over  60  videos  where  i  go  over  all  of

the  tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  i

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  i  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

and  best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  17

one  time  and  youre  in  for  life  ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching
