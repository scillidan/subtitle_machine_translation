this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  todays  tutorial  Ill  be

demonstrating  how  you  can  create  these

double  exposure  logos  using  Inkscape  and

if  youd  like  to  learn  more  about  how

Inkscape  works  be  sure  to  check  out  the

Inkscape  master  class  which  is  a

collection  of  over  50  videos  where  I  go

over  all  of  the  tools  and  features  in

Inkscape  and  I  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work

Ill  put  a  link  in  the  description  if

you  want  to  check  that  out  so  Im  gonna

get  started  here  in  Inkscape  the  first

thing  we  want  to  do  is  just  set  up  our

documents  that  were  all  working  with

this  similar  workflow  Im  gonna  come  up

here  where  it  says  view  and  I  want  to

make  sure  we  have  custom  selected  and

then  Ill  zoom  go  to  zoom  zoom  in  at  1

to  1  and  then  I  want  to  open  up  the

align  and  distribute  menu  with  this

button  over  here  were  gonna  want  last

selected  chosen  from  that  drop-down  and

then  Ill  open  up  the  Edit  objects

colors  gradients  and  Stroke  menu  with

this  button  right  here  so  that  we  have

those  two  menus  open  now  what  were

gonna  do  is  were  going  to  import  some

graphics  from  from  pixabay  which  is  like

a  free  stock  photo  site  with  a  double

exposure  logo  youre  pretty  much  doing

is  youre  taking  two  different  objects

and  combining  them  together  into  one

object  now  let  me  show  you  what  I  mean

here  Im  gonna  open  up  this  website  here

Ill  have  a  link  to  all  of  this

information  in  the  description  of  the

video  Im  gonna  take  a  combination  of

this  like  this  silhouette  of  a  skyline

of  trees  here  and  combine  it  with  one  of

these  animals  here  for  the  thumbnail  I

use  the  bear  thats  what  Ill  be  using

in  this  tutorial  so  what  Im  gonna  do  is

Im  going  to  download  this  click  on  free

download  Im  gonna  choose  the  vector

graphic  the  SVG  download  that  let  me

minimize  this  and  just  click  and  drag

this  into  Inkscape  there  we  go  and  I

want  to  come  over  here  and  do  the  same

thing  download  this  the  SVG  download

there  we  go

click  and  drag  that  into  Inkscape  and

there  we  go  now  let  me  open  up  Inkscape

again  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  Im

gonna  hold  ctrl  and  roll  down  the  mouse

wheel  a  few  times  to  zoom  out  I  want  to

take  this  over  here  let  me  try

ungrouping  this  is  seeing  if  I  could

there  we  go  just  take  this  Im  gonna

work  with  this  one  with  this  one  animal

right  here  and  I  take  the  rest  of  these

and  press  Delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get

rid  of  them  and  what  Im  gonna  do  is  Im

gonna  take  these  objects  and  make  them

different  colors  and  bring  the  opacity

down  so  I  can  see  them  a  little  better

okay  so  Im  gonna  start  off  with  this

object  right  here  Im  gonna  make  this

red  bring  me  the  opacity  down  roughly

and

and  then  Ill  take  the  bear  Im  gonna

make  this  blue  and  Ill  bring  the

opacity  of  that  down  roughly  in  half  as

well  and  Im  gonna  flick  this

horizontally  actually  enough  where  it

says  up  here  flip  selected  objects

horizontally  Im  gonna  flip  that  over

there  and  Im  trying  to  position  the

bear  over  the  area  of  the  trees  where

Id  like  to  combine  it  and  Im  gonna

zoom  in  a  little  bit  by  holding  ctrl  and

rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel  if  you  want

to  move  the  page  around  you  just  press

down  the  mouse-wheel  and  move  the  mouse

Im  just  gonna  hold  ctrl  and  scale  this

up  a  little  bit  I  want  to  grab  a  sample

basically  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Im

gonna  take  the  bear  and  the  trees  and

Im  gonna  do  a  path  intersection  between

the  two  of  them  and  its  gonna  create  an

object  that  combines  the  two  of  these

shapes  right  here  but  when  I  do  that

its  gonna  cut  out  the  tops  of  the  trees

here  because  thats  extending  further

than  where  the  bear  is  but  I  want  to

include  those  trees  in  this  design  so

what  Im  gonna  do  first  is  Im  gonna

grab  it  the  Bezier  pen  which  is  over

here  you  can  just  press  B  on  the

keyboard  its  a  keyboard  shortcut  and

Im  gonna  manually  create  a  shape  going

around  the  tops  of  these  trees  here  and

Im  gonna  unify  it  with  the  bear  so  let

me  start  out  right  over  here  Im  gonna

click  to  create  a  shape  going  around  the

outside  around  here  let  me  zoom  in  a

little  bit  so  I  can  see  this  a  little

better  right  over  here  there  we  go  is

zoom  out  bring  it  straight  through  the

object  and  back  to  the  starting  point

like  that  now  what  Im  gonna  do  is  go  to

the  Select  tool  Im  gonna  hold  shift  Im

gonna  click  on  the  bear  graphic  with

them  both  selected  Ill  go  to  path  Union

and  now  I  will  hold  shift  and  click  on

the  trees  so  that  I  have  both  of  those

objects  selected  and  I  will  go  to  path

intersection  you  may  have  to  give  this  a

second  to  process  because  its  a  pretty

uh  its  a  large  photo  here  it  looks  like

it  didnt  work  for  this  one

let  me  des  elect  it  there  might  be  this

actually  might  be  a  group  of  images  so

let  me  try  ungrouping  this  you  see  if

that  helps  oh  there  we  go

it  was  grouped  thats  why  let  me  bring

the  opacity  down  let  me  click  off  of  the

graphic  to  deselect  everything  and  start

off  with  this  again

click  on  this  hold  shift  click  on  this

go  to  path  intersection  give  it  a  second

and  do  its  thing  and  there  we  go  as  you

can  see  we  have  a  combination  of  those

two  objects  there  then  let  me  bring  the

opacity  of  this  all  the  way  up

let  me  make  this  black  or  dark  gray  and

and  from  here  on  out  you  can  just  go

ahead  and  add  your  test  your  text  and

whatever  else  youd  like  to  add  and  that

should  pretty  much  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go  about

creating  those  double  exposure  style

logos  using  Inkscape  if  you  have  any

questions  let  me  know  and  as  always

thanks  for  watching
