in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over

everything  you  need  to  know  about

drawing  lines  in  inkscape  so  getting  us

started  lets  first  go  over  how  you  can

draw  simple  straight  lines  to  do  that

were  going  to  use  the  pencil  tool  which

could  be  located  over  here  in  your

toolbar  or  you  can  access  it  by  pressing

the  letter  P  on  your

keyboard  when  you  have  the  pencil  tool

enabled  youll  notice  up  here  in  the

tool  settings  we  have  these  three

different  modes  that  we  can  work  with

these  are  the  different  types  of  lines

that  you  can  draw  and  in  this  lesson

well  be  going  over  all  three  but  lets

first  focus  on  this  setting  right  here

which  allows  us  to  draw  simple  straight

lines  so  to  draw  your  straight  line  all

you  have  to  do  is  Click  once  to  add  a

point  and  then  move  your  cursor  wherever

you  would  like  the  line  to  be  and  then

click  again  to  add  another  point  and  now

we  have  a  simple  two-point  line  as  you

can  see  there  if  you  want  to  continue

drawing  this  line  all  you  have  to  do  is

connect  back  to  one  of  these  nodes  and

click  move  your  cursor  wherever  you

would  like  the  next  line  to  be  placed

and  click  again  and  now  we  have  a  single

three-point  line  that  follows  a  Bend

here  so  lets  say  you  want  to  draw

straight  lines  that  follow  a  perfect

vertical  or  horizontal  path  all  you  have

to  do  is  click  to  add  your  point  and

then  while  placing  your  line  hold  the

control  key  on  your  keyboard  and  if  you

bring  your  cursor  down  and  up  you  get  a

perfectly  vertical  line  or  if  you  bring

it  left  and  right  you  get  a  perfectly

horizontal  line  and  you  can  rotate  it

around  like  this  to  place  your  line  in

15Â°  increments  so  Im  going  to  create  a

vertical  line  right  here  click  to  add

the  point  and  Im  going  to  continue

drawing  straight  lines  down  here  Im

going  to  hold  Im  going  to  hold  control

and  draw  a  horizontal  line  now  and  then

I  will  draw  one  more  line  up  here  back

to  the  starting  point  and  we  end  up  with

something  like  that  right  there  so  let

me  get  rid  of  that  and  show  you  what

else  this  Bode  can  do  so  going  back  to

the  pencil  tool  another  thing  you  can  do

with  this  tool  is  draw  freehand  lines  so

if  I  click  and  drag  like  that  youll

notice  we  get  a  scribbled  line  that

follows  my  hand  movement  so  this  would

be  useful  if  youre  creating  something

like  a  signature  or  maybe  if  youre

using  a  stylus  or  a  pen  and  youre  want

and  you  want  to  draw  calligraphy  or

something  like  that  that  would  be  a  good

mode  to  use  for  that  the  problem  with

using  this  pen  mode  though  is  that  its

hard  to  get  really  smooth  lines  so  lets

say  I  wanted  to  draw  a  curse  of  letter  L

like  that  this  does  not  look  very  fluid

because  it  follows  my  hand  movement  and

my  hand  isnt  perfectly  stable  so  this

is  where  these  other  pen  modes  come  in

handy  Im  going  to  click  on  the  Spyro

option  now  this  middle  option  right  here

that  says  create  spiral  path  this  makes

it  so  that  the  freehand  lines  you  draw

follow  a  much  more  fluid  Contour  so  if  I

were  to  draw  that  same  letter  L  over

here  I  get  a  different  output  over  here

it  looks  much  more  smooth  in  fluid  now

to  show  you  what  I  mean  even  more  let  me

change  the  size  of  this  so  we  can  see

this  line  better  and  Ill  do  the  same

thing  to  this  line  over  here  Ill  make

this  bigger  as  well  Im  going  to  change

the  stroke  size  to

seven  now  Im  going  to  select  this  line

right  here  and  Im  going  to  grab  the

nodes  tool  and  if  you  know  notice  the

blue  path  on  there  represents  the  line

that  I  drew  but  the  black  line

represents  smooth  path  that  was  created

so  if  I  move  these  nodes  around  I  can

change  the  Contour  of  the  line  but  it

stays  smooth  the  whole  time  it  never

its  never  not  smooth  it  remains  pretty

fluid  as  you  can  see  there  so  that  isnt

exactly  the  case  over  here  if  I  click  on

these  handles  over  here  you  dont  really

get  that  smoothness  maintained  you  have

more  control  from  these  handles  this  is

better  for  creating  accurate  lines  but

this  is  better  over  here  for  creating

really  smooth

lines  so  lets  go  over  that  final  option

now  Im  going  to  go  back  to  the  let  me

deselect  everything  and  go  back  to  the

pencil  tool  and  we  have  this  final

option  over  here  which  is  creating  Beast

blind  paths  now  this  is  more  useful  when

it  comes  to  using  the  bezier  pen  which

well  go  over  in  just  a  minute  but  this

does  work  with  the  pencil  as  well  so  let

me  show  you  how  this  works  this  also

allows  you  to  draw  smooth  lines  but  it

gives  you  more  control  over  the  nodes

afterwards  so  if  I  change  the  size  of

this  let  me  make  this  seven  again  I  can

come  over  here  to  the  nodes  tool  and  if

you  notice  we  have  this  path  that  we  can

edit  but  the  lines  are  drawn  using

straight  lines  for  the  path  and  then  the

actual  stroke  itself  follows  a  curved

line  so  this  the  trade-off  youre  making

here  this  is  not  as  fluid  as  this  option

over  here  but  this  option  over  here

gives  you  more  control  over  where

exactly  you  can  place  the  Contours  of

the  line  This  option  over  here  gives  you

smoother  lines  but  its  kind  of  hard  to

really  control  where  the  lines  get

placed  because  its  always  making  sure

that  the  lines  were  made  smooth  now

lets  go  over  how  you  can  draw  lines

using  the  be  pen  which  is  located  over

here  in  your  toolbar  or  you  can  access

it  by  pressing  the  letter  B  on  your

keyboard  and  when  you  have  this  tool

enabled  up  here  in  the  tool  settings  you

notice  we  have  the  three  same  settings

that  we  had  previously  in  the  pencil

tool  in  addition  to  these  other  two  so

lets  go  over  what  all  of  this  does  Now

to  create  straight  lines  with  the  bezi

pen  all  you  have  to  do  is  click  to  add  a

point  just  like  the  PC  tool  but  the

difference  is  that  as  you  add  points  the

line  does  not  end  the  line  goes  on  as

long  as  youd  like  it  to  go  on  so  this

is  ideal  for  drawing  one  long  continuous

line  as  you  can  see  there  and  this  line

does  not  end  until  you  either  connect

back  to  the  starting  point  or  you  press

enter  on  the  keyboard  to  end  the  path

like  that  and  another  thing  that  you  can

do  with  this  mode  is  you  can  also  draw

curved  lines  in  addition  to  the  straight

lines  so  if  I  were  to  draw  a  straight

line  like  this  and  make  it  vertical  and

click  to  add  my  point  I  can  come  up  here

and  I  can  click  and  drag  to  add  my  point

and  as  Im  clicking  and  dragging  it

curves  the  line  as  you  can  see  there  and

then  you  could  bring  the  other  side  down

like  this  over  here  bring  this  line

straight  down  and  connect  it  back  to  the

starting  point  and  now  we  end  up  with

this  Pac-Man  sort  of  shape  right  here

now  the  problem  with  drawing  curved

lines  in  this  method  is  that  theres  a

pretty  steep  learning  curve  with  this

sort  of  method  its  really  hard  to

create  accurate  lines  that  follow  the

the  Contour  that  you  want  so  this  is

where  these  other  modes  come  in  handy  so

let  me  get  rid  of  all  of  this

here  and  Im  going  to  choose  the  spiral

path  now  now  if  I  click  to  add  my  points

its  creating  an  automatic  spiral  path

as  you  can  see  there  and  if  I  draw  My

Curse  of  letter  L  that  I  tried  with  the

pencil  tool  earlier  I  end  up  with  a  much

better  result  here  because  this  allows

me  to  create  more  accurate  placements  of

where  the  line  is  clicking  and  dragging

is  always  less  accurate  than  clicking  to

add  individual  points  and  you  can  see

here  we  end  up  with  a  much  better  result

so  let  me  make  this

bigger  Im  able  to  get  the  proportions

just  how  I  like

it  and  if  I  grab  my  nodes  tool  youll

notice  we  have  these  editable  nodes  here

the  path  remains  smooth  no  matter  what  I

do  to

it  and  then  finally  over  here  we  have

let  me  go  back  to  the  pen  tool  over  here

up  top  we  have  the  be  lines  this  works

the  same  way  were  clicking  to  add

points  and  its  creating  a  curved  line

although  were  drawing  a  straight  path

were  drawing  straight  lines  indicated

by  the  Blue  Line  there  and  then  the  path

being

drawn  is  curved  so  I  can  press  enter

like  that  and  the  downside  with  this  is

that  the  path  isnt  as  smooth  but  the  N

the  nodes  are  easier  to  control  same

with  the  pencil  tool  it  just  gives  you

more  control  over  these  nodes  here  like

that  let  me  make  this  bigger  so  you  can

see  it

better  and  there  you  go  now  another

thing  that  you  should  keep  in  mind  when

using  this  mode  this  is  actually  one  of

the  best  modes  to  use  with  the  pen  tool

I  use  this  more  than  anything  because

not  only  can  you  draw  curved  lines

easily  you  can  also  create  straight

lines  as  well  if  you  hold  the  shift  key

so  Im  going  to  hold  shift  and  click  to

add  a  point  and  now  we  have  a  corner

node  there  and  if  I  hold  shift  again  and

control  I  can  draw  a  straight  line  like

that  and  now  we  have  a  combination  of

straight  lines  and  curved  lines  as  you

can  see  there  and  this  is  actually  the

tool  that  I  use  whenever  Im  tracing  a

subject  to  create  a  silhouette  or

something  like  that  Ill  put  a  uh  a

little  video  up  on  the  screen  here  so

you  can  see  what  I  mean  this  allows  you

to  create  nice  smooth  fluid  lines  that

follow  what  youre  tracing  accurately

while  also  allowing  you  to  create

straight  lines  to  go  with  it  so  let  me

get  rid  of  all  this  and  lets  go  over

these  final  two  modes  right  here  this

one  right  here  is  for  creating  only

straight  lines  so  if  I  select  this  pen

mode  right  here  its  only  going  to  draw

straight  lines  now  you  may  be  wondering

what  the  point  of  this  mode  is  because

the  original  pen  mode  lets  you  draw

straight  lines  as  well  well  the

difference  is  that  with  this  tool  you

cant  accidentally  draw  curved  lines  so

if  I  click  and  drag  its  not  going  to

draw  curved  line  its  always  going  to  be

a  straight  line  as  you  can  see  there  now

if  I  go  back  to  my  original  pen  mode  and

I  click  like  that  if  you  click  ever  so

slightly  you  end  up  with  a  very  slight

Bend  in  that  line  there  even  if  you

cant  see  it  its  there  and  you  could

see  by  the  handles  if  theres  a  handle

showing  there  youll  notice  its  a

curved  line  so  this  is  actually  a

problem  when  youre  trying  to  draw

straight  lines  with  this  pen  mode

sometimes  youll  accidentally  create  a

curved  line  without  realizing  it  when

you  really  need  a  straight  line  so  this

is  when  this  mode  up  here  comes  in  handy

and  then  finally  we  have  this  setting  up

here  which  is  for  drawing  parallel  lines

so  if  I  if  I  choose  this  option  and

start  drawing  my  lines  youll  notice

every  line  that  I  draw  goes  parallel  to

the  original  line  that  I  drew  so  this

could  be  really  useful  if  youre  doing

something  like  drawing  a  floor  plan  or

tracing  over  something  that  where  you

need  to  keep  the  angles  preserved  just

like  that  and  you  can  connect  it  back  to

the  starting  point  as  you  can  see  there

if  I  start  off  drawing  a  perfectly

horizontal  line  its  going  to  make  it  so

that  every  line  that  I  draw  is  vertical

and  horizontal  like  that  so  this  could

actually  be  really  useful  if  youre

doing  something  like  tracing  over  a

Skyline  and  you  want  to  create  like

buildings  like  that  it  ensures  that  you

never  draw  any  kind  of  curved  path  at

all  so  those  are  all  of  the  ways  in

which  you  can  go  about  drawing  lines  in

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

then  consider  checking  out  my  inkscape

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

and  best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  $17  one

time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill  have

some  information  about  that  down  below

if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as  always
