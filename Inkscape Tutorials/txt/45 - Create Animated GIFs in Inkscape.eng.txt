this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  create  simple  animated  gifs

using  inkscape

now  unfortunately  inkscape  doesnt  allow

you  to  export  animated  gifs  so  what

were  going  to  do  is  were  going  to

create  the  frames  individually  and  then

open  them  as  layers  in  and  then

from  there  we  can  export  as  an  animated

gif  and  if  you  dont  know  what  is

its  a  free  and  open  source  image  editor

ill  have  a  link  to  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

download  and  install  that  real  quick  and

then  youll  be  good  to  get  started

so  for  my  example  here  as  you  can  see  i

have  this  little  animated  character  that

i  create  we  have  some

basic  facial  movements  going  on  here  and

then  we  have  a  sleeping  cat  on  the  desk

with  his  tail  occasionally  moving  and

the  way  that  i  made  this  was  i  created

these  frames  individually  here  in

inkscape

and  what  i  did  was  i  used  the  batch

export  feature  to  export  all  of  these

individual  images  and  then  open  them

with  and  then  from  there  i  was  able

to  quickly  export  it  so  im  going  to

show  you  how  to  do  something  similar

maybe  not  with  this  particular  design

im  going  to  show  you  how  to  create  like

a  simple  loading  spinner  design  so  lets

open  up  a  new  document  here  and  get

started  now  i  should  mention  that  you

should  be  using  inkscape  version  1.2  or

later  in  order  to  follow  along  with  this

tutorial  because  were  going  to  need  the

batch  export  feature  which  is  new  to

this  version  if  you  dont  know  which

version  youre  using  just  go  to  help  and

about  inkscape

and  it  should  tell  you  right  there  as

you  can  see  im  using  version  1.2  or

version  1.2.1  to  be  specific  so  as  long

as  youre  using  this  version  or  later

youll  be  good  to  go

so  im  going  to  press  1  on  the  keyboard

to  zoom  in  to  100

and  im  going  to  press  down  the  mouse

wheel  and  move  the  mouse  to  get  the  uh

canvas  off  of  the  page  here  were

actually  not  going  to  use  this  canvas  at

all  were  going  to  create  rectangles  and

use  those  for  our  frames  so  im  going  to

grab  the

rectangle  tool  the  squares  and

rectangles  tool  and  im  going  to  create

a

vertical  rectangle  like  that

maybe  a  little  smaller  and  im  going  to

use  this  handle  right  here  to  give  this

a  rounded  edge  we  want  this  to  be  all

the  way  around  it  like  that

and  im  going  to  make  this  a  lighter

shade  of  gray  maybe  something  like  that

now  ill  grab  the  selection  tool

im  going  to  duplicate  this  by  right

clicking  it  and  going  to  duplicate  and

then  im  going  to  move  this  down  but  im

also  going  to  hold  ctrl  on  my  keyboard

while  i  move  it  like  that  so  it  locks  it

onto  the  vertical  axis  and  now  we  have

these  two  rectangles  im  going  to  click

and  drag  over  both  of  those  im  going  to

group  them  together  by  going  to  object

and  selecting  group

and  now  if  i  click  on  this  object  as  you

can  see  here  we  have  these  scaling

handles  represented  by  these  arrows  if  i

click  on  this  again  youll  notice  it

toggles  between  the  scaling  handles  and

the  rotation  handles  with  this  rotation

handle  selected  im  just  going  to  click

and  drag  it  like  this  and  then  im  going

to  hold  the  ctrl  key  and  if  you  notice

as  i  hold  the  ctrl  key  its  locking  it

onto  15  degree  increments  so  im  going

to  start  right  here  and  while  holding

control  and  while  holding  the  click  im

going  to  press  the  space  bar  to  make  a

copy  and  im  going  to  move  this  over  to

the  right  one  two  three

press  the  space  bar  again  one  two  three

space  bar  again  one  two  three  and  for

this  last  one  you  can  just  let  go  and

there  you  go  now  we  have  the  individual

rectangles  for  our  spinner  so  let  me

click  and  drag  over  all  of  this  right

here  and  let  me  go  to  object

ungroup

click  off  of  the  graphic  to  deselect

everything  let  me  just  center  this  up

here  again  to  move  the  page  around  you

just  press  down  the  mouse  wheel  and  move

the  mouse  im  going  to  click  on  this  top

one  right  here  and  im  going  to  make

this  a  darker  shade  like  that

and  now  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

all  of  this  and  now  i  want  to  group  it

together  by  going  to  object

group

and  let  me  actually  just  scale  this  down

a little  bit  click  and  drag  this  to

scale  it  down  and  then  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  and  shift  to  make  this  a  little

smaller

so  i  want  that  to  be  a  little  smaller

like  that  and  now  im  going  to  create  a

rectangle  going  over  it  or  a  square

rather  im  going  to  click  and  drag  hold

ctrl  to  make  a  perfectly  symmetrical

square  like  that  we  dont  want  rounded

corners  on  this  one  so  im  going  to

click  on  this  little  corner  box  up  here

that  says  make  corner  sharp

and  i  will  make  this  one  white  this  is

going  to  represent  the  background  of  our

design  so  let  me  grab  the  select  tool

let  me  lower  this  to  the  bottom  this

button  right  here  that  says  lower

selection  to  the  bottom

and  now  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

both  of  these  objects  and  i  want  to  make

sure  that  that  its  centered  up

vertically  and  horizontally  so  im  going

to  open  up  the  alignment  menu  which  is

right  here  the  keyboard  shortcut  is  ctrl

shift  a  so  im  just  going  to  use  that

instead  ctrl  shift  a

where  it  says  relative  to  make  sure  you

have  last  selected  enabled  and  were

going  to  center  this  up  on  the  vertical

axis  and  the  horizontal  axis  like  that

and  i  actually  dont  like  the  contrast

here  id  like  this  to  be  a  little  darker

so  im  just  going  to  grab  the  edit  paths

by  nodes  tool  and  click  on  that  one

object  right  there  and  im  going  to

choose  a  darker  shade

there  we  go  that  looks  a little  better

okay  click  off  of  the  deselect  so  what  i

want  to  do  is  i  basically  want  to  create

copies  of  this  for  each  frame  of  this  i

want  each  of  these  rectangles  to  be

highlighted  in  this  color  in  separate

frames  so  let  me  select  this  right  here

let  me  press  ctrl  d  to  duplicate  it

hold  ctrl  move  it  over  to  the  right  like

this  and  now  we  have  our  second  frame

so  i  want  to  rotate  this  around  im

going  to  click  on  this  object

click  on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles  and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  im

going  to  rotate  this

three  steps  to  the  right  like  that  so

now  we  have  another  copy  of  this  object

where  this  rectangle  is  illuminated

instead  of  this  one

and  if  you  can  see  where  im  going  with

this  im  going  to  create  more  copies  for

every  single  one  of  these  rectangles  so

let  me  zoom  out  here  to  zoom  in  and  out

im  just  holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  and

down  the  mouse  wheel  let  me  create

another  copy  of  this

ctrl  d

hold  control  move  it  over  like  that

click  off  of  it  to  deselect

click  on  the  object

click  on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles

and  then  hold  ctrl

one  two  three  and  there  we  go  now  we

have  that  one  so  ill  show  you  this  one

more  time  im  going  to  click  and  drag

over  it

ctrl  d  to  duplicate

hold  ctrl  move  this  over  here

click  off  of  it  deselect

click  on  just  this  object  right  here

click  on  it  again  to  get  the  rotation

handles  hold  control

one  two  three  there  we  go  and  what  ill

do  is  ill  just  fast  forward  through

this  real  quick

okay  so  as  you  can  see  i  have  finished

making  my  frames  the  last  one  that  i  was

going  to  make  is  this  one  right  here

because  the  first  one  is  already

represented  by  this  one  right  here  so

now  we  have  all  of  our  individual  frames

let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  so  you  can

see  it  better

once  we  are  finished  making  our  frames

what  we  want  to  do  is  group  them  all

together  individually  so  im  going to

click  and  drag  over  this  one  and  im

going  to  group  it  instead  of  going  to

object  and  selecting  group  an  easier  way

to  do  this  would  be  to  just  press

control  g  on  the  keyboard  so  control  g

click  and  drag  over  this  one  ctrl  g

ctrl  g  and  you  get  the  id  im  just  going

through  and  grouping  these  one  by  one

and  we  want  to  make  sure  that  these  are

grouped  so  that  when  we  batch  export  it

they  will  all  be  their  own  individual

elements  each  frame

okay  so

now  im  going  to  close  out  of  the  align

distribute  menu  what  i  want  now  is  the

layers  menu  so  over  here  where  it  says

view  objects

click  that  button  right  there  keyboard

shortcut  control  shift  and  l

and  if  i  click  on  these  objects  youll

notice  that  they  highlight  as  they

select  them  so  im  going  to  click  on

this  one  right  here  and  as  you  can  see

whats  highlighted  is  this

this  label  right  here  i  want  to  change

the  name  of  this  from  whatever  this  is

to  the  number  one  because  this  is  the

first  frame  in  our  sequence  let  me

double  click  that  im  going  to  change  it

to  one

and  press  enter

ill  click  on  this  one  this  is  frame

number  two  and  this  one  is  whats

highlighted  so  ill  click  on  that  and

change  that  to  two

press  enter

ill  change  this  one  to  three

press  enter

four

five

six

seven

and  eight

and  if  youre  having  trouble  seeing

which  layer  you  have  selected  sometimes

if  youre  working  with  a  complicated

animation  youre  going  to  have  lots  of

different  layers  and  different  frames

going  on  here  you  might  have  to  scroll

up  and  down  through  this  list  here  if

you  have  a  lot  of  items  to  figure  out

which  which  it  is  that  you  have  selected

so  once  weve  finished  doing  that  weve

now  have  our  we  now  have  our  individual

layers  ready  to  go  im  going  to  click

and  drag  over  all  of  these  objects  right

here

and  now  what  i  want  to  do  is  open  up  the

export  menu  i  will  go  to  file  and  i  will

select  export

now  in  this  menu  we  want  to  choose  batch

export  and  we  want  to  make  sure  we  have

selection  we  have  these  three  different

options  we  have  layer  selection  and

pages  we  want  to  choose  selections  now

by  default  if  you  have  all  of  these

selected  you  should  see  its  all  ready

to  go  right  here  we  have  these  check

boxes  here  one  two  three  four  its  not

in  order  but  thats  okay  it  doesnt  have

to  be

and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im

going  to  choose  a  place  on  my  computer

to  export  these  two  im  just  going  to

put  these  on  my  desktop  click  this

little  folder  icon  down  right  here  and

im  just  going  to  put  this  on  my  desktop

and  im  going  to  name  this

im  just  going to  name  this  spinner

click  save

leave  these  defaults  as  they  are  and

click  ok  and  then  it  will  export  all  of

those  individually

and  they  should  all  be  there  now  on  your

desktop  so  now  its  time  to  open  up

so  that  we  can  turn  this  into  an

animated  gif  so  let  me  open  up

let  me  open  up

and  once  you  have  opened  what  you

want  to  do  is  go  to  file  and  select  open

as  layers

now  you  should  see  right  here  i  have  my

desktop  opened  heres  the  spinner

graphics  spinner  one  two  three  four  so

on  and  so  forth  you  want  to  select  all

of  these  so  im  gonna  select  it  hold

shift  and  click  on  all  of  these  so  that

we  have  them  all  selected

and  go  to  open

now  this  may  take  a  second  because  it

has  to  open  up  each  of  these  individual

images  one  by  one  as  you  see  it  doing

here  so  give  it  a  second  to  do  its  thing

and  it  should  open  them  in  order  as  long

as  you  numbered  them  like  i  demonstrated

in  the  export  portion  of  the  lesson  they

should  open  up  an  order  like  that  and

now  what  you  can  do  is  you  can  just

export  this  as  an  animated  gif  so  lets

go  to  file  and  go  to  export  as

and  im  going  to  title  this

im  just  going  to  name  this  spinner

and  over  here  where  it  says  select  file

type  im  going  to  choose

gif  image  and  click  export

now  this  parts  really  important  uh

youre  going  to  get  this  menu  that  pops

up  make  sure  where  it  says  as  animation

make  sure  you  have  this  enabled  by

default  when  you  open  up  this  will

be  deselected  if  you  dont  have  this

selected  its  just  going  to  export  it  as

a  static  image  make  sure  you  have  that

selected  right  there  and  this  right  here

delay  between  frames  were  unspecified  in

milliseconds  i  think  by  default  its  200

now  um  the  number  that  you  should  put

here  depends  on  your  graphic  but  for

this  spinner  graphic  im  just  going  to

use  100

if  you  if  you  use  this  number  and  you

find  out  its  too  fast  or  the  animation

is  too  slow  you  can  always  go  back  and

change  this  number  later  on  so  im  going

to  im  just  going to  leave  it  at  100

press  export

and  if  i  go  to  my  desktop  it  should

be  there

let  me  get  out  of  there

where  is  uh

spinner.gif  there  we  go

its  gonna  open  this  up  and  there  you  go

now  we  have  our  spinning  our  little

loading  spinner

animation  that  we  created  with  inkscape

and  with  so

i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  create

simple  animated  gifs  using  inkscape  if

you  found  this  lesson  useful  then

consider  checking  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos  where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools

and  features  in  inkscape  and  i  explain

what  they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they

work  kind  of  like  how  i  did  in  this

video  we  even  have  a  private  community

where  you  can  ask  questions  and  get  help

from  me  anytime  you  want  ill  have  some

information  about  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  as  always  thanks  for
