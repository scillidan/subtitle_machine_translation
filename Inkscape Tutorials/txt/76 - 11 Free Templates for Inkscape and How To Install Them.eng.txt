one  of  my  favorite  features  in  Inkscape

is  having  the  ability  to  create  a

document  and  save  it  as  a  template  that

you  can  launch  directly  from  within

Inkscape  anytime  you  want  this  is  useful

because  it  means  you  wont  have  to  waste

time  formatting  your  document  every  time

you  go  to  create  certain  types  of

designs  that  you  may  regularly  work  with

like  YouTube  thumbnails  channel  art

business  cards  invoices  and  so  on  if  you

go  to  file  new  from  template  youll  see

a  list  of  templates  that  are  already

formatted  for  whatever  it  is  youd  like

to  create  and  if  youre  using  Inkscape

version  1.0  or  later  you  can  add  your

templates  to  this  library  by  going  to

file  save  template  and  from  there  you

can  choose  a  name  along  with  some  other

metadata  and  whatever  it  is  youre

currently  working  on  an  Inkscape  will  be

saved  to  that  library  as  a  template  that

you  could  launch  anytime  youd  like  all

you  have  to  do  is  go  to  file  new  from

template  and  there  it  will  be  because  of

this  Ive  been  able  to  generate  a  list

of  eleven  templates  for  common  design

items  like  print-ready  business  cards

and  trifold  brochures  with  bleed  lines

and  dpi  already  accounted  for  and  in

this  video  Ill  be  sharing  them  with  you

and  just  to  be  clear  these  are  not

designs  these  are  just  blank  templates

that  you  can  load  into  your  template

library  and  use  to  create  your  own

designs  in  the  description  of  the  video

Ill  have  a  link  to  where  you  can

download  a  zip  folder  with  these

templates  in  them  once  you  open  the

folder  youll  see  a  list  of  templates

including  brochures  business  cards

contact  icons  for  business  cards

Facebook  banners  Google  Ads  and  so  on

like  I  mentioned  earlier  all  you  have  to

do  is  open  one  of  these  files  with

Inkscape  then  go  to  file  save  template

and  if  youre  using  an  earlier  version

of  Inkscape  that  doesnt  yet  have  the

same  template  feature  you  can  simply

navigate  to  see  Program  Files

Inkscape  share  templates  and  copy  and

paste  all  of  the  files  into  that  folder

and  the  next  time  you  launch  Inkscape

you  will  be  able  to  create  a  new

document  based  on  one  of  those  templates

this  method  also  works  for  Inkscape

version  1.0  if  you  dont  feel  like

opening  each  document  one  by  one  and

saving  it  although  the  pathway  is

slightly  different  for  this  one  navigate

to  see  Program  Files  share  Inkscape

place  Ill  have  this  information  posted

in  the  description  as  well  one  thing  Id

like  to  point  out  is  that  some  of  these

templates  may  be  a  little  confusing  when

you  first  open  them  take  the  brochure

template  for  example  it  has  separate

layers  with  boundaries  that  represent

the  bleed  cutoff  line  another  example

would  be  the  business  card  templates  as

you  may  already  know  business  card  sizes

differ  by  countries  so  I  created  a

master  file  with  every  size  included  if

youre  unsure  of  how  this  works  then  I

would  recommend  checking  out  the  PDF

document  in  the  zip  folder  it  has  links

to  some  articles  that  Ive  written  in

the  past  where  I  explained  how  some  of

these  templates  work  in  more  detail

other  templates  like  the  switch  banner

for  example  are  more  self-explanatory

because  its  just  a  document  set  to  a

specific  width  and  height  the  templates

are  free  to  download  and  use  however

youd  like  without  any  need  for

attribution  Im  releasing  them  into  the

public  domain  so  use  them  however  you

want  you  can  even  redistribute  them  if

youd  like

finally  if  you  want  to  learn  more  about

how  Inkscape  perks  be  sure  to  check  out

my  Inkscape  course  its  a  collection  of

over  60  videos  where  I  go  over  every

single  tool  and  feature  in  Inkscape  and

I  explain  what  it  is  and  demonstrate  how

it  works  Ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  if  you  want  to  check  that
