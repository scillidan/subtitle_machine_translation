this  is  Nick  with  logos  by  Nick  comm  and

in  this  tutorial  Ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  use  a  drawing  tablet  with

Inkscape  and  if  youd  like  to  learn  more

about  how  Inkscape  works  be  sure  to

check  out  my  Inkscape  masterclass  its  a

collection  of  over  50  videos  where  I  go

over  every  single  tool  and  feature  in

Inkscape  and  I  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works  Ill  have  a

link  in  the  description  of  the  video  if

you  want  to  check  that  out  so  to  get  us

started  here  as  you  can  see  I  have

Inkscape  opened  up  on  my  screen  and  I

have  my  drawing  tablet  here  on  my  desk

and  the  way  that  a  drawing  tablet  works

is  that  it  basically  allows  you  to

create  freehand  digital  art  the  same  way

you  would  with  the  pencil  and  paper  and

the  tablet  Im  using  here  is  a  Wacom

Intuos  Ill  have  a  link  in  the

description  to  a  short  review  I  wrote

about  it  last  year  in  case  youre

interested  the  way  that  this  works  is

that  you  plug  it  in  through  a  USB  Drive

and  if  youre  using  Windows  10  it  should

be  automatically  recognized  and

functional  without  having  to  install

anything  that  was  the  case  for  me  anyway

if  that  doesnt  work  for  you  then  youll

probably  have  to  install  some  drivers

depending  on  your  operating  system  Ill

have  a  link  in  the  description  for  those

as  well  if  you  need  to  download  them  and

once  you  have  your  tablet  installed  it

basically  functions  the  same  way  a  mouse

would  let  me  show  you  what  I  mean  here

Im  gonna  take  the  tip  of  the  pen  and

hover  it  above  the  surface  of  the  tablet

right  here  and  if  you  notice  as  I  move

it  around  it  moves  the  cursor  on  this

screen  as  well  and  if  you  notice  Im  not

actually  touching  the  surface  of  a

tablet  once  I  do  touch  the  surface  of

the  tablet  it  registers  the  same  way  it

would  is  if  you  were  to  click  and  drag

with  your  mouse  and  by  the  way  this

works  system-wide  you  dont  just  have  to

install  this  with  Inkscape  once  you  have

this  installed  you  can  use  this  with  any

of  your  other  applications  as  well  so

this  this  works  its  kind  of  like

installing  fonts  where  once  its

installed  it  works  it  works  system-wide

and  the  way  that  this  works  here  is  that

the  surface  area  of  the  tablet  is

represented  by  the  perimeter  of  your

screen  so  if  you  bring  your  if  you  bring

the  pen  to  the  top  left  portion  of  the

tablet  the  cursor  is  located  in  the  top

left  portion  of  the  screen  and  then  down

here  to  the  bottom  right  so  on  and  so

forth  you  get  the  idea  now  once  you  have

your  tablet  installed  I  would  recommend

that  you  go  through  some  of  the  settings

and  get  them  set  up  first  so  what  youre

wrong  what  youre  gonna  want  to  do  is

come  over  here  to  where  it  says  search

and  type  in  Wacom  youre  looking  for  a

Wacom  tablet  property

you  click  on  that  and  over  here  you  can

just  take  these  buttons  on  the  tablet

and  program  and  to  do  whatever  you  want

these  are  these  buttons  over  here  I

dont  use  them  personally  but  if  you

want  to  you  can  program  that  to  whatever

you  want  what  Im  paying  attention  to

mostly  is  the  pen  and  mapping  so  first

of  all  with  the  pen  you  can  adjust  the

sensitivity  to  the  pen  or  the  distance

between  the  pen  and  a  tablet  with  these

settings  over  here  over  here  youll

notice  you  can  program  the  buttons  on

the  pen  if  you  look  at  the  pen  closely  I

dont  know  if  you  can  tell  in  the  video

but  theres  two  buttons  on  this  pen  here

theres  one  down  here  and  one  up  here

and  you  can  program  these  buttons  to  do

whatever  you  want  if  you  click  this  drop

down  over  here  you  can  see  all  the

different  things  you  could  program  it  to

do  I  programmed  it  to  do  a  specific

keystroke  which  is  control  Z  which  is

the  undo  function  and  I  find  that  useful

because  sometimes  Ill  be  drawing

brushstrokes  or  something  and  I  dont

like  how  it  came  out

instead  of  having  to  come  over  to  the

keyboard  and  press  control  Z  I  can  just

press  that  button  on  the  pen  and  undo

that  brushstroke  so  thats  really  useful

and  the  other  thing  over  here  disabled

this  other  button  I  havent  found  a  use

for  it  yet  so  like  I  just  left  it

disabled  and  then  finally  over  here

where  it  says  mapping  this  is

particularly  important  if  youre  using

multiple  monitors  like  I  am  as  you  can

see  here  I  have  a  triple  monitor  setup

but  I  have  it  set  up  so  that  this  tablet

only  works  on  this  Center  monitor  right

here  which  is  the  monitor  Im  using  for

this  video

by  default  when  I  first  installed  when  I

first  installed  this  tablet  when  I  first

plugged  it  in  it  had  all  three  monitors

indicated  here  so  that  when  I  used  the

surface  area  of  the  tablet  this  whole

width  of  the  tablet  represented  the

entire  width  of  all  three  of  these

monitors  but  the  height  stayed  the  same

this  created  a  distortion  of  an  aspect

ratio  of  three  to  one  and  it  was  really

difficult  to  draw  I  couldnt  figure  out

why  things  that  I  was  drawing  with  the

tablet  didnt  look  right  on  the  screen

like  for  example  if  you  were  to  draw  a

perfectly  round  circle  on  the  tablet  it

would  be  represented  by  a  really

elongated  ellipse  on  the  screen  here  and

I  couldnt  figure  out  why  that  was  and

then  eventually  I  realized  it  was

because  I  had  I  had  the  surface  area  of

the  tablet  mapped  to  all  three  monitors

so  if  youre  using  multiple  monitors

make  sure  to  come  over  here  to  the  to

the  mapping  tab  and  just  set  it  up  so

youre  just  using  one  monitor  here  then

we  can  close  out  of  that  and  now  were

good  to  get  started  here  in  Inkscape

theres  a  few  different  things  you  can

do  with  the  drawing  tablet  here  in

Inkscape  one  thing  you  can  do  is  you  can

come  over  here  to  the  free  hand  lines

tool  the  tutorial  I  did  the  other  day

about  using  custom  brushes  you  can  use

that  another  thing  you  could  do  is  you

can  create  some  calligraphy  with  the

calligraphy  pen  over  here  for  this  I

like  to  use  the  dip  pen  the  width  I  have

set  to  37  the  thinning  set  to  10  and

then  the  rest  the  defaults  are  just  the

default  as  they  are  and  then  you  just

come  over  to  your  canvas  over  here  to

your  drawing  tablet  and  then  just  click

and  drag  like  that  or  actually  press

down  the  pen  and  move  it  around  to

create  some  calligraphy  like  that  and  as

you  can  see  it  draws  it  on  the  screen  so

thats  one  thing  you  can  do  with  the

drawing  tablet  in  Inkscape  another  thing

this  would  be  useful  for  is  if  youre

creating  those  line  art  style  logos  that

I  did  in  the  previous  tutorial  a  couple

years  ago  it  would  be  really  useful  for

that  sort  of  thing  is  where  you  could

just  draw  them  freehand  without  having

to  do  all  of  that  with  the  with  the

mouse  and  clicking  and  dragging  so  I

think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  thats  how  you  can  go  about

getting  yourself  set  up  with  a  drawing

tablet  and  Inkscape  if  you  have  any

questions  leave  a  comment  below  and  as

always  thanks  for  watching
