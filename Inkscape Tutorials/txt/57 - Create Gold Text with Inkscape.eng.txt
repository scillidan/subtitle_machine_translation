this  is  nick  with  logos  by  nick.com  and

in  this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating

how  you  can  create  this

shiny  gold  text  using  inkscape  but

before  we  get  started  if  youd  like  to

learn  everything  that  there  is  to  know

about  inkscape

be  sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class  its  a  collection  of  over  60

videos

where  i  go  over  every  tool  and  feature

in  inkscape  and  i  explain  what  it  is  and

demonstrate  how  it  works

ill  have  a  link  in  the  description  of

the  video  if  you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  us  started  here  in  inkscape

lets  first  set  up  the  document  so  that

we  all  have  a  similar  workflow

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  view  make

sure  you  have  custom  selected

and  then  come  up  to  zoom  and  zoom  in  at

one  to  one

like  that  and  then  we  want  to  make  sure

that  we  have  snapping  disabled  for  this

tutorial  so  up  here  at  the  very  far  top

left  where  it  says  enable  snapping

go  ahead  and  disable  that  and  that  will

be  good  to  get  started  so

the  first  step  is  to  create  some  text  so

im  going  to  grab  the  text  tool  right

here

im  going  to  click  on  the  canvas  to  get

the  blinking  cursor  and  for  this

tutorial  i  will  be  using  the  word

gold  text  and  im  going  to  triple  click

that  to  highlight  all  of  it

and  change  the  font  so  lets  open  up  the

text  editor  up  here  and  the  font  im

going  to  be  using  for  this  tutorial  is

called

irs  or  ayers  however  its  pronounced  i

would  recommend  using  this  font  if  youd

like  to  make  this

effect  work  because  for  whatever  reason

it  just  works  really  well  with  this  font

ive  tried  it  with  other  fonts  that

didnt  quite

look  right  but  with  this  font  it  really

pops  so  ill  put  a  link  in  the

description  to  where  you  can  download

this  font  for  free

if  you  want  to  give  that  a  try  so  go

ahead  and  click  apply  now

and  now  im  going  to  make  this  bigger  so

let  me  grab  the  select  tool

and  im  going  to  grab  this  arrow  and

just  scale  this  up  im  going  to  hold

ctrl  so  it  locks  the  proportions  like

that

and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  color

this  in  in  order  to  make  this  look  like

gold  im  going  to  have  to  apply  a

gradient

and  the  colors  that  i  use  in  the

gradient  are  very  important  in  fact

theyre  so  important  that  ive  written

down  the  color  codes  for  each  individual

shade  of  the  gradient

and  i  will  post  them  in  the  description

box  of  the  video  so  that  you  can  follow

along  with  what  im  doing  exactly  you

can  go  ahead  and

copy  and  paste  them  yourself  so  lets

apply  a  gradient  here  im  going  to  grab

the  uh

the  edit  objects  colors  gradients  and

stroke  menu  right  here  the  fill  and

stroke  menu

you  can  click  that  button  or  press  ctrl

shift  and  f  to  open  that  up

and  im  going  to  come  over  here  under

the  fill  tab

im  going  to  look  for  where  it  says

linear  gradient  right  there  and  click  on

that

and  then  im  going  to  grab  the  gradient

tool  and  im  going  to  click  on  this

little  round  stop  right  here

and  im  going to  bring  the  opacity  of

that  up  so  that  right  now  its  a

gradient  going  from  black

to  black  so  i  will  take  this  node  right

here  and  put  this  at  the  bottom  of  the

gradient

or  the  bottom  of  the  text  and  i  will

take  this  node  and  put  this  at  the  top

of  the  text  and  i  will  hold  ctrl  so  that

its  going  up

vertically  just  like  that  okay  so  right

now  we  have  two  different  stops  in  this

gradient

this  gold  color  is  going  to  have  five

stops  in  it  so  i  have  to  add

three  stops  to  this  gradient  so  to  do

that  im  just  going  to  double  click  on

the  line  right  here  to  add  a  new  stop  in

there

ill  double  click  again  to  add  another

one  and  then  one  more

and  now  what  i  have  to  do  is  select  each

of  these  stops  and

paste  the  color  codes  into  them  so  ill

start  at  the  top  right  here

working  from  top  to  bottom  im  gonna  i

have  a  notepad  opened  on  my  other

monitor  with  these  color  codes  written

out  that  i  could  just  paste  in  there

like  i  said  i  will  have  these  in  the

description  box  of  the  video  so  you  can

do  the  same  you  can  just  go  ahead  and

copy  and  paste  them  right  in

so  im  going  to  select  each  stop  and

just  paste  them  into  the  rgba  box  here

like  that

as  you  see  me  doing  take  this  one  as

well

paste  that  in  there

this  one  here  paste  that  in  here

and  then  finally  one  more  to  go  im  just

ctrl  c  to  copy

ctrl  v  to  paste  just  like  that

and  now  i  want  to  adjust  the  positions

of  these  colors  on  the  gradient  i  want

to  take  this  top  one  and  move  this  a

little  closer  to  the  top  like  that

and  i  want  to  take  this  one  right  here

this  middle  one  which  is  like  the  dark

the  darker  shade  and  bring  that  towards

the  top  third  or  the  bottom  of  the  top

third  of  the  text  right  there  right

about  there  looks  pretty  good

and  then  take  this  one  right  here  and

bring  this  up  closer  towards  that  darker

one  like  that

and  that  right  there  is  the  look  were

going  for  this  is  starting  uh  starting

to  come  together  its  starting  to  look

like  gold  text

only  now  were  going  to  add  a  little  bit

of  depth  to  it  so  lets  grab  the  select

tool

and  lets  create  a  duplicate  copy  of

this  text  lets  right  click  this  and  go

to  duplicate

and  lets  give  this  a  outline  otherwise

known  as  a  stroke  im  going  to  im  just

going  to  use  the  color  red  for  now  im

going  to  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  color  red  to  give

that  an  outline  like  that

and  then  im  going  to  send  that  to  the

back  im  going  to  come  up  here  to  this

button  that  says

lower  selection  to  the  bottom  click  on

that  so  that  it  goes  behind  the  original

text

and  ill  come  over  here  to  the  stroke

style  tab  and  i  want  to  increase  the

size  of  this  stroke

maybe  not  that  much  let  me  change  this

to  pixels  lets  try  something  like

six  or  maybe  five

maybe  not  that  much  i  want  i  dont  want

this  to  be  too  thick  maybe  its  four  and

a  half  that  should  be  pretty  good

okay  that  looks  good  enough  right  there

somewhere  there  about  it  doesnt  have  to

be  exactly  the  same  size  as  mine  so  just

go  ahead  and  eyeball  it

and  now  i  want  to  give  that  red  outline

the  same  gradient

that  the  gold  text  has  only  in  reverse

so  lets  come  over  here  to  the  stroke

paint  tab

and  click  on  linear  gradient  and  were

going  to  choose  our  gradient  from  our

list  over  here

and  now  lets  grab  the  gradient  tool  so

we  can  adjust  the  position  of  that

gradient

so  right  here  on  the  vertical  axis  you

can  see  our  original  gradient

over  here  on  the  horizontal  axis  thats

the  current  gradient  for  the  stroke

so  what  i  want  to  do  is  do  the  same

thing  with  the  original  gradient  only  in

reverse  if  you  see  here

on  the  original  gradient  we  have  the

circle  node  on  top

and  the  square  node  on  the  bottom  i  want

to  do  the  opposite  for  this  one  i  want

to  put  the  circle  node  on  the  bottom

oops  didnt  mean  to  do  that  put  the

circle  node  on  the  bottom

and  put  the  square  note  on  the  top  and

again  again  just  hold  ctrl  to  lock  it

onto  the

vertical  axis  like  that  and  there  you  go

so  lets  grab  the  select  tool  now

click  off  of  that  to  deselect  everything

its  starting  to  come  together  now  what

im  going to  do  is  im  going  to  break

these  letters  apart  and  adjust  the

spacing  between  them  so

lets  click  and  drag  over  both  of  these

text  objects  and  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  then  ungroup  over

here  where  it  says  ungroup  selected

groups

and  now  its  individual  letters  like

that  so  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

this  letter  g

im  going  to  zoom  in  on  this  a little

bit  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  roll  up

the  mouse  wheel  a  couple  of  times  to

zoom  in

and  im  just  going  to  hold  ctrl  im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  this  letter

g  right  here  so  i  have  both  objects

selected

and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  just  move

this  over  like  that  im  just  manually

adjusting  the  spacing  between  these

letters  here  as  you  can  see

clicking  and  dragging  over  all  three

letters

moving  it  in  then  im  going  to  click  and

drag  over  the  whole  word  move  that  in

and  again  while  were  doing  this  were

holding  ctrl  on  the  keyboard  so  that  it

locks  it  onto  the  vertical  axis  like

that

okay  that  looks  pretty  good  move  this  in

and  then  finally  this  one  this  ones  a

little  too  close  to  the  t  so  im  going

to  move  that  back  just  a  tiny  bit

and  maybe  ill  put  some  more  space

between  the  two  words  like  that

that  right  there  looks  good  so  well

click  off  of  that  to  deselect  everything

now  what  i  want  to  do  is  unify

these  letters  together  these  these  uh

the  letters  on  top  anyway

so  im  going  to  click  on  the  letter  g

and  then  im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  all  of  the  other  letters

so  that  we  have  all  of  them  selected  and

unify  them  together  by  going  to  path

union  and  the  reason  why  i  do  that  is

because  now  i  want  to  create

sort  of  like  a  reflective  light  or  like

a  shine  coming  off  of  the  top  of  this

text  here  and  im  going  to  need  a

duplicate  copy  of  that  text  to  do  that

so

with  the  text  selected  right  click  it

and  go  to  duplicate

and  make  the  duplicate  copy  white  and

now  were  going  to  create  a  little  bit

of  an  offset

of  this  white  text  right  here  so  lets

come  over  here  to  the

path  effects  menu  well  go  to  path  and

click  on  path  effects

and  im  going  to  click  the  plus  icon

here  to  add  a  new  path  effect

and  the  path  effect  were  looking  for  is

offset  which  is  right  here

and  with  offset  enabled  im  going  to

zoom  in  a  little  bit  what  i  want  to  do

is  grab  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

which  is  right  here

and  what  you  should  be  looking  for  is

this  little  circle  node  right  here  if

you  notice  everything  else  is  a  square

node  were  looking  for  this  circle  node

right  here  let  me  zoom  in  on  that  a

little  bit

and  im  going  to  take  this  circle  node

and  just  click  and  drag  that  down  a

little  bit  just  to

give  that  a  little  bit  of  an  offset  and

what  you  notice  what  its  doing  here  is

its  shaving  off  a  little  space

off  of  around  the  edges  of  the  letters

like  that  which  is  exactly  what  were

looking  for

okay  so  im  happy  with  how  that  looks

im  going  to  finalize  it  by  going  to

path

path  object  to  path  grab  the  select  tool

im  going  to  press  1  on  the  keyboard  to

zoom  back  out  to  a  hundred  percent

and  lets  close  out  of  the  path  effects

menu  we  dont  need  that  anymore

now  what  im  gonna  do  is  im  going  to

create  an  ellipse  going  over  the  top

half  of  this  white  text  here  so  let  me

grab  these  circles  and  ellipses  tool

ill  click  and  drag  to  create  an  ellipse

going  over  the  top  of  it  like  that

and  i  want  to  get  rid  of  that  outline

lets  hold  shift  and  click  the  little

red  x  down  here  to  get  rid  of  that

outline

and  im  just  going  to  make  this  a

contrasting  color  for  now  maybe

something  like  green

bring  the  opacity  down  so  i  can  see

where  it  lines  up  with  the  rest  of  the

text

and  let  me  grab  the  select  tool  right

here  now  if  you  notice  the  bottom  edge

of  this  green  ellipse

im  paying  attention  to  where  it  lines

up  with  the  text  i  want  it  above  this

part  of  the  g

but  below  this  part  of  the  g  right  here

right  about  here  we  want  this  to  be  in

about  the  top  third  of  the  text  as  you

see  here  i  like  this  position

so  im  going  to  leave  that  as  it  is  im

going  to  hold  shift  click  the  white  text

so  that  we  have  the  green  ellipse  and

the  white  text  selected  at  the  same  time

and  go  to  path  intersection

and  what  we  have  to  do  now  is  give  this

thing  a  gradient  so  lets  come  over  here

to  the  fill

tab  and  click  on  the  linear  gradient

button

and  then  grab  the  gradient  tool  over

here  and  take  this

little  uh  white  stop  over  here  and  put

this  towards  the  bottom  of  that  white

object

and  then  take  this  circle  stop  and  put

this  towards  the  top  im  going  to  hold

ctrl

to  lock  it  onto  the  vertical  axis  like

that  now  if  you  notice  im  not  putting

this

exactly  at  the  bottom  of  the  white  text

there  im  putting  it  slightly  below  so

its  not  so

its  not  so  harsh  and  this  one  right

here  this  is  not  going  all  the  way  up  to

the  top  im  putting  this  down  to  about

here  like  that

and  at  this  point  you  may  have  to  adjust

the  position  of  the  original  gradient  so

let  me  click  on  the  gold  text

and  im  going  to  take  this  if  you  notice

im  going  to  take  this  stop  right  here

and  bring  that  down  a  little  bit

and  bring  this  down  a little  bit  as  well

maybe  bring  this  down  to  here

whoops  messed  up  there  if  you  mess  up

and  do  something  like  this  just  hit  ctrl

z  on  the  keyboard  to  undo  what  you  just

did

okay  thats  looking  thats  looking

pretty  good  right  there  okay  so  let  me

grab  the  select  tool

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

and  the  final  step  would  be  to  add  a

little  bit  of  a  drop  shadow  to  this  to

make  it  pop  a  little  more  so  to  do  that

im  going  to  click  on  the  gold  text  im

going  to  duplicate  it  by  pressing  ctrl  d

on  the  keyboard  and  im  going  to  make

that  black  and  im  going  to  bring  this

down

slightly  down  im  going to  bring  it  down

slightly

and  to  the  right  slightly  and  im  gonna

lower  that  to  the  bottom  with  this

button  over  here  that  says  lower

selection  to  the  bottom

maybe  even  use  the  arrow  keys  to  adjust

it  a little  bit  that  right  there  is

pretty  good

and  i  will  give  this  a  little  bit  of  a

blur

just  like  that  and  then  finally  bring

the  opacity  down  a  little  bit

maybe  reduce  the  blur  reduce  the  opacity

and  you  get  the  idea  you  just  play  with

a  little  bit  and  as  you  can  see  weve

finished  creating  our  gold  text  now  one

final  thing  i  would  i  would  recommend

using  this  for  a  dark  background  for

whatever  reason  this

gold  text  effect  really  pops  better  on

dark  backgrounds  so

let  me  create  a  rectangle  going  over

this  whole  thing  like  this

let  me  bring  the  opacity  of  that  all  the

way  up  grab  the  select  tool

lower  that  to  the  bottom  and  maybe  make

this  like  a  lighter  shade  of  gray  over

here  where  it  says  fill

im  going  to  select  hsl  and  im  gonna

look  at  this  l  row  like  this  and  just

bring  that  down  a  little  bit

and  then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the

text  and  uh  center  it  up

using  the  alignment  menu  so  im  gonna

open  up  the  align  and  distribute  menu

over  here  and  set  this  the  relative  to

set  it  to  last  selected  center  it  on  the

vertical  and  horizontal  axis  like  that

and  you  may  want  to  adjust  the  drop

shadow  drop  shadow  a little  bit  so  let

me  zoom  in  a little  more

let  me  just  bring  this  out

let  me  go  back  to  the  fill  and  stroke

menu  maybe  give  this

bring  the  opacity  of  it  up  now  since

its  on  a  darker  background

maybe  make  that  a  little  darker  and  i

think  i  will  call  it  a  day  right  there

so  that  should  do  it  for  this  tutorial

that  is  how  you  can  go  about  creating

that  gold  text

using  inkscape  so  if  you  have  any

questions  just  leave  a  comment  below  and

as  always  thanks  for  watching
