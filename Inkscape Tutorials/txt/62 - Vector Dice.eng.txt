this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  create  this  vector  dice

illustration

using  inkscape  and  if  youd  like  to

learn  more  about  how  inkscape  works  be

sure  to  check  out  my  inkscape  master

class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape

and  i  explain  what  they  are  and

demonstrate  how  they  work  ill  have  a

link  in  the  description  of  the  video  if

you  want  to  check  that  out

so  to  get  get  us  started  here  in

inkscape  the  first  thing  we  want  to  do

is  set  up  our  documents  so  that  we  are

all  working  with  a  similar  workflow

to  do  that  well  come  up  here  to  where

it  says  view  make  sure  you  have  custom

selected

and  then  well  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  zoom  and  zoom  in  at  one  to  one

and  then  up  here  in  the  snapping  menu  i

just  want  to  click  this  icon  over  here

to  the  top  left  that  says  enable

snapping  as  you  can  see  i  already  have

it  enabled

and  these  are  the  options  were  going  to

want  enabled  for  this  tutorial  right

here  where  it  says

snap  nodes  pads  and  handles  enable  that

and  then  over  here  where  it  says

snap  to  cusp  nodes  and  then  right  next

to  it  where  it  says  snap  to  smooth  nodes

and  once  weve  done  that  im  going  to

open  up  the  align  and  distribute  menu

with  this  icon

over  here  or  you  can  press  ctrl  shift  a

where  it  says  relative  to  i  want  to  set

that  to  last  selected

and  then  ill  open  up  the  um  fill  and

stroke  menu  over  here  with  this  icon  or

you  can  press  ctrl

shift  and  f  on  your  keyboard  to  get  that

open  so  once  we  have  that  open  the  first

thing  we  want  to  do  is  create  a  polygon

so  im  going  to  come  over  here  to  the

stars  and  polygons  tool

and  over  here  from  these  settings  i  want

to  choose  polygon  rather  than  star

where  it  says  corners  i  want  to  make

sure  we  have  six  and  then  rounded  and

randomized  both  set  to  zero  as  you  can

see  i  already  have  these  values

set  beforehand  you  will  probably  have  to

change  these  manually  so  go  ahead  and

type  those  in

and  once  you  do  that  just  click  and  drag

on  the  canvas  to  create  a  polygon  im

going  to  hold  ctrl

and  then  click  and  drag  the  mouse  up

like  that  so  that  it  creates  the  polygon

where  the  points

are  going  vertically  as  opposed  to

horizontally

that  right  there  is  what  were  looking

for  once  weve  done  that  im  going  to

take  this  move  this  towards  the  center

of  the  page

i  want  to  bring  the  opacity  of  this  down

a little  bit  im  going  to  take  this

opacity  over  here  and  just  drop  that

down  roughly  in  half  and  im  going  to

scale  this  down  a little  bit  im  going

to  hold  ctrl  and  shift

and  just  click  and  drag  to  scale  that

down

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  duplicate  so

im  going  to  right  click  this  and  go  to

duplicate

and  im  going  to  click  and  drag  this  up

here  until  these  two  corners  snap  so  we

get  something  like  this  here  where

theres  this  diamond  shape  intersecting

between  the  two  of  them

and  i  want  to  make  this  red  just  so  we

can  differentiate  it  from  the  original

then  i  want  to  duplicate  that  object

again  im  going  to  right  click  that  and

go  to  duplicate

come  over  here  snap  this  over  to  the

left  side  over  here

and  then  do  that  one  more  time  right

click  duplicate

and  snap  this  one  over  to  this  right

side  like  that  and  with  this  red

polygon  still  selected  im  going  to  go

to  edit

select  same  and  click  on  fill  color

its  going  to  select  all  of  the  objects

on  your  canvas  that  have  the  same

red  fill  which  is  these  three  objects

right  here  and  i  want  to  combine  those

together  by  going  to  path

combine  and  once  weve  done  that  i  just

want  to  click  and  drag  over

the  entire  thing  entirely  like  that  so

we  have  everything  selected  including

the  red

object  and  the  original  polygon  in  there

and  then  go  to  path

division  and  whats  going  to  happen

after  you  do  that  you  can  click  off  of

the  graphic  to  deselect  everything

youll  notice  this  has  been  broken  up

into  three  individual  parts  here  so  let

me  just  undo  that  by  hitting  ctrl

z  now  what  im  going to  do  is  im  going

to  create  three

individual  sides  for  the  dice  here  so  to

do  that  im  going  to  grab  the  squares

and  rectangles  tool

and  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift  on

the  keyboard  and  im  going  to  click  and

drag  to  create  a  perfectly  symmetrical

square  like  that

and  since  this  square  is  going  to

represent  one  of  the  sides  of  the  dice

what  i  want  to  do  is  round  the  corners

of  this  because  as  i  demonstrated  in  the

um

in  the  thumbnail  the  dice  has  rounded

corners  so  im  going  to  take  this  little

handle  up  here  to  the  top  right  this

circle  node

im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  that

down  like  that  so  we  get  some  nice

rounded

nice  rounded  corners  like  that  and  now  i

want  to  create  circles  for  the  inside  of

this

rectangle  that  represent  the  number  on

the  dice  so  im  going  to  grab  the

circles  and  ellipses  tool

hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  click  and  drag

to  create  a  perfectly  round  circle  like

that

i  want  to  make  this  a  different  color  so

ill  make  this  green

let  me  grab  the  select  tool  place  this

over  here  in  the  center

i  mean  the  top  left  right  click  that  go

to  duplicate

hold  control  click  and  drag  this  over  to

the  right  and  the  reason  why  im  holding

control  is  because  its  locking  it  onto

the  vertical  axis  like  that

and  then  i  want  to  hold  shift  and  click

on  the  other  one  so  we  have  them  both

selected

right  click  that  go  to  duplicate  hold

control  click  and  drag  these  ones  down

here

and  then  click  off  of  it  to  deselect

everything  and  then  just  take  one  of

these  right  here

right  click  them  and  go  to  duplicate  and

then  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  red  rectangle  so  that

you  have  the  circle  and  the  green

rectangle  uh  the  red  rectangle  selected

and  center  them  up

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis  like

that

now  if  you  notice  here  i  made  my  circles

a  little  too  big  so  what  im  going  to  do

is  im  just  going  to  click  and  drag  over

those  circles

hold  ctrl  and  scale  those  down  a  little

bit

ill  take  this  one  hold  shift  click  on

both  of  those

click  and  drag  these  down  here  click  off

of  the  deselect

ill  take  these  ones  as  well  again  shift

clicking  them  so  we  select  them  both

bring  them  over  here

and  let  me  try  this  again  ill  take  this

one  in  the  center  hold  shift

click  on  the  uh  the  red  rectangle  there

center  it  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis

thats  good  now  we  can  click  off  of  that

now  we  want  to  do  is  just  make  sure  that

we  have  these  green  ones  in  the  corners

centered  up  as  well  so  let  me  click  on

the  green  one  right  here

hold  shift  click  on  the  other  four  on

all  four  of  them  and  group  them  together

by  clicking  this  button  that  says  group

selected  objects

or  you  could  press  ctrl  g  and  then  hold

shift  and  click  on  the  red  rectangle  and

just  center  those  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  like  that

and  then  we  can  go  ahead  and  ungroup

them  so  this  right  here  is  going  to

represent  one  of  the  sides  of  the  dice

now  i  want  to  do  what  i  want  to  do  is

create  two  more  sides

so  to  do  that  im  going  to  click  and

drag  over  all  of  these

and  i  want  to  duplicate  them  by  going  to

right  click  by  right  clicking  and  going

to  duplicate

then  hold  ctrl  and  just  click  and  drag

this  over  here  to  the  right

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  everything

im  just  going  to  delete  these  two

circles  right  here  im  going  to

click  on  it  to  select  it  and  press

delete  same  thing  over  here  press  delete

so  then  we  end  up  with  the  number  three

and  then  finally  i  will  create  one  more

of  these

right  click  it  go  to  duplicate  hold  ctrl

click  and  drag  it  to  the  right

click  off  of  it  to  deselect  and  then  get

rid  of  these  on  the  uh

on  the  sides  here  so  that  we  have  just

the  one  in  the  middle

so  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  im  going

to  select  all  of  these  green  ones  right

here  im  going  to  click  and  drag  over

those  green

objects  to  make  sure  you  just  select  the

green  object  make  sure  you  dont

select  the  red  object  as  well  so  like

just  the  green  objects  right  there

unify  them  together  by  going  to  path

union

and  then  hold  shift  and  click  on  the  red

rectangle  and  go  to

path  difference  and  i  want  to  do  the

same  thing  over  here  select  all  of  these

go  to  path  union  hold  shift  click  on  the

red  rectangle  and  go  to  path

difference  and  then  finally  ill  come

over  here  click  on  the  green  circle

hold  shift  click  on  the  red  rectangle  we

dont  have  to  do  a  union  on  these  ones

because  its  just  one  object

and  go  to  path  difference  so  now  we  have

our  three  sides  to  the  dice  here  so  im

going  to

click  and  drag  over  all  of  these  let  me

hold  ctrl  and  shift  and  scale  these  down

and  i  want  to  place  these  over  where

theyre  going  to  be  implemented  so  im

going  to  take  this  top  one  the  number

five  put  this  on  top

im  going  to  take  this  over  here  the

number  three  put  this  on  the  left

and  ill  take  the  number  one  and  put

this  on  the  right  over  here  what  im

going  to  do  is

change  the  perspective  of  each  of  these

objects  so  that  they  fit  within  this

polygon

so  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  by  holding

ctrl  and  rolling  up  the  mouse  wheel

let  me  click  on  just  this  red  rectangle

right  here  and  go  to

path  path  effects  and  its  going  to  open

up  the  path  effects  menu  there  it  is

right  there

and  with  the  path  effects  menu  open  im

going  to  press  the  plus  icon

and  what  im  looking  for  is  perspective

so  im  going  to  come  up  here  to  where

the  search  icon  is  im  going  to  start

typing

p-e-r-s  and  there  we  go  perspective

envelope  thats  what  we  want

and  once  weve  done  that  come  over  here

to  the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool

and  what  were  looking  for  right  here  if

you  notice  theres  different  theres  two

different  types  of  nodes  theres  gray

nodes

inside  of  the  object  and  then  theres

white  nodes  on  the  corners  what  were

looking  for

is  the  white  nodes  on  the  corners  that

allows  us  to  change  the  perspective  so

let  me  zoom  back  out

again  to  zoom  in  and  out  im  just

holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  and  down  the

mouse  wheel

to  move  the  page  around  im  just

pressing  down  the  mouse  wheel  and  moving

the  mouse

let  me  take  this  white  node  and  snap

this  into  the

bottom  corner  of  this  top  object  let  me

take  this  white  node  and  snap  that  into

there

take  this  node  snap  it  into  there  and

then  this  one

into  there  like  that  and  now  i  will

finalize  that  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  now  lets  do  the  same

thing  over  here  lets  click  on  this

go  to  uh  were  going to  come  over  here

to  the  path  effects  menu

click  on  the  uh  the  plus  button  right

here

were  going  to  add  perspective  envelope

and  do  the  same  thing  im  going  to  take

this  corner  and  snap  it  into  here

take  this  corner  snap  it  into  here

this  corner  goes  down  here  and  this

corner  goes  in  here

and  again  finalize  that  by  going  to  path

object  to  path

and  then  i  will  do  the  same  thing  for

this  object  as  well  so  let  me  select

that

add  a  new  path  effect  perspective

envelope

and  then  snap  these  to  their  respective

corners  as  well

ill  put  this  one  down  there  and  then

again  were  going  to  finalize  this  by

going  to

path  object  to  path

so  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  im

going  to  hold  ctrl  roll  down  the mouse

will  zoom  out  let  me  grab  the  select

tool

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  put  a  little

bit  of  space  between  these  three  sides

because  theyre  all  touching  each  other

which  is  not

visually  correct  for  what  were  trying

to  create  so  let  me  select  each  of  these

red  objects  by  shift-clicking  them

and  then  just  move  them  off  of  the  uh

the  polygon

for  for  a  brief  moment  and  i  want  to

reduce  their  size  by  95

so  i want  to  come  up  here  to  where  it

says  width  and  height  or  w  and  h

i  want  to  turn  on  the  lock  right  here  so

it  locks  the  proportions  as  we  scale  it

and  right  here  these  units  of

measurement  where  it  says  px  im  going

to  change  that  to  percentage

and  im  going  to  change  the  width  to  95

so  were  going  to  reduce  the  size  by  95

i  mean  by  5  hit  enter  and  then  just

change  that  back  to  pixel  so  that  you

can

use  that  later  on  and  then  let  me  click

off  of  that  to  deselect  everything

i  want  to  take  this  object  right  here

hold  shift  click  on  the  left  side  of  the

polygon

center  it  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  do  the  same  thing  over

here  take  this  right

right  side  object  hold  shift  click  on

the  polygon

center  it  up  on  the  vertical  and

horizontal  axis  and  then  finally  the

same  thing  over  here  were  going  to

center  it  up

on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  axis  and

thats  what  were  looking  for  right

there  a  little  bit  of  space  between

those  uh

those  sides  of  the  dice  now  what  we  want

to  do  is  click  on

one  of  the  black  objects  in  the

background  the  original  polygon  youll

know  you  have  it  selected  when  you  see

the  black  stripe  down  here  in  the  bottom

left  make  sure  you  dont  accidentally

click  the

the  red  object  click  the  black  object  in

the  back  there

and  go  to  edit  select  same  and  click  on

fill  color

and  its  going  to  select  all  three  of

those  objects  and  we  want  to  unify  those

together  so  lets  go  to  path

union  and  now  im  just  going  to  scale

this  up  a  little  bit

if  you  notice  here  this  is  the  reason

why  were  going  to  scale  this  up  if  you

notice  here

the  padding  between  the  red  object  and

the  black  object

is  thinner  than  the  padding  between

these  two  red  objects

i  want  to  scale  this  up  so  that  it

matches  that  oops

i  want  to  scale  this  up  so  that  it

matches  that  a  little  more  closely  im

going  to  hold  ctrl  and  shift

and  just  scale  it  like  that  if  yours  is

too  big  you  may  have  to  scale  it  down

just  so  just  go  ahead  and  manually

adjust  it  so  it  looks  about  right

right  about  there  looks  pretty  good  and

what  i  want  to  do  now  is  round  to  the

corners

of  this  um  polygon  here  so  to  do  that

im  going  to  add  another  path  effect

and  the  path  effect  im  going  to  look

for  this  time  is  called  corners

corners  philip  chamfer  thats  what  were

looking  for  click  on  that

and  im  going  to  click  this  button  right

here  that  says  add  a  fillet  or  just

click

fill  it  and  now  im  going  to  come  back

over  here  to  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool

and  if  you  notice  were  going  to  have

these  green  nodes  in  each  corner  so  let

me  click  and  drag  over  all  of  those

green  nodes

let  me  zoom  in  a  little  bit  and  im  just

going  to  take  one  of  those  green  nodes

and  just  click  and  drag  and  if  you

notice  its  going  to  round  to  the  corner

as  we  do  that

and  that  right  there  is  what  were

looking  for  that  looks  perfect  so  let  me

finalize  that  by  going  to  path

object  to  path  let  me  grab  the  select

tool  we  can  close  out  of  the  path

effects  menu  now  we  shouldnt  need  that

again

so  we  have  the  structure  of  the  dice  in

place  all  we  have  to  do  now  is  color  it

in  so

let  me  take  this  top  object  right  here

and  let  me  break  it  apart  by  going  to

path

break  apart  and  then  i  want  to  hold

shift

and  click  on  the  large  red  object  so

that  we  just  so  that  it  deselects  it  and

we  just  have  these  circles  selected

and  i  want  to  raise  those  circles  to  the

top  by  clicking  this  button  that  says

raise  selection  to  the  top

and  im  going  to  make  those  white  and  i

want  to  do  the  same  thing  over  here

select  this  object

path  break  apart  hold  shift

click  on  that  red  object  to  deselect  it

make  these  white

and  then  raise  them  to  the  top  and  then

finally  the  same  thing  over  here  select

that

path  break  apart  hold  shift

click  on  the  object  to  deselect  it  make

that  white

raise  it  to  the  top  now  let  me  zoom  back

out  lets  click  and  drag  over  everything

and  bring  the  opacity  of  it  all  the  way

up  so  lets  click  off

to  deselect  everything  now  what  we  can

do  is  we  can  choose

colors  to  use  for  our  dice  i  know  in  the

thumbnail  i  use  the  color  green  i  think

for  this  one  ill  use  blue

you  can  use  whatever  color  youd  like  so

im  going  to  start  with  the  base  back

here  the  black  object

and  start  with  the  darker  variation  of

whatever  shade  you  want  to  use  if  you

want  to  make  your  dice  green  start  with

dark  green  if  you  want  to  make  it

orange  start  with  a  dark  orange  im

going  to  start  with  a  dark  blue

over  here  and  then  im  going  to  click

over  here  under  the  fill  tab  where  it

says

linear  gradient  im  going  to  click  that

to  give  it  a  linear  gradient

and  then  im  going  to  grab  the  gradient

tool  which  is  over  here  or  you  can  just

press

g  on  the  keyboard  and  if  you  notice  we

have  a  dark  blue  on  this  stop  and  we

have  transparency  on  this  stop  so  let  me

click  on  that  stop  to  select  it

and  i  want  to  make  this  a  lighter  shade

of  the  color  we  want  so  since  im  using

blue  im  going  to  go  with  lighter  shade

of  blue

let  me  put  this  stop  over  here  on  the

bottom  we  want  the  dark  one  on  the

bottom

take  this  one  the  lighter  one  on  top

hold  ctrl  bring  this  straight  up  so  that

it  locks  it  onto  the  vertical  axis  like

that

and  uh  it  may  be  helpful  to  turn  off

snapping  at  this  point  because  snapping

we  dont  need  it  anymore  and  its  just

going  to  get  in  the  way  from  this  point

forward  so

up  here  where  it  says  enable  snapping  we

can  disable  that

and  now  i  want  to  click  on  this  red

object  right  here  and  i  want  to  make

this  an  even  darker  color  than  the  dark

shade  of  blue

used  over  here  so  let  me  make  this  a

dark  shade  of  blue  like  that

that  looks  pretty  good  and  let  me  give

that  a  linear  gradient

and  i  want  to  take  this  dark  side  and

put  this  to  the  top  left  corner

take  this  one  bring  it  down  here  like

that

and  then  i  want  to  take  this  object

right  here  and  give  that  the  same

gradient  so  well  click  on  linear

gradient  and  instead  of  creating  that

again  we  can  just

choose  it  from  this  list  right  here  its

this  one  we  just  created

put  this  one  right  here  like  that  and

put  this  one  down  here  in  the

bottom  right  corner  there  we  go  and  then

up  here

were  going  to  use  an  even  lighter  shade

of  our  color  than  we  used  for  up  here  so

im  going  to  choose  an  even  lighter

shade  of  blue  like  that

or  maybe  that  looks  pretty  good  and  then

we  will  give  that  a  linear  gradient  as

well

take  this  and  put  this  down  here  and

then  take  the  transparent  stop  and  put

it  up  top  you  can  hold  control

to  lock  it  onto  the  vertical  axis  like

that  now  let  me  grab  the  select  tool  let

me  zoom  out  a  little  bit

if  you  can  see  our  dice  our  vector  dice

is  complete

what  you  can  do  now  is  click  and  drag

over  all  of  it

group  it  together  with  the  group

selected  objects  button

and  im  just  going  to  give  this  a  little

bit  of  a  tilt  to  make  it  look  like  it

was  just  thrown  so

let  me  select  this  let  me  click  on  it

until  we  get  the  rotation  handles

im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  take  this

corner  node  and  just  bring  this

counterclockwise  one  step

like  that  and  then  i  want  to  right  click

this  and  go  to  duplicate

ungroup  it  go  to  path

union  and  then  lets  make  this

black  click  on  it  again  to  get  back  to

the  scaling  handles  and  i  want  to  take

this

arrow  up  here  in  the  top  in  the  middle

and  then  just  bring  this  all  the  way

down  like  that

and  click  the  button  up  here  that  says
