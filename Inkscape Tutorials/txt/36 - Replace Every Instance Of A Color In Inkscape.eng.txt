so  lets  go  over  how  you  can  use

inkscape  to  replace  every  instance  of  a

single  color  on  a  document  all  at  once

if  you  see  from  my  example  design  here  I

have  this  assortment  of  objects  in  a

variety  of  colors  lets  say  I  want  to

take  every  object  with  this  salmon  color

right  here  and  change  it  to  a  yellow

shade  normally  to  do  that  I  would  have

to  click  on  each  object  individually  and

change  the  colors  one  by  one  which  can

be  a  pretty  tedious  and  time-consuming

task  depending  on  the  size  of  your

artwork

there  is  an  easier  way  to  go  about  doing

this  in  inkscape  though  in  order  to  do

this  what  Im  going  to first  do  is  Im

going  to click  on  one  object  right  here

that  contains  the  color  that  Id  like  to

change  with  the  object  selected  Im

going  to come  up  to  the  edit  menu  Ill

go  down  to  select  same  and  in  this  menu

over  here  to  the  right  you  should  see

all  of  these  different  attributes  that

you  can  choose  to  select  your  objects  by

so  for  example  if  I  choose  to  select  my

objects  by  fill  color

its  going  to  select  every  single  object

on  my  document  that  contains  that  fill

color  of  the  one  object  I  have  selected

and  to  change  that  color  now  all  I  have

to  do  is  apply  a  different  shade  like

that  and  as  you  can  see  every  single

color  has  been  replaced  with  the  color

that  I  chose  there  now  this  example  here

contains  several  colors  so  Ill  have  to

repeat  this  process  a  couple  of  more

times  Im  going  to  select  this  object  up

here  Ill  go  to  edit  select  same  and  if

you  look  over  here  you  can  see  all  of

these  different  properties  that  you  can

use  to  select  your  objects  by  you  could

select  by  fill  and  stroke  not  just  the

fill  you  can  select  by  just  the  fill

color  just  the  stroke  color  just  the

stroke  style  and  by  object  type  whether

it  be  a  square  or  a  circle  or  even  a

custom  drawn  path  with  the  bezier  pen

Im  just  going  to  use  fill  color  for

this  demonstration  and  Im  going  to

change  that  to  a  lighter  shade  of  yellow

and  then  Ill  change  this  color  of  this

object  right  here  Ill  go  to  edit  select

same

fill  color

and  Ill  change  this  to  a  darker  shade

of  yellow  maybe  something  a  little  off

like  orange  add  a  little orange  in  there

okay  that  looks  good

and  now  we  are  finished  as  you  can  see

its  as  simple  as  changing  colors

globally  on  your  document  is  as  simple

as  selecting  the  one  object  that

contains  that  color  and  then  using  the

edit  menu  to  select  every  other  object

so  that  is  how  you  can  go  about

performing  a  color  replace  using

inkscape  if  you  found  this  lesson  useful

master  class  its  a  collection  of  over

60  videos  where  I  go  over  all  of  the

tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  I

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  I  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

Community  where  you  can  ask  questions
