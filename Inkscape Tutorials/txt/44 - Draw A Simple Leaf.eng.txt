one  of  my  favorite  things  about  working

with  vectors  is  having  the  ability  to

make  complex  designs  out  of  simple

shapes  a  good  example  of  such  would  be

this  iconic  leaf  design  that  was  made

using  only  two  circles  a  square  and  a

little  bit  of  design  magic  in  todays

lesson  ill  be  showing  you  how

so  getting  us  started  here  the  first

thing  were  going  to  do  is  draw  our

circle  so  im  going  to  locate  the

circles  and  ellipses  tool  which  is

located  over  here

and  then  im  going  to  click  and  drag  on

the  canvas  while  holding  down  the

control  key  so  we  get  a  nice  perfectly

round  circle  like  that

now  what  im  going  to  do  is  open  up  the

fill  and  stroke  menu  which  is  located

over  here  or  you  can  press  ctrl  shift

and  f  to  open  that  up  and  it  should  open

up  on  the  right  hand  side  of  your  screen

over  here  now  you  can  use  these  sliders

to  make  this  whatever  color  youd  like

im  going  to  make  my  leaf  green  so  im

going  to  use  a  green  shade  over  here



there  we  go

and  what  im  going  to  do  now  is  reduce

the  opacity  of  this  circle  i  want  to

drop  this  down  roughly  in  half  because

its  important  that  were  going  to  see

through  the  shapes  that  were  about  to

work  with

once  youve  done  that  you  can  go  back  to

the  select  tool  over  here  and  what  i

want  to  do  is  right  click  on  this  object

and  go  to  duplicate  now  we  have  two

copies  of  it

so  now  im  going  to  hold  down  my  control

key  and  click  and  drag  this  shape  down

here  so  that  we  have  this  intersecting

area  between  these  two  circles  right

here  which  is  going  to  represent  our

leaf  shape  so  now  im  going  to  create  a

new  object  out  of  these  intersecting

areas  by  clicking  and  dragging  over  both

of  them  we  want  to  make  sure  we  have

both  of  them  selected  and  then  go  to

path  and  select  intersection

and  this  is  going  to  represent  part  of

our  leaf  anyway

so  now  were  going  to  create  this  stem

im  going  to  put  this  off  to  the  side

for  now  im  going  to  use  a  couple  of

squares  to  make  this  stem  im  going  to

grab  the  squares  and  rectangles  tool

which  is  over  here

click  and  drag  on  the  canvas  to  create

your  shape  hold  down  control  to  lock  the

aspect  ratio  so  we  get  a  nice

symmetrical  square  like  that

and  now  what  we  want  to  do  is  first  make

sure  that  the  corners  of  the  square  are

sharp  up  here  in  the  toolbar  this  icon

right  here  that  reads  make  corners  sharp

when  you  hover  your  cursor  over  it  if

its  grayed  out  then  that  means  your

corners  are  already  sharp  and  youre

good  to  go  if  you  have  rounded  corners

go  ahead  and  click  that  button  and  itll

make  your  corner  sharp

okay  so  lets  convert  this  to  a  path  now

lets  go  to  path  and  select  object  to

path

and  now  we  can  grab  the  nodes  tool  which

is  right  here  and  im  going  to  click  and

drag  over  this  node  right  here  to  select

it  and  im  going  to  press  delete  on  the

keyboard  to  get  rid  of  that  node

and  then  im  going  to  click  and  drag

over  the  remaining  three  nodes  and  make

them  sharp  by  clicking  on  this  button  up

here  that  says  make  selected  nodes

corner

and  now  we  have  this  triangle  shape  like

that

so  lets  go  back  to  our  select  tool

lets  give  this  a  different  color  so  we

can  differentiate  it  from  the  leaf  when

we  apply  it  over  im  going to  make  this

red

and  im  going  to  right  click  this  and  go

to  duplicate

and  im  going  to  make  this  one  a

different  color  ill  make  this  one  blue

and  then  ill  come  up  here  where  it  says

flip  selected  objects  vertically  ill  do

that  so  its  flipped  vertically  and  im

going  to  hold  ctrl  and  move  this  one

down  here  like  that  now  we  want  this  to

attach  to  this  right  here  so  im  going

to  temporarily  turn  on  snapping  which  is

this  little  magnet  icon  up  here  in  the

top  right  corner  and  then  you  should  be

able  to  just  click  and  drag  and  snap  it

in  place  like  that  and  then  we  also  want

to  flip  this  horizontally  so  come  over

here  where  it  says  flip  selected  objects

horizontally  and  select  that  this  is

what  were  looking  for  right  here

so  lets  turn  off  snapping  now

actually  no  you  know  what  lets  leave

that  on  for  now  im  going  to  click  and

drag  over  both  of  these  objects

im  going  to  group  them  together  by

going  to  object

and  selecting



and  then  im  just  going  to  take  this

bottom  node  right  here  or  this  bottom

handle  and  just  bring  this  up  so  that  we

end  up  with  a  shape  like  this  so  we  have

these  two  triangles  these  two  long

triangles  going  this  way

and  now  im  going  to  take  my  leaf  let  me

bring  this  over  here  let  me  make  this  a

little  bigger  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  and

im  going  to  click  and  drag  this  scaling

handle  right  here

to  scale  that  up

and  i  want  to  take  the  corners  this

corner  of  this  object  right  here  and

snap  it

into  this  corner  right  here  just  like

that  and  now  we  can  turn  off  our

snapping  because  if  we  leave  that

enabled  any  further  its  just  going  to

get  in  our  way

so  now  we  have  our  stem  in  place  im

just  going  to  hold  ctrl  and  move  this

over  like  this

i  might  even  make  this  a  little  more  a

little  longer  like  that

and  whats  how  this  works  is  this  red

object  is  going  to  represent  the  stem

and  this  blue  object  is  actually  going

to  be  used  as  negative  space  for  this

leaf  let  me  show  you  what  i mean  here

lets  ungroup  this  object  lets  go  to

object  and  select

ungroup  and  then  click  off  of  the

graphic  to  deselect  everything  im  going

to  select  just  this  blue  shape  right

here  and  then  im  going  to  hold  shift

and  click  on  the  green  leaf  right  there

so  we  have  both  of  them  selected  and  im

going  to  subtract  those  two  shapes  from

each  other  by  going  to  path

difference

and  now  we  end  up  with  something  like

that  right  there

so  lets  click  and  drag  over  everything

here  both  of  those  objects  and  go  to

path

union  and  now  we  have  our  base  shape  for

the  leaf  in  fact  we  can  take  the  opacity

of  this  and  bring  this  back  up  and  im

going  to  scale  this  down  im  going  to

hold  ctrl  and  to  lock  the  proportions

and  scale  that  down  like  that  so  we  have

a  rudimentary  leaf  here  were  going  to

make  this  look  a  little  more  whimsical

and  and  with  curved  edges  uh  by  using

the  pen  tool  so  let  me  uh  right  click  on

this  and  go  to  copy

or  the  pencil  tool  router  come  over  here

to  the  pencil  tool  or  the  draw  free  hand

lines  tool  you  can  use  the  letter  p  on

your  keyboard  to  access  that

and  up  here  where  it  says  shape  in  the

tool  setting  we  want  to  change  that  to

from  clipboard

and  the  smoothing  up  here  this  is

important  as  well  this  is  based  on  this

will  vary  based  on  your  screen

resolution  but  im  going  to  start  out

with  60  and  see  how  that  looks

and  now  what  im  going  to  do  is  im  just

going  to  click  and  drag  like  this  to

create

a  line  like  that  and  if  you  notice  it

took  that  strap  that  it  took  that  uh

shape  and  stretched  it  out  along  that

path

now  the  problem  here  is  that  the  the

leaf  is  way  too  thin  so  lets  come  over

here  to  the  edit  pads  my  nodes  tool

and  there  should  be  some  little  there

should  be  a  little  handle  right  here

that  you  could  just  pull  out  like  this

and  it  increases

the  size  of  your  leaf  as  you  can  see

here

and  this  right  here  is  the  effect  were

going  for

so  let  me  make  this  green

let  me  remove  the  stroke  by  holding

shift  and  clicking  on  the  red  x  over

here

and  now  im  going  to  grab  my  selection

tool  and  scale  this  down  to  size  a

little  more  a little  more  of  a  normal

size  like  that

and  now  what  im  going to  do  is  im

going  to  finalize  this  by  converting  it

to  a  path  ill  go  to  path

and  select  object  to  path

and  we  have  a  little  bit  of  a  whimsical

leaf  here  now  the  problem  is  im  not  too

happy  with  how  these  lines  look  they

dont  look  as  fluid  as  they  could  be  so

what  im  going to  do  is  im  going  to

manually  adjust  them  let  me  zoom  in  on

this  by  holding  ctrl  and  rolling  up  the

mouse  wheel

im  going  to  grab  my  edit  paths  by  nodes

tool  im  going  to  click  on  this  object

to  select  it  and  if  you  see  all  of  these

little  nodes  here  going  along  this  edge

im  going  to  select  all  of  those  nodes

im  going  to  hold  shift  while  doing  this

to  make  sure  i  can  select  multiple  nodes

at  a  time  and  we  want  to  have  only  these

nodes  selected  up  here  and  then  just

press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to  get  rid

of  them  and  now  you  should  have  these

two  handles  that  you  can  adjust

according  to  your  preference  so  i  want

to  give  this  more  of  a  fluid  contour

like  that  that  looks  a  lot  better  so  im

going to  do  the  same  thing  down  here  now

im  going  to  start  selecting  these  nodes

while  holding  shift  on  my  keyboard  so  i

can  select  multiple  nodes  at  a  time

and  then  press  delete  on  the  keyboard  to

get  rid  of  them

and  now  i  can  take  this  handle  and

manually  shape  it

however  i  please



okay  there  we  go  that  looks  a  lot  better

so  let  me  grab  the  selection  tool  im

gonna  press  one  on  the  keyboard  to  zoom

back  out  to  a  hundred  percent  and  there

you  go  now  we  have  one  of  our  leaves

okay  so  let  me  show  you  another  way  you

can  do  this  or  actually  let  me  just  show

you  how  to  make  another  leaf  of  another

uh  style

instead  of  drawing  the  curved  line  like

it  did  before  im  going  to  draw  like  a

u-shaped  line  so  i  should  still  have

this  copied  to  my  clipboard  we  do  have

the  settings  in  place  here  from

clipboard  im  just  going  to  click  and

drag  to  create  like  a  smiley  face  like

that

okay  that  didnt  come  out  as  expected

that  looks  really  sloppy  right  there  so

im  going  to  press  ctrl  z  to  undo  that

im  going  to  increase  the  smoothing  up

to  70.

and  try  that  again



okay  that  looks  a  little  better  that

thats  not  thats  still  not  what  im

looking  for  but  thats  enough  for  me  to

work  with  so  im  going to  leave  it  as  it

is  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool  let  me

scale  this  down  like  that  im  going  to

hold  ctrl  and  shift  while  scaling  so  i

could  scale  from  the  center  and  preserve

the  proportions

and  im  going  to  make  this  green

ill  remove  the  stroke  by  holding  shift

and  clicking  the  x

and  i  will  go  to  path

object  to  path

and  now  i  can  go  to  my  edit  pads  by

nodes  tool  and  let  me  zoom  in  and  clean

this  up  a  little  bit

press  the  delete  key  to  get  rid  of  those

nodes  just  like  we  did  before  same

process

take  this  handle  and

take  this  handle  and  bring  that  in  a

little  bit



there  we  go



and  then  i  will  take  these  handle  take

these  nodes  down  here  and  get  rid  of

them

just  like  i  did  before  just  to  make  this

more  smooth  i  missed  one  right  there  let

me  get  rid  of  that  one  there  we  go

so  let  me  adjust  this  handle

and  i  think  this  one  looks  pretty  good

yeah  thats  good  enough  and  once  youre

done  you  can  grab  the  selection  tool

zoom  out  to  100

by  pressing  one  on  the  keyboard  and

there  we  go  now  we  have  another  leaf

and  there  you  go  you  should  get  the  idea

you  can  draw  all  of  these  different

whimsical  style  leaves  by  grabbing  your

pencil  tool  over  here  and  drawing

different  contours  as  you  can  see  there

like  that  or  maybe  not  maybe  not  as

sloppy  but  you  get  the  idea

okay

so  there  we  go  let  me  take  this  one

scale  this  down



and  there  we  go  there  is  another  leaf

okay  so  now  we  have  all  of  these

different  leaves  and  different  shapes

going  in  different  directions  and

different  contours  and  you  could

actually  arrange  these  to  make  somewhat

of  a  pattern  or  you  can  use  these  for

logos  or  icons  or  whatever  else  youd

like

so  i  think  that  should  do  it  for  this

tutorial  that  is  how  you  can  draw  simple

iconic  leaves  using  inkscape  before  i

end  this  video  if  you  found  this  lesson

useful  then  consider  checking  out  my

inkscape  master  class  its  a  collection

of  over  60  videos  where  i  go  over  all  of

the  tools  and  features  in  inkscape  and  i

explain  what  they  are  and  demonstrate

how  they  work  kind  of  like  how  i  did  in

this  video  we  even  have  a  private

community  where  you  can  ask  questions

and  get  help  from  me  anytime  you  want

and  best  of  all  theres  no  monthly

membership  fees  you  just  pay  17  one  time

and  youre  in  for  life  ill  have  some

information  about  that  in  the

description  of  the  video  if  you  want  to

check  that  out  as  always  thanks  for
