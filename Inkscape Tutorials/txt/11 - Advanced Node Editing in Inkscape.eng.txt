in  this  video  Ill  be  demonstrating  some

of  the  more  advanced  Transformations

that  you  can  make  when  working  with

nodes  and  inkscape  by  showing  you  how  to

create  this  cassette  tape  design  and

this  will  be  more  of  an  advanced

tutorial  in  that  Im  not  going  to  be

going  over  every  step  in  fine  detail  but

if  youre  already  somewhat  familiar  with

the  software  you  should  be  able  to  get  a

sense  of  what  Im  doing  as  I  go  through

these  steps  so  Im  going  to  come  over

here  into  new  document  and  get  started

Im  going  to  draw  a  rectangle  to  start

off  and  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool

Im  going  to  make  this  rectangle  I

believe  I  used  400  by

250  and  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  let  me  go

back  to  my  rectangle  tool  Im  going  to

make  these  Corners  a  little

rounded  there  we  go  and  now  Im  going  to

put  some  circles  in  the  corners  to  uh

serve  as  screws  the  screws  in  the

corners  of  the  uh  cassette  tape  so  Ill

put  that  right  there  and  Ill  make  a  few

copies  of  this  Im  going  to  press

controll  D  or  command  D  to  duplicate  it

move  this  over

here  make  another  duplicate  of  these

bring  these  down  here

and  Im  going  to  group  these  together

and  Im  going  to  Center  this  up  on  the

document  here  so  let  me  open  this  up  and

Center  it  so  now  I  have  the  four  screws

centered  in  the  uh  corners  of  the

cassette  tape  as  you  can  see  here  thats

uh  this  part  of  the  design  so  let  me

come  back  in  here  and  next  Im  going  to

create  the  bottom  part  this  uh  this

little  bottom  part  of  the  design  right

here  so  Im  going  to  grab  my  rectangle

tool  again  and  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  to  draw  a

rectangle  and  Im  going  to  make  the

corners  of  this  one  Shar  for  now  Im

going  to  go  back  and  make  those  Corners

rounded  later  on  but  I  first  want  to

change  the  I  want  to  distort  the  shape

of

this  so  Ill  convert  this  to  a

path  grab  my  nodes  tool  and  I  want  to

grab  these  two  nodes  right  here  and  let

me  scale  those  down  I  dont  know  why

that  just  layered  beneath  the  other

object  but  Ill  have  to  raise  that  up

again  let  me  move  that

up  okay  that  looks  good  right  there  I

want  to  round  these  Corners  a  little  bit

so  Im  going  to  come  over  here  and

choose  the  uh  this  handy  new  feature  the

corner  is  live  path  effect  Im  going  to

select  all  of  the

nodes  and  Im  going  to  scale  let  me  turn

off  the  scaling  handles  and  Im  going  to

bring  this  in  like  this  just  to  make

these

rounded  there  we  go  and  I  just  want  to

make  sure  that  this  is  centered  there  we

go  and  Im  going  to  put  some

more  Im  going  to  put  these  uh  these

little  round  parts  of  the  design  in

there  now  so  let  me  come  back  over  here

and  for  that  Ill  just  duplicate  let  me

ungroup  these  circles  Im  just  going  to

duplicate  these  circles  and  use  these

copies  to  make  those  uh  to  make  those

parts  of  the  design  Ill  scale  that

up  duplicate  that  control  D  or  command  D

is  the  shortcut  for  duplicating  very

handy  shortcut  to

know  move  that  over  let  me  zoom  out  a

little  bit  to  see  how  that  looks  in

proportion  I  guess  that  looks  pretty

good  maybe  Ill  make  it  a  little

smaller  and  Im  going  to  duplicate  the

these  and  I  will  flip  these  horizontally

and  move  these  over  here  and  now  I  want

to  Center  this  up  on  the  uh  bottom  part

of  this  design  here  so  let  me  group  that

and  Ill  Center  these

together  let  me  move  that  down  it  looked

better  down  there  there  we  go  now  I  can

ungroup

them  okay  so  the  next  part  of  the  design

I  will  make  is  Ill  make  this  inner  part

of  the  cassette  tape  or  the  label  so  let

me  come  back  in  here  Im  going  to  grab

my  rectangle  tool  and  Im  going  to  make

a  rectangle  in  the  uh  on  the  inside  of

the  uh  cassette  tape  there  and  let  me

just  make  sure  I  have  this  centered  up

on  the  other  rectangle  there  we  go  and

Im  going  to  change  this  a  little  bit

let  me  make  this  a  little  less  tall

vertically  and  I  want  to  convert  this  to

a  path  as  well  and  now  to  make  the

corners  have  this  cut  off  effect  were

going  to  use  a  path  effect  for  that  so

let  me  come  back  over  here  to  my  nodes

tool  and  I  want  to  enable  the  Corners

live  path  effect  again  and  I  want  to

select  both  of  these  and  now  I  can  roll

them  down  like  that  now  the  corners  are

rounded  right  now  but  thats  okay  were

going  to  go  in  and  change  that  setting

so  Im  going  to  open  up  the  path  effects

menu  path  path

effects  and  now  I  should  be  able  to

change  the  corners  to  chamfer  and  now  I

have  those  squared  Corners  that  I

preferred  let  me  make  those  a  little

less  let  me  scale  those  down  a  little

bit  oh  okay  that  looks  good  now  we  can

close  out  of  that  uh  let  me  get  out  of

that  and  the  next  part  I  guess  I  will

make  I  Ill  start  working  on  the  little

spindles  here  in  the  center  this  is  uh

probably  the  most  elaborate  part  of  this

whole  thing  so  lets  go  get  that

started  Im  going  to  grab  my  circles  and

ellipses  tool  and  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  to  draw  a

circle  and  let  move  this  over  Im  going

to  duplicate  this  circle  make  this

circle  a  little

smaller  and  Im  going  to  make  these

teeth  that  go  on  the  inside  of  the  uh

the  spindle  there  so  let  me  deselect

everything  and  to  do  this  Im  going  to

use  clones  and  this  is  going  to  make  it

a  lot  easier  to  adjust  things  Ill  show

you  what  I  mean  here  Im  going  to  click

and  drag  to  draw  a  rectangle  its  going

to  represent  one  of  the  teeth  of  this  uh

of  the  spindle  and  Im  going  to  right

click  this  and  go  to  instead  of

duplicate  Im  going  to  use  clone  and  Im

going  to  take  the  Clone  copy  and  Im

going  to  bring  it  down

here  and  I  just  want  to  group  both  of

these  together  make  sure  I  have  them

centered  on  the  circle  so  let  me  come

back  over  here  to  my  aligned  distribute

menu  and  now  Im  going  to  clone  these

again  so  Im  going  to  right  click  and  go

to  clone  and  Im  going  to  rotate  this

copy  that  many  steps  and  then  Ill  clone

that  again  so  Ill  right  click  that  go

to  clone  and  Ill  rotate  it  hold  the

control  key  and  just  rotate  it  around

like  that  there  we  go  now  the  reason  I

did  that  is  because  if  I  want  to  change

the  width  of  these  teeth  sometimes

youll  make  it  too  big  or  too  small

without  realizing  it  uh  youll  have  to

go  back  and  undo  all  of  it  when  you  use

clones  though  you  can  just  adjust  one  of

them  and  it  adjusts  all  of  them  so  Im

going  to  hold  my  shift  key  and  scale

this  part  in  like  that  and  its  going  to

change  the  size  of  all  the  other  teeth

like  that  so  let  me  move  that  out  a

little  bit  it  looks  better  in  a  larger

size  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit  its

hard  to  really  perfectly  visualize  how

its  going  to  look  until  you  unify  it

with  the  other

shape  let  me  try  that  one  more

time  okay  I  think  Ill  leave  that  as  it

is  Im  going  to  select  all  of  these  now

I  have  all  of  them  selected  and  Im

going  to  unlink  the  Clones  so  Ill  go  to

edit  and  I  will  choose  clone  and  I  will

select  unlink  clone  and  now  I  can

ungroup  them  well  go  to  object  ungroup

and  unify  them  all  together  path  Union

and  then  subtract  it  from  that  smaller

Circle  so  Ill  hold  shift  and  click  on

that  Circle  and  go  to  path  difference

and  now  we  have  the  teeth  of  the  uh  of

that  wheel  there  let  me  scale  that  up  a

little

bit  and  Ill  take  this  part  and  scale

this

down  and  now  Im  going  to  create  the  uh

the  tape  going  around  the  uh  the  wheel

here  so  let  me  Zoom  back  out  let  me  come

back  in  here  and  Ill  take  this  larger

Circle  Im  going  to  remove  the  fill  and

Im  going  to  make  a  duplicate  of  this

Im  going  to  press  command  D  and  then

hold  control  and  shift  and  scale  this  up

about  that  much  and  Im  going  to  take

both  of  these  circles  now  and  Im  going

to  combine  them  together  so  Ill  go  to

path  and  I  will  choose  combine  and  now

Im  going  to  apply  the  interp

interpolate  path  effects  so  Im  going  to

come  over  here  to  my  path  effects  menu

and  Im  looking  for

interpolate  uh  interpolate  interpolate

sub  paths  not  points  the  one  they  use

here  is  sub  paths  and  now  I  can  increase

or

decrease  the  uh  number  of  paths  between

those  circles  I  think  this  looks  good

with  seven  for  now  but  Im  going  to  go

back  and  change  that  later  as  I  adjust

things  so  for  now  that  looks  good  Ill

leave  it  at

seven  and  next  I  will  Im  going  to  make

a  duplicate  copy  of  this  and  move  this

over  here  so  we  have  two  of  these  now  so

Im  going  to  select  all  of  these  let  me

group  it  together  let  me  duplicate  this

and  just  move  this  one  over  like

that  and  then  Ill  group  these  together

and  then  Center  them  on  this  uh  larger

rectangle  and  that  looks  pretty

good  okay  let  me  ungroup  those

now  and  now  Im  going  to  trim  off  the

edges  Im  going  create  Im  going  to

create  the  inner  part  like  the  window  I

guess  you  can  call  it  of  this  cassette

tape  and  Im  going  to  trim  off  all  of

the  other  excess  areas  so  let  me  come

back  in  here  and  to  do  that  Im  going  to

turn  on  my  snapping  and  Im  going  to

draw  a

rectangle  Ill  start  the

rectangle  up  here  and  Ill  end  it  down

here  like  that  and  Im  going  to  grab  my

selection  tool  now  and  Im  going  to  snap

it  to  the  right  Edge  and  then  snap  it  to

the  left  Edge  basically  Im  creating  a

rounded  rectangle  that  goes  around  the

two  wheels  of  the  cassette  tape  so  Im

going  to  grab  my  rectangle  tool  now  and

round  the

corners  there  we  go  thats  the  effect

Im  going  for  and  what  Ill  do  next  is

Im  going  to  convert  this  to  a  path

well  get  to  path  object  to

path  grab  my  selection  tool  and  Im

going  to  duplicate  this  and  now  I  want

to  select  all  of  the  wheels  Im  going  to

select  the  uh  Im  going  to  select  this

wheel  right  here  and  Im  going  to  hold

shift  and  select  this  wheel  right  here

and  I  want  to  group  them  all  together  by

pressing  command  G  or  contr  G  and  I  want

to  take  this  duplicate  copy  and  then

select  the  grouped  wheels  and  go  to

object  clip  set  clip  so  now  it  is  a

clipped  object  and  what  I  could  do  now

is  I  can  take  this  rectangle  and

duplicate  that  well  go  to  duplicate  and

I  will  apply  an  offset  to  that  so  I  will

go  to  path  and

choose  Dynamic

offset  let  me  go  to  my  nodes  tool  Im

going  to  take  this  node  and  bring  that

out  let  me  turn  off  my  snapping  for  now

and  I  think  that  looks  pretty  good  as  it

is  I  think  Ill  will  leave  it  like  that

now  I  want  to  create  some  asymmetry

between  these  two  wheels  here  if  you

notice  in  my  original  design  theres

more  tape  on  this  wheel  than  there  is  on

this  wheel  so  thats  the  effect  I  want

to  uh  I  want  to  create  to  do  that  Im

going  to  uh  and  this  is  where  path

effects  really  come  in  handy  because

this  is  still  editable  as  a  path  effect

so  if  I  go  to  my  nodes  tool  I  can  still

select  this  and  Im  going  to  select

these  nodes  Im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  them  and  Ill  turn  on  my

transformation  handles  and  now  I  can

scale  this  up  like  that  and  all  those

other  circles  in  there  scale  with  it  the

problem  is  that  there  are  a  little  more

SPAC  out  so  Im  going  to  go  back  into  my

uh  path  effects  menu  and  add  some  more

sub  paths  in

there  and  Ill  do  the  opposite  over  here

Ill  maybe  shrink  this  one  down  a  little

bit  let  me  move  this

over  and  let  me  select  these

nodes  and  Ill  scale  these  ones

down  and  now  I  will  remove  some  of  those

sub  paths  in  there  to  make  it  look

evenly  spaced  out  with  the  other  ones  so

that  looks  a  lot  better  I  think  let  me

turn  off  the  uh  transformation

handles  and  that  looks  a  lot  better  we

have  some  asymmetry  there  now  between

those  two  uh  objects  now  I  just  want  to

size  this  up  so  it  fits  the  cassette

tape  overall  and  uh  and  its  nicely

aligned  um  you  know  what  before  I  do

that  lets  trim  off  all  of  this  other

excess  stuff  because  if  I  go  to  my  nodes

tool  you  can  see  if  I  hover  my  cursor

these  other  lines  still  exist  with

within  the  clip  you  just  dont  see  them

because  theyre  hidden  behind  the

clipping  mask  that  we  created  I  want  to

finalize  these  and  make  these  um  like

plain  Vector  paths  so  to  do  that  Im

going  to  select  this  all  and  Im  going

to  come  over  here  into  the  shape  Builder

tool  and  now  Im  just  going  to  build  the

shape  that  I  want  out  of  this  so  Im

going  to  click  on  this  part  to  add  that

and  everything  that  I  make  blue  is  going

to  be  what  gets  kept  and  everything

thats  not  blue  will  be  deleted  so  Im

going  to  combine  all  of  this

together

and  Im  making  separate  shapes  out  of

each  of  these  because  I  want  everything

in  here  to  be  its  own  shape  so  I  can  add

color  to  it  which  you  will  see  in  just  a

few  minutes  so  that  right  there  is  what

Im  going  for  I  want  everything  divided

into  its  own  shape  and  if  I  go  back  to

my  selection  tool  now  it  is  everything

uh  its  designed  just  how  I  want  it  so  I

have  these  individual  shapes  here  that  I

can  edit  and  work  with  however  I  need  so

now  that  thats  done  let  me  select

everything  here  and  group  it  together

and  I  want  to  center  it  up  over  this

rectangle  so  let  me  come  back  into  my

alignment  tab  and  I  may  have  to  make

this  one  a  little  bigger  relative  to  the

relative  to  the  uh  the  tape  because

normally  the  wheel  goes  out  almost  past

the  corner  of  this  uh  part  of  the  tape

right  here  so  I  got  to  make  mine  oops

let  me  undo  that  I  got  to  make  mine  a

little  bigger  uh  maybe  not  bigger  but

longer  so  let  me  ungroup  everything  Im

going  to  grab  my  nodes  tool  and  Im

going  to  select  these  nodes  over  here

and  Ill  just  move  these  over  like

that  and  now  were  elongating  it  without

having  to  um  scale  it  so  let  me  group  it

together  now  and  let  me  try  centering  it

again  see  if  it  looks  any  better  and

thats  more  along  the  lines  of  what  Im

going  for  you  know  what  I  think

something  got  taken  off  center  here  let

me  redo  that  this  is  one  of  the

downsides  of  working  with  a  trackpad  if

Im  working  with  the  mouse  I  dont  have

that  problem  so  now  lets  uh  lets  make

these  little  lines  right  here  this  this

is  like  a  blank  label  where  you  can

write  in  your  own  label  on  the  cassette

tape  Im  going  to  grab  the  pen  tool  to

make

those  hold  control  so  we  get  a  straight

line  press  enter  to  close  the  path  and

Im  going  to  make  this  the  same  size  as

The  Strokes  on  the  other  shapes  which  is

three  so  Ill  come  back  over  here  stroke

style  tab  make  this  three  pixels  I  want

this  to  have  rounded

caps  and  Ill  make  a  duplicate  of  this

and  bring  this  down  here  so  Im  going  to

hold  the  control

key  that  looks  good  maybe  Ill  make  this

a  little

bigger  and  Im  just  going  to  size  this

up  and  adjust  it  until  it  looks

right  okay  there  we  go  so  Im  going  for

a  nice  balanced  look  here  where

everything  is  spaced  up  spaced  out

nicely  Im  going  to  ungroup  that  now  and

the  cassette  tape  part  of  the  design  is

finished  now  I  want  to  create  this  um

this  rainbow  ribbon  background  here  that

I  put  behind  the  cassette  tape  so  let  me

come  back  over  here  for  this  I  want  to

make  sure  I  have  my  snapping  enabled  and

Im  going  to  grab  my  rectangle  tool  and

Im  going  to  draw  a  elongated

rectangle  and  Im  going  to  make  the

corner  Sharp  and  I  want  to  make  cop  I

want  to  make  five  copies  of  this  so  Im

going  to  press  control  D  to  make  a  copy

Ill  snap  this  copy  over  here  to  the

left  end  or  to  the  right  end  and  Ill

just  repeat  this  until  I  have  five

copies  there  we  go  let  me  select  all  of

those  convert  them  to  a

path  path  object  to  path  and  now  Im

going  to  do  Im  going  to  duplicate  these

and  Im  going  to  put  these  down  here  and

snap  these  to  the  bottom  and  this  time

Im  going  to  go  with  combin  so  Ill  go

with  uh  path  and  and  I  will  choose

combine  and  Im  going  to  move  this

up  and  now  I  want  to  use  the  perspective

path  effect  to  make  this  uh  wider  so  Im

going  to  come  back  over  here  to  my  path

effects  and  Im  looking  for

perspective  there  we  go  grab  my  nodes

tool  I  want  to  lock  this  in  the  uh  or

mirror  it  in  the  vertical  axis  and  now  I

can  just  scale  that  out  like

that  that  looks  pretty  good  now  Im

going  to  convert  that  to  a  path  as  well

we  go  to  path  object  to  path  grab  my  S

ction  tool  and  I  want  to  break  this

apart  so  Ill  go  to  path  and  I  will

choose  break  apart  and  now  these  should

already  be  broken  apart  yeah  I  need

these  to  be  individual  objects  so  what

Im  going  to  do  is  Im  going  to  start

unifying  these  objects  together  Im

going  to  hold  my  option  key  or  ALT  key

and  just  draw  a  line  between  those  two

objects  unify  them  together  by  going  to

path  Union  or  the  keyboard  shortcut  is

control  shift  and  the  plus  key  so  Im

just  going  to  use  that  for  the  rest  of

these  were  going  to  repeat  this  process

Im  going  select  those  unify  those

together

do  the  same  thing  over  here  oops  let  me

un  deselect

that  control  shift  plus

deselect  select  these  ones  and  there  you

go  one  more  to

go  okay  so  thats  what  were  going  for

now  and  to  make  these  rounded  what  I

will  do  is  I  want  to  select  all  of  them

first  so  Im  going  to  hold  shift  and

click  on  each  of

these

and  I  want  to  combine  these  together  so

Ill  go  to  path  and  I  will  choose

combine  let  me  move  move  this  out  of  the

way  of  the  cassette  tape  Im  going  to

turn  off  the  snapping  now  and  Im  going

to  go  back  to  the  nodes  tool  and  Im

going  to  turn  on  the  corner  live  path

effect  for  this  and  Im  going  to  select

these  nodes  right  here  let  me  try  that

again  there  we  go  and  Im  just  going  to

round  this  like  that  so  we  get  a  nice

rounded  effect

there

okay  that  looks  good  Ill  leave  that  as

it  is  and  now  Im  going  to  go  into  my

shape  Builder  tool  and  Im  just  going  to

click  on  each  of  these  one  by  one  to

make  sure  that  they  are  all  separate

shapes  and  that  they  no  longer  have  the

path  effect  applied  theyre  just  plain

Vector  pads  and  there  you  go  now  were

finished  so  let  me  go  back  over  here  now

and  I  could  take  this  and  move  this  over

here  you  know  what  let  me  leave  this

here  Im  going  to  take  the  cassette  tape

group  it  together  and  place  it  over  on

top  of  uh  this  backdrop  here  I  want  to

raise  this  up  so  its  layered  above

it  and  Im  going  to  Center  both  of

these  and  the  final  step  is  to  just  add

some  color  as  you  can  see  that  Ive  done

over  here  in  my  original  design  so  let

me  come  back  in  here  Im  going  to  start

coloring  this  thing  in  so  Ill  start

with  these  stripes  down  here  let  me

ungroup  these  or  break  them  apart  rather

object  path  break

apart  and  for  the  colors  it  was  just  red

orange  yellow  green  and  blue  so  Ill  add

some  variation  of  those  Shades  let  me

start  with  this

one  and  now  Im  going  to  start  adding

some  color  to  the  cassette  tape  so  let

me  ungroup  that

now  and  I  want  to  change  the  color  Im

going  to  use  this  object  right  here  as  a

starting  point  Ill  make  that  one  white

and  Ill  make  this  one  white  as  well  and

the  smaller  shape  inside  of  it  Im  going

to  hold  my  ALT  key  to  select  that

smaller  shape  and  Im  going  to  make  this

a  dark  shade  of  gray  about  as  dark  as  it

can  get  without  it  Contra  without  it

losing  its  contrast  with  the  black

stroke  so  Im  going  to  go  with  a  really

dark  shade  let  me  go  over  here  to  my

fill  and  stroke  menu  and  adjust  this

manually  make  it  a  little  darker  that

looks  pretty  good  and  Im  going  to  use

this  shade  for  a  lot  of  other  things  so

Im  going  to  select  this  one  over  here

use  the  same  color  with  my  dropper  tool

and  I  will  select  this  shape  in

here  let  me  try  that  again  there  we  go  I

want  to  make  that  the  same  color  and  I

want  to  make  all  of  these  wheels  that

same  color  or  that  same  shade  of  gray

rather  there  we  go  and  I  could  take  this

rectangle  Im  going  to  make  this  a

darker  shade  of  gray  Ill  make  this  a

lighter  shade  of

gray  and  Ill  make  this  one  over  here  a

much  lighter  shade  of  gray  its  going  to

be  gray  but  its  going  to  be  much

lighter  and  now  Im  going  to  take  the  uh

well  Im  going  to  take  this  shape  right

here  Ill  start  here  and  I  will  make

this  the  same  shade  of  gray  that  this

cassette  tape  is  and  now  I  can  take  the

tape  inside  of  here  or  the  rolls  of  uh

tape  and  Im  going  to  select  all  of

those  and  make  them  this  shade  maybe

Ill  make  these  a  little  bit

darker  and  then  Ill  do  the  same  thing

over  here  with  these  ones  Ill  select

these  ones  as

well  and  Im  not  quite  satisfied  with

the  contrast  between  these  darker  Shades

of  Gray  so  let  me  make  those  a  little

darker  Im  going  to  select  that  and  I

want  to  apply  this  to  all  of  the  other

objects  that  have  that  color  so  Ill  go

to  edit  select  same  and  Ill  choose  fill

color  and  now  that  I  have  those  all

selected  I  can  change  the  shade  and

darken  it  as

needed  okay  that  looks  good

enough  all  right  so  I  guess  one  last

step  would  be  to  add  a  background  as

Ive  done  here  let  me  just  go  back  in

here  Im  going  to  turn  on  snapping  to  do

this  makes  it  a  lot  easier  Ill  snap  to

this  corner  and  then  Ill  snap  to  this

corner  up  here  and  now  I  can  just  grab

my  selection  tool  and  scale  this  out  as

needed  again  using  the  snapping  controls

let  me  send  this  to  the

bottom  let  me  make  this  a  shade  of

yellow  Ill  use  this  as  a  starting  point

but  I  want  it  to  be

lighter  and  there  you  go  that  should  do

it  for  this  tutorial  thats  how  you  can

use  some  of  the  more  advanced  uh  node

editing  features  in  in  incap  to  create

something  like  this  cassette  tape  design
