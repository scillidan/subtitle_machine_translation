in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over  how

you  can  Arch  text  in  inkscape  to  create

this  classic  athletic  t-shirt  design

and  if  you  just  want  to  know  how  to  arch

text  then  you  could  skip  to  that  part  of

the  lesson  using  the  chapters  in  the

play  bar  below

if  you  do  want  to  recreate  this  design

just  make  sure  to  download  and  install

this  font  that  Ill  have  Linked  In  the

description  of  the  video

so  Ill  come  over  here  into  a  new

document  and  get  started  the  first  thing

we  want  to  do  is  add  some  text  so  Im

going  to  grab  my  text  tool  and  Im  going

to  click  on  the  canvas  and  Im  going  to

type  inkscape

and  then  Im  going  to  click  again  to

create  another  text  item  and  Im  going

to  write  the  EST  date  which  is  2003.

and  then  Ill  come  down  here  and  make

one  more  text  item  that  has  the  tagline

which  is  draw  freely

and  once  you  do  that  lets  go  back  to

the  select  tool  lets  select  all  three

text  items  and  change  their  font  so  Ill

come  up  here  to  text  and  I  will  select

text  and  font

and  from  this  menu  were  looking  for  the

varsity  team  font  as  its  called  so  let

me  locate  that  highlight  it  and  then

click  apply

and  now  Im  just  going  to  resize  my  text

items

accordingly  so  Im  going  to  make  this

one  a  little  bigger  Ill  keep  this  one  a

little  smaller  and  Ill  make  this  one

the  biggest  ad  the  biggest  of  them  all

now  make  sure  to  hold  your  control  key

while  youre  scaling  to  ensure  that  you

preserve  the  aspect  ratio

and  now  Im  going  to  create  a  rounded

rectangle  to  place  behind  this  text  here

so  let  me  grab  my  rectangle  tool  Im

going  to  click  and  drag  over  the  object

to  create  the  rectangle

and  Im  going  to use  this  little  round

handle  up  here  in  the  top  right  corner

to  round  the  corners  of  this  rectangle

rectangle  ever  so  slightly

and  then  I  will  grab  my  selection  tool

and  place  this  beneath  the  text  so  Ill

click  on  this  button  over  here  that  says

lower  selection  one  step

now  Im  just  going  to  size  this  up

according  to  the  text  there

and  now  Im  going  to  select  both  and  Im

going  to  align  them  so  let  me  open  up

the  Align  and  distribute  menu  by  going

to  object  and  selecting  align  and

distribute

and  Im  going  to  choose  relative  2  and

Im  going  to  align  it  vertically  and

horizontally

and  with  the  items  still  selected  lets

go  to  path  and  select  difference  and

what  thats  going  to  do  is  subtract  the

text  from  the  rectangle  and  now  this

rectangle  has  empty  space  in  it  in  the

shape  of  those  letters  so  that  any

backdrop  that  you  place  it  on  top  of

will  show  through  where  those  letters

are

so  let  me  zoom  out  Im  going  to  make  all

of  this  the  same  color  Im  going  to

select  everything  here  and  choose  a

color  that  Id  like  to  work  with  if  you

want  to  choose  a  different  color  other

than  what  you  see  down  here  you  can  open

up  your  fill  and  stroke  menu  just  double

click  this  color  stripe  over  here  and

itll  open  up  the  fill  and  stroke  menu

and  Im  going  to  choose  my  color

there  we  go  and  now  I  just  want  to  make

sure  that  everything  here  is  aligned  so

Im  going  to come  over  here  to  the  align

the  distribute  menu  and  Im  going  to

align  it  vertically  and  let  me  make

these  items  a  little  closer  together

Im  just  going  to  move  them  up  like  that

now  again  to  select  multiple  objects  I

click  I  click  on  them  while  holding

shift  and  while  Im  moving  them  Im

holding  the  control  key  to  ensure  that

they  are  locked  to  the  vertical  axis

there  and  they  do  not  lose  their

alignment

and  once  youve  done  that  lets  apply  an

arch  to  this  text  right  here  so  Im

going  to  click  on  the  text  to  select  it

and  Im  going  to  convert  it  to  a  path  by

going  to  path  and  selecting  object  to

path

and  now  I  will  open  up  the  pathfx  menu

so  lets  come  back  up  here  to  path  and

lets  choose  pathfx

from  the  pathfx  menu  Im  going  to  choose

the  envelope  deformation  option  which  is

right  here

and  in  the  settings  menu  I  want  to

disable  this  setting  right  here  that

says  enable  left  and  right  paths  we  only

want  to  enable  the  top  and  bottom  for

what  were  doing  here  so  let  me  deselect

that  and  then  click  on  this  button  right

here  that  says  Top  Bend  path

and  once  you  do  that  youll  get  this

little  green  line  at  the  top  of  the

object  here  and  if  you  hover  your  cursor

over  you  can  click  and  drag

to  bend  the  text  up  like  that

and  then  well  do  the  same  thing  here

well  choose  the  bottom  bent  path  and

well  bend  that  text  up  like  that

and  just  like  that  we  have  arced  our

text  so  let  me  grab  my  selection  tool

lets  move  these  items  up  a  little  bit

and  Im  just  going  to  Center  this  up  one

more  time  just  to  make  sure  everything

is  still  aligned

and  now  Im  going  to  make  this  much

bigger  because  if  youre  going  to  print

this  on  a  shirt  youre  going  to  want

this  design  to  be  really  big  so  let  me

make  this  a  lot  bigger

again  holding  the  control  key  while  I

scale  to  ensure  that  everything  remains

proportionate  and  now  Im  going  to

resize  my  document  to  match  this

selection  right  here  so  with  everything

selected  Im  going  to  press  Ctrl  shift

and  R  or  if  youre  using  Mac  it  would  be

command  shift  and  R  and  there  we  go  now

were  finished  you  could  take  this

design  export  it  and  upload  it  to  a  site

like  Teespring  or  spreadshirt  or

wherever  else  and  have  your  shirt

printed  so  I  think  that  should  do  it  for
