taking  a  peek  into  the  world  of  graphic

design  for  the  first  time  can  be  a  bit

overwhelming

theres  a  lot  to  learn  in  terms  of

design  principles  color  theory

techniques  and  branding  in  general  but

if  you  want  to  create  digital  art  then

you  first  have  to  familiarize  yourself

with  the  tools  that  we  use  as  graphic

designers

as  of  right  now  the  industry  standard  is

the  adobe  creative  suite  with

applications  like  photoshop  and

illustrator  leading  the  way

these  programs  cost  a  lot  of  money

though  and  they  come  with  some  pretty

daunting  hardware  requirements

this  can  be  a  bit  off-putting  for

someone  who  just  has  a  casual  passing

interest  in  graphic  design

and  because  of  this  you  may  find

yourself  looking  into  free  alternatives

like  inkscape  and

and  wondering  what  the  differences  are

in  this  video  ill  be  comparing  both

applications  going  over  what  their

intended  uses  are

the  pros  and  cons  of  each  and  most

importantly  ill  be  helping  you

determine  which  one  is  best  for  you

this  is  nick  with  logosbynic.com  and  in

this  video  well  be  doing  a

comprehensive  comparison

of  both  inkscape  and  the  first

thing  you  need  to  understand  about

inkscape  and  is  that

although  theyre  both  free  and  open

source  design  applications

theyre  actually  quite  different

comparing  inkscape  versus  is  no  way

an  apples  to  apples  comparison

theyre  two  very  different  tools  with

very  different  intentions

lets  have  a  closer  look

despite  the  various  different  types  of

graphic  formats  that  exist  in  the  world

the  types  well  be  looking  at  in  this

video  are  raster  and  vector  and  its

important  to  understand  the  differences

between  these  two  because  they  both

represent  the  intended  uses

for  inkscape  and  rasterization  is  a

digital  imagery  format  where  the  image

is  made  of  individual  colored  boxes

known  as  pixels

and  its  the  format  that  youre  probably

most  familiar  with  this  is  commonly  used

in  things  like  photos

jpegs  and  other  types  of  imagery  you

commonly  see  on  the  web

the  raster  format  is  preferred  if  youre

going  to  do  any  kind  of  design  work

where  youll  be  editing  photographs  but

its  not  ideal  for  things  like

illustrations  and

designs  where  you  need  clean  lines  and

crisp  edges

vector  graphics  on  the  other  hand  are  a

different  type  of  imagery  format

altogether

vector  graphics  are  not  made  of  pixels

theyre  a  series  of  coordinate  points

that  dictate  the  properties  of  a  graphic

on  an  x  and  y

axis  this  makes  vector  graphics  ideal

for  things  like  illustrations

and  designs  where  you  need  to  have  crisp

definitive  edges

but  its  not  the  ideal  format  for

working  with  photos  where  inkscape  and

come  into  play  is  that  is

intended  for  working  with  raster  imagery

making  it  ideal  for  editing  photos  and

inkscape

is  a  vector  graphics  editor  making  it

ideal  for  creating  digital  illustrations

lets  take  a  more  in-depth  look  at  this

is  a  free  and  open  source

application  that  functions  in  the  raster

environment

and  its  widely  recognized  as  the  go-to

free  alternative  for  adobe  photoshop

which  stands  for  general  image

manipulation  program

was  originally  founded  in  1995  by

developers  spencer  kimball  and  peter

mattis  who  were  both  students  at  uc

berkeley  at  the  time

according  to  wikipedia  it  was  a

semester-long  project  they  were  working

on  for  the  experimental  computing

facility

as  the  years  went  by  continued  to

evolve  as  it  saw  lots  of

updates  and  new  features  from  a  bustling

community  of  users  and  supporters

believe  it  or  not  was  actually  used

to  create  the  original  google  logo  in

1998

so  keep  that  in  mind  for  the  next  time

that  somebody  wants  to  tell  you  that

professional  work  cant  be  done  with

open  source  software

would  be  the  ideal  program  for  you

if  youre  a  photographer  looking  to

retouch  your  photos

it  allows  you  to  adjust  things  like  the

white  balance  the  exposure

color  saturation  and  it  allows  for  some

complex  color  correction  using  curves

and  levels  as  well

it  even  has  some  cool  features  that

allow  you  to  do  things  like  alter  the

shadows  and  highlights  of  a  photograph

as  well  as  the  brightness  and  contrast

would  also  be  ideal  if  youre  just

looking  to  crop  an  image  or  maybe  crop

something  from  an  image  and  remove

the  background  theres  some  really

advanced  tools  and  features  that  allow

you  to  extract  subjects  from  your  photos

even  if  they  have  strands  of  hair  and

other  fine  details  that  make  it

difficult  to  define

you  can  also  use  to  make  some  quick

and  easy  corrections  to  subtle

imperfections  like

skin  blemishes  and  yellow  teeth  you  can

change  the  color  of  someones  eyes

create  different  color  variations  for  a

product  that  you  may  be  selling

and  you  can  even  restore  color  to  black

and  white  photos  and  by  the  way  i  have

lessons  demonstrating  how  to  do  all  of

these  things  on  my  channel

if  you  want  to  check  that  out  isnt

just  used  for  editing  photos  though

you  can  also  use  it  to  create  some

pretty  cool  effects  to  interact  with

your  photos  like

a  sliced  effect  mosaic  collages  3d

text  and  you  could  even  turn  yourself

into  a  caricature  if  youd  like

finally  is  the  right  tool  for  you

if  you  do  a  lot  of  sketching

painting  or  airbrushing  it  comes

equipped  with  lots  of

brushes  and  presets  attended  for

freehand  drawing  whether  it  be  by  mouse

or  with  a  drawing  tablet

you  can  even  download  brushes  that  were

intended  for  photoshop  and  use  them  in


and  if  you  cant  find  the  brush  youre

looking  for  you  can  simply  create  a

custom  brush  of  your  own

although  is  a  great  tool  its  not

the  right  tool  for  everything

a  good  example  of  this  would  be  for

designing  things  like  logos

symbols  and  other  types  of  simple  iconic

illustrations

these  things  have  lots  of  individual

moving  parts  that  you  need  to  regularly

move  around  and  transform

independent  of  the  rest  of  the  image  and

the  way  that  functions  just

isnt  suitable  for  this  sort  of  thing  it

can  technically  be  done

but  its  kind  of  like  using  a  fork  to

eat  your  cereal  youre  making  life  a

little  more  difficult  for  yourself  than

it  needs  to  be  because

theres  better  tools  that  you  can  use

another  problem  with  using  is  that

by  nature

the  designs  you  create  will  not  be

scalable  you  can  scale

down  without  a  problem  but  if  you  try  to

enlarge  your  image  youre  going  to  end

up  with  pixelation

or  in  other  words  the  individual  colored

boxes  that  make  up  the  image

are  going  to  become  more  visible  this

reduces  the  quality  and  resolution  of

the  image

if  you  want  a  more  dynamic  graphic  that

can  be  scaled  to  fit

many  different  sizes  and  applications

then  its  best  to  stick  with  vectors

lets  talk  a  little  bit  about  inkscape

now  unlike

inkscape  doesnt  work  with  pixels  its  a

vector  graphics  editor  and  its  widely

recognized  as  the  best  free  alternative

to  adobe  illustrator

inkscape  started  out  as  a  code  fork  for

sodipode  an  open  source  vector  graphics

editor  that  was  discontinued  in  2004.

the  project  was  led  by  developers  ted

gould  bryce  harrington

nathan  hearst  and  another  developer  who

goes  by  the  name  mental  guy

inkscape  has  come  a  long  way  since  then

theyve  added  lots  of  useful  features

like

live  path  effects  text  manipulation  and

various  third-party  extensions

the  core  functionality  of  inkscape

remains  the  same  though  so  you  never

quite  feel  like  you  have  to  relearn

anything

despite  all  of  the  additions  and

improvements

inkscape  would  be  the  best  tool  to  use

for  designing  logos

logo  design  is  unique  from  other  types

of  design  because  logos  are  typically

used  in  a  wider  variety  of  contexts

a  logo  needs  to  be  scaled  up  large

enough  to  work  as  a  sign

and  resize  to  fit  various  different

dimensions

one  of  the  benefits  of  working  with

vector  graphics  is  that  they  can  be

scaled  up

infinitely  without  quality  loss  this

means  that  you  can  take  your  logo  and

enlarge  it  for  use  on  a  billboard  or  the

side  of  a  van

without  having  to  worry  about  pixelation

the  vector  format  is  the  best

platform  for  providing  a  logo  with  the

versatility  that  it  needs

inkscape  is  also  useful  when  it  comes  to

creating  simple  illustrations  like  icons

buttons  and  user  interface  inkscape

makes  it  easy  to  work  with  simple  shapes

and  objects  that  can  be  combined  and

transformed  into  whatever  you  like

you  can  also  adjust  the  coordinate

points  of  an  object  otherwise  known  as

nodes

to  create  your  custom  shapes  another

thing  inkscape  is  great  for  is  creating

digital  illustrations

mascots  and  characters  with  a

cartoon-like  style

this  can  technically  be  done  with

as  well  but  the  vector  format  allows  you

to  give  your  illustrations  clean

crisp  and  definitive  lines  making

inkscape  the  ideal  tool  for  this

and  if  youre  creating  characters  for  a

2d  game  design  then  youre  going  to  need

the  scalable  benefit

of  working  with  vectors  as  well  inkscape

would  also  be  the  best  tool  for

designing  graphics  for  mobile

applications  like

app  icons  splash  screens  buttons  and

various  other  types  of  user  interface

the  vector  format  is  great  for  this

because  it  provides  the  versatility

needed  for  these  designs  to  fit

any  screen  resolution  without  quality

loss

finally  the  illustrative  nature  of

inkscape  allows  you  to  create  some  other

unique  types  of  designs  like

infographics  charts  and  repeatable

background  tiles  with  an  abstract

pattern

one  of  the  downsides  of  inkscape  is  that

you  can  only  work  with  photos  in  a  very

limited  capacity

since  inkscape  is  intended  for  creating

vector  designs

theres  really  not  much  you  can  do  with

rasterized  photographs

you  can  create  clipping  paths  to  remove

the  background  or

even  use  them  as  a  texture  mask  if  you

like  but  thats  about  it

if  youre  looking  to  do  any  kind  of

extensive  photo  editing

youre  better  off  sticking  with

another  downside  to  using  inkscape  is

that  its  not  ideal  for  doing  any  kind

of  painting  or  sketching

there  are  tools  that  allow  you  to  paint

and  sketch  in  inkscape  but  they  should

only  be  used  in  a  limited  capacity

the  way  that  vector  graphics  works  is

that  youll  put  a  lot  of  strain  on  your

hardware

if  you  create  too  many  brush  strokes  and

the  file  size  will  be  enormous

not  only  that  but  you  wont  get  all  of

the  brush  settings  and  realistic

textures  that  you  get

with  something  like

the  application  that  you  should  use  when

choosing  between  inkscape  and

depends  entirely  on  the  type  of  design

work  youre  doing

if  youre  working  with  a  lot  of  photos

you  should  probably  stick  to

but  if  youre  creating  simple

illustrations  then  youre  better  off

with  inkscape

one  software  is  not  objectively  better

than  the  other  it  depends  entirely  on

the  context  of  what  youre  designing

if  youre  wondering  if  its  more

important  to  learn  one  over  the  other

its  not  theyre  both  equally  important

as  a  graphic  designer  you  should

familiarize  yourself  with  both

vector  and  raster  design  knowing  how  to

work  with  both  allows  you  to  create  some

really  dynamic  designs  combining

elements  from  both  inkscape

and  and  itll  make  you  a  more

complete  designer  as  well

if  youd  like  to  learn  more  about

inkscape  and  i  have  hundreds  of

tutorials  on  this  channel  that  will  walk

you  through  each  step  in  such  a  way  that

even  a  first-time  user  could  follow

along

i  also  have  video  courses  for  each

application  where  i  go  through  every

tool  and  feature  and  explain  how  it  all

works

and  that  should  do  it  for  todays  video

if  you  have  any  questions  for  which

software  you  should  use  for  a  particular

type  of  design  that  i  may  not  have

covered  in  this  video
