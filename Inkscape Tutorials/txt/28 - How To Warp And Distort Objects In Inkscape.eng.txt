in  this  tutorial  well  be  going  over

some  of  the  ways  in  which  you  can  warp

and  distort  objects  in  inkscape  by  using

various  path  effects  so  to  get  started

well  have  a  look  at  the  envelope

deformation  path  effect  I  have  this  text

object  on  my  screen  here  Im  going  to

convert  this  from  text  to  a  path  by

selecting  it  and  going  to  path  and

selecting  object  to  path  and  now  Ill

open  up  my  path  effects  menu  by  going  to

path  and  selecting  path

effects  from  the  menu  Im  going  to  click

this  plus  icon  down  here  to  add  a  new

path  effect

and  the  path  effect  Im  looking  for  is

envelope  deformation  so  Im  going  to

select

that  and  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  so  I  can

see  it  better  and  if  you  notice  in  the

menu  over  here  we  have  four  different

ways  in  which  we  can  distort  this  object

top  bottom  left  and  right  so  if  I  click

this  button  right  here  bend  the  top  path

were  going  to  get  this  green  line  on

the  canvas  you  could  take  that  green

line  and  move  that  up  like  that  so  you

end  up  with  that  effect  right  there  and

you  can  click  on  each  node  and  change

these  handles  so  that  you  get  this  warp

effect  as  you  can  see  here  and  Ill  do

the  same  thing  down  here  with  the  bottom

path  Ill  change  that  as

well  and  if  you  want  to  change  the  right

and  left  path  you  could  just  click  the

buttons  for  those  as  well  you  can  bring

this  in  or  you  could  bring  it  out  like

that  and  Ill  do  the  same  thing  over

here  for  the  left  path  like  this  Ill

bring  this  one

in  and  then  we  end  up  with  that  effect

right  there  and  then  we  have  these  other

options  over  here  that  we  can  enable  as

well  so  if  I  toggle  off  the  left  and

right  paths  we  end  up  with  this  effect

right  right  there  and  since  this  is  a

path  effect  this  is  temporary  and  can  be

undone  at  any  time  by  just  toggling  off

the  visibility  of  the  path  effect  right

there  or  you  can  remove  it  by  pressing

the  minus  button  right  there  so  Ill

turn  that  back  on  if  you  want  to

finalize  the  effect  just  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  now  you  can  grab  your

nodes  tool  and  you  can  see  that  this  is

finalized  and  the  path  has  been  warped

so  another  way  in  which  you  can  warp

objects  and  inkscape  is  by  using  the

bend  path  effect  which  allows  you  to

bend  an  object  along  a  linear  path  so  a

good  example  for  this  here  I  have  this

drawing  of  a  lion  and  lets  say  I  wanted

to  add  a  tail  to  this  Lon  I  created  this

simple  little  tail  using  an  intersecting

area  between  two  circles  and  a  triangle

and  I  unified  it  all  together  so  Im

going  to  place  the  tail  on  the  lion  here

and  to  make  this  look  curved  so  it  looks

more  natural  Im  going  to  go  to  the  path

effects  menu  and  Im  going  to  add  a  new

path

effect  and  the  path  effect  Im  looking

for  this  time  is  Bend  so  Im  actually

going  to  type  it  up  here  so  I  could  find

it  Bend  there  we  go

and  now  if  you  click  this  button  over

here  where  it  says  Bend  path  you  have

this  green  line  that  you  can  edit  so  I

could  take  this  and  pull  this  down  like

that  and  as  you  can  see  there  the  path

is  being  or  the  object  rather  is  being

bent  along  that  Green  Path  and  you  could

adjust  these  handles  and  you  could  take

this  handle  over  here  if  you  need  to

make  this  wider  like

that  just  like  that  and  there  we  go  we

have  now  we  have  a  bent  path  that  looks

more  natural  like  a  lions  tail  and  the

final  path  effect  well  be  having  a  look

at  is  the  lattice  deformation  which

gives  you  multiple  points  in  which  you

can  warp  an  object  so  if  I  select  my

subject  here  and  I  add  a  path  effect  Im

going  to  look  for  lattice

deformation  there  we  go  and  once  you

have  that  applied  you  can  come  over  here

to  your  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool  and  you

can  see  we  have  this  blue  grid  with

nodes  placed  on  it  and  you  could  take

these  nodes  and  move  them  around  like

this  to  distort  the  object  so  if  I  go

like  that  I  can  make  the  subject  taller

or  shorter  and  can  warp  and  distort  it

in  various  ways  so  that  it  doesnt  look

so  so  much  like  the  original  object

there  like  that  and  if  I  select  my

selection  tool  and  toggle  this  off  you

could  see  the  difference  there  we  were

able  to  warp  this  object  rather  easily

using  that  path  effect  so  thats  just  a

few  of  the  ways  in  which  you  can  warp

and  distort  objects  in  inkscape  if  you

found  this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

$17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for  watching
