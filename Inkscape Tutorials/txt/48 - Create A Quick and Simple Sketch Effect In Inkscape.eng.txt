this  is  nick  with  logosbynick.com  and  in

this  tutorial  ill  be  demonstrating  how

you  can  take  a  vector  object  and  apply

this  very  quick  and  simple  sketch  effect

to  it  using  the  hatches  path  effect  in

inkscape

so  to  get  us  started  here  im  going  to

apply  this  effect  to  a  really  simple

shape  first  so  let  me  get  this  out  of

the  way  im  going  to  grab  the  circles

and  ellipses  tool  and  im  going  to  click

and  drag  on  the  canvas  to  create  a

circle  like  that  ill  hold  ctrl  to  make

this  perfectly  round

so  im  going  to  apply  the  sketch  effect

to  this  shape  and  then  well  go  ahead

and  apply  it  to  some  text

so  the  first  thing  we  want  to  do  is  open

up  the  path  effects  menu  so  im  going  to

come  up  here  to  where  it  says  path  and

im  going to  click  on  path  effects

and  youre  going  to  get  this  little  menu

over  here  in  the  right  hand  side  of  the

screen  and  what  were  looking  for  down

here  is  where  this  little  plus  icon  is

you  click  on  that  to  add  a  new  path

effect  and  youre  going  to  see  you  have

this  whole  list  of  different  path

effects  to  choose  from  the  one  that  we

are  looking  for  is  right  here  its

called  hatches  if  youre  having

difficulty  locating  it  you  can  come  up

here  to  the  search  bar  and  just  type  in

hatches  and  there  you  go  there  it  is

okay  so  once  we  apply  that  as  you  can

see  it  took  the  object  and  filled  it

with  these  lines  otherwise  known  as

hatches  and  what  you  can  do  now  is  grab

the  edit  paths  by  nodes  tool  and  if  you

notice  let  me  zoom  in  on  this  a  little

bit

if  you  notice  we  have  these  green  nodes

right  here  we  have  this  one  green  node

and  then  we  have  this  green  node  and

then  down  here  we  have  this  yellow  node

and  then  we  have  this  yellow  node  so  let

me  show  you  how  this  works  this  first

green  node  right  here  if  you  click  and

drag  it  it  allows  you  to  change  the

position  of  the  hatches  on  the  object

this  green  node  over  here  allows  you  to

change  the  density  and  the  direction  of

the  hatches  so  if  i  bring  the  green  node

closer  to  the  other  green  node  it  makes

the  hatches  more  dense  like  that  so  it

fills  in  more  of  the  shape  and  then  if

you  rotate  it  around  like  that  you  can

change  the  direction  of  it

so  let  me  place  this  right  about  here

over  here  we  have  um

this  these  yellow  handles  right  here

represent  the  bend  so  you  what  you  can

do  is  take  this  one  handle  and  give  this

object  a  bend  like  that  by  clicking  and

dragging  it  out  like  that  and  this  other

yellow  handle  represents  the  start  point

of  that  bend  so  if  you  were  to  take  this

over  here  notice  the  two  handles  are

moving  together  if  i  put  this  one  over

here  this  will  be  the  start  point  and

then  over  here  this  will  be  the  end

point  and  i  can  move  this  all  the way

out  like  that  and  you  can  as  you  can  see

we  are  creating  quite  an  intense  bend

there  so  let  me  put  that  back  towards

the  original  one  because  i  dont  want

this  to  have  much  of  a  bend  at  all  ill

put  this  back  in  the  center  of  the

object  and  let  me  zoom  out  a  little  bit

im  going  to  grab  the  select  tool  now

lets  say  we  want  to  make  these  hatches

thicker  or  larger  what  you  can  do  is

just  scale  down  the  object  using  the

select  tool  im  going  to  hold  ctrl  so

that  it  scales  proportionately  scale  it

down  like  that  and  as  you  can  see  it

makes  the  hatches  bigger  if  you  scale  it

down  if  you  scale  it  up  it  makes  them

thinner  so  let  me  scale  this  down  a

little  bit  so  i  get  a  nice  a  nice  size

hatch  that  i  like  right  there  that  looks

pretty  good  and  after  you  do  that  you

may  want  to  edit  the  um  you  may  want  to

go  back  to  the  nodes  tool  and  edit  the

the  density  of  those  hatches  as  you  can

see  here  make  them  a little  closer

together  like  that

and  once  youre  finished  applying  this

effect  you  can  finalize  it  by  going  to

path

object  to  path

and  now  that  is  a  vector  path  and  no

longer  a  path  effect

okay  so  that  is  how  you  can  create  that

simple  sketch  effect  for  like  a  regular

object  let  me  show  you  how  to  do  this

with  text  now

im  going  to  grab  the  text  tool

right  over  here  click  on  the  canvas  and

im  going  to  write

sketch

and  im  going  to  change  the  font  of  that

im  going to  go  to  text  text  and  font

and  im  looking  for

im  going  to  use  a  heavy  font  for  this

im  going  to  use  chunk  5.  you  can  use

whatever  font  youd  like  but  id

recommend  using  a  really  bold

heavyweight  font  click  apply

let  me  grab  the  select  tool  and  scale

this  up

hold  ctrl  so  it  locks  the  proportions

like  that

now  the  thing  with  these  path  effects

with  this  sketch  or  this  this  uh  hatchs

path  effect  it  only  works  on  pads  it

wont  work  on  objects  that  arent  pads

this  right  here  is  a  text  object  so  that

the  hatchs  path  effect  wont  work  on

this  unless  we  convert  it  to  a  path

so  in  order  to  change  this  from  a  text

object  to  a  path  we  just  select  it  and

go  to  path

object  to  path

and  now  i  can  come  back  up  here  to  my

path  effects  menu  add  that  path  effect

again  there  it  is  hatches

and  if  you  notice  here  theres  not  much

visibility  there  because  theres  not

much  density  between  those  hatches  so

let  me  zoom  in

let  me  grab  the  edit  pads  by  nodes  tool

and  im  going  to  take  this  green  handle

and  bring  it  towards  the  original  like

that  and  as  you  can  see  we  are  getting

the  sketch  effect  as  we  intended

there  we  go  that  looks  pretty  good  right

there  now  im  going to  zoom  out

and  to  finalize  this  i  will  go  back  to

the  select  tool  ill  go  to  path

object  to  path  and  there  you  go  now  we

have  our  simple  sketch  effect  that  we

have  created  using  inkscape

if  you  found  this  lesson  useful  be  sure

to  check  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  i  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  just  like  i  did  in

this  video  and  i  explain  what  they  are

and  demonstrate  how  they  work  we  even

have  a  private  community  where  you  can

answer  ask  questions  and  get  help  from

me  anytime  you  want  ill  have  a  link  in

the  description  of  the  video  if  you  want

to  check  that  out  as  always  thanks  for
