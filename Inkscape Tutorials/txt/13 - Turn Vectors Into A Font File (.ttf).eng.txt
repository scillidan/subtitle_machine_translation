in  a  previous  tutorial  I  demonstrated

how  you  can  use  inkscape  to  create  your

own  Vector  letters  but  in  this  tutorial

Ill  be  demonstrating  how  you  can  take

those  letters  and  turn  them  into  a

proper  font  file  in  ttf  format  so

getting  us  started  here  in  inscape  you

can  see  I  have  these  simple  letters  that

Ive  designed  if  I  grab  my  nodes  tool

and  zoom  in  on  this  you  can  see  how  I

created  these  these  are  just  individual

paths  that  I  apply  to  stroke  to  and  Im

going  to  use  these  letters  to  create  a

font  file  uh  for  this  demonstration  so

in  order  turn  these  letters  into  a  font

file  were  going  to  need  to  download  an

application  called  font  uh  font  Forge

its  a  free  and  open-  Source  font  editor

that  allows  you  to  create  your  own  fonts

as  well  so  go  ahead  and  download  a  font

Forge  from  the  link  in  the  description

launch  the  application  and  once  youve

launched  font  Forge  it  should  look

something  like  this  so  Im  going  to

click  on  this  button  right  here  titled

new  so  I  can  create  a  new  font  and  when

I  do  that  were  going  to  get  this  window

with  all  of  these  individual  boxes  in  it

and  these  boxes  all  represent  the

individual  characters  of  the  font  your

creating  so  if  you  notice  we  have  all  of

the  special  characters  here  we  have  the

numbers  we  have  the  uppercase  letters

the  lowercase  letters  and  some

additional  special  characters  down  here

for  this  demonstration  Im  just  going  to

fill  in  the  upper  and  lowercase  letters

Im  going  to  go  back  into  inkscape  and

to  do  this  all  we  have  to  do  is  copy  and

paste  each  letter  into  each  individual

each  individual  box  so  Im  going  to  take

the  letter  a  right  here  Ill  right  click

that  and  go  to  copy  Ill  come  back  over

here  into  font  Forge  and  Im  going  to

select  the  Box  corresponding  with  the

letter  a  and  Im  just  going  to  paste

that  in  there  either  by  right  clicking

it  and  going  to  paste  or  you  could  just

press  contrl  +v  on  the  keyboard  that

paste  that  in  there  now  if  you  notice  in

the  thumbnail  preview  there  the  letter

is  located  in  the  top  left  of  that

preview  box  there  so  were  going  to

adjust  that  by  double  clicking  on  the

letter  to  open

it  and  when  we  open  it  were  going  to

get  this  editor  here  sort  of  like

inkscape  it  allows  you  to  change  the

design  if  youd  like  to  it  also  allows

you  to  change  the  position  now  the  size

of  your  letter  may  vary  depending  on  the

size  of  the  letter  in  the  software  here

here  if  you  find  that  your  letter  is  too

big  or  too  small  you  can  resize  it

manually  using  the  interface  here  or

what  I  would  recommend  doing  is  going

back  into  inkscape  and  resizing  all  of

the  letters  at  the  same  time  so  that

each  letter  is  consistent  when  you

create  your  font  from  it  so  uh  if  you

size  these  down  one  by  one  youre  going

to  have  inconsistent  weights  between  the

letters  so  I  would  recommend  sizing  them

all  at  once  my  size  here  is  pretty  good

Im  going  to  leave  it  as  it  is  what  I  am

going  to  do  though  is  Im  going  to

change  the  position  of  this  letter  if

you  notice  down  here  this  represents  the

Baseline  of  the  text  and  this  area  down

here  represents  the  area  that  goes

beneath  the  Baseline  so  for  example  if

you  were  creating  a  lowercase  G  you

would  want  part  of  the  letter  to  rest  on

the  Baseline  but  youd  want  that  tail  to

dip  down  under  there  so  to  move  this  Im

just  going  to  click  and  drag  over  the

letter  here  and  Im  going  to  click  and

drag  one  of  these  nodes  and  Im  going  to

hold  the  shift  key  and  bring  this  down

until  the  node  snaps  onto  the  Baseline

and  now  you  can  see  we  have  all  of  this

extra  space  in  here  Im  going  to  close

that  by  taking  this  guide  right  here  and

just  bringing  this  in  further  and  I  want

to  leave  a  little  bit  of  space  there

because  this  is  going  to  repres  repr  the

spacing  between  each  letter  so  if  I  were

to  bring  this  all  the  way  in  there  would

be  no  spacing  between  the  letter  a  and

the  next  letter  I  type  I  want  there  to

be  some  spacing  though  so  Ill  put  about

that  much  spacing  in  there  and  that

looks  pretty  good  I  can  close  out  of

that  and  now  you  can  see  the  letter  a  is

all  set  so  Ill  repeat  this  process  now

with  the  letter  B  Ill  just  copy  it  by

pressing  contrl  C  come  back  in  here  come

back  in  here  press  contrl  V  to  paste  it

double  click  the  layer  select  the  letter

and  grab  the  node  and  just  snap  this  to

the  bottom  again  holding  shift  to  lock

it  onto  the  vertical  axis  there  we  go

now  it  snaps  I  can  take  this  line  and

move  this

in  and  close  out  of  that  and  there  we  go

so  what  Im  going  to  do  is  Ill  go

through  here  and  copy  and  paste  all  of

these  letters  in  here  real  quick  and

Ill  catch  up  with  you  when  Im

done  so  one  minor  thing  I  wanted  to

point  out  in  regards  to  letters  like  a

lowercase  G  where  the  tail  descends  down

beneath  the  Baseline  to  move  this  letter

we  want  to  place  the  Baseline  we  want  to

place  this  part  of  the  letter  right  here

on  the  Baseline  and  we  want  this  part  of

the  letter  to  descend  send  beyond  the

Baseline  so  Im  going  to  select

everything  and  instead  of  clicking  and

dragging  the  bottom  node  Im  going  to

take  this  node  right  here  which  is  the

node  that  Id  like  to  be  on  the  Baseline

and  Ill  drag  it  according  to  that  one

again  Ill  hold  shift  and  then  snap  that

node  onto  the  Baseline  and  as  you  can

see  there  the  letter  G  now  descends

beneath  the  Baseline  as  intended  and  I

can  move  this  line  back  in  and  were

good  to

go  and  for  this  particular  font  that  Im

creating  I  dont  have  upper  and

lowercase  variations  of  these  letters  I

just  have  the  lowercase  varieties  so  Im

just  going  to  copy  and  paste  the

uppercase  variety  into  the  lowercase

boxes  uh  so  that  theyre  all  the

same  and  once  youre  finished  generating

all  of  the  characters  for  your  font  you

can  give  your  font  a  name  by  coming  up

here  to  the  element  menu  and  choosing

font  info  now  this  parts  important

because  whatever  you  enter  here  is  going

to  be  the  name  of  your  font  so  if  you

dont  want  your  font  to  be  named

Untitled  one  just  go  ahead  and  change

that  to  something  else  Im  just  going  to

name  this  after  myself  Ill  name  it  Nick

and  uh  if  if  you  want  you  could  fill  in

this  other  metadata  down  here  we  have

all  of  this  other  stuff  that  you  can

look  through  if  youd  like  Im  just

going  to  leave  these  defaults  as  they

are  for  this  lesson  and  Ill  click

okay  and  now  to  generate  a  font  file  Im

going  to  come  up  here  to  where  it  says

file  and  Im  going  to  select  uh  generate

fonts  and  from  this  menu  you  can  choose

where  you  would  like  to  save  your  font

file  to  you  can  use  this  dropdown  to

choose  the  font  file  type  Im  just  going

to  leave  the  default  which  is  ttf  and  my

font  file  is  going  to  be  called  nick.

ttf  and  Im  just  going  to  click  generate

now  when  I  click  generate  Im  going  to

get  these  error  messages  because  I

didnt  create  a  proper  font  file  theres

a  lot  of  errors  with  what  I  created  here

Im  just  going  to  skip  past  this  Im

going  to  click

generate  and  if  you  open  up  your  files

Im  going  to  open  this  right  here  you

can  see  nick.  ttf  there  is  my  font  and

there  is  the  preview  of  the  font  that  I

created  and  Ill  go  ahead  and  install

this  and  now  this  font  can  be  used

virtually  anywhere  in  your  operating

system  not  just  with  inkscape  with  any

design  app  that  you  want  any  word

processor  in  fact  Ill  reload  inkscape

here  just  to  show  you  what  I  mean  let  me

close  out  of  this  and  relaunch  the

software  let  me  shrink  that

down  and  Ill  just  write  in  some

placeholder  text  Ill  press  contr  a  to

select  it  all  and  Im  going  to  go

looking  for  my  font  here  in  this  list  so

Im  looking  for

Nick  there  it  is  Ill  click  apply  and

there  is  the  font  that  Ive  created  and

in  fact  I  can  go  and  change  this  now  you

know  what  let  me  try  that

again

and  if  I  bring  out  let  me  let  me  open

the  rulers  by  pressing  controlr  and  Ill

bring  down  a  horizontal  guide  if  I  place

this  horizontal  guide  here  you  could  see

what  I  was  talking  about  earlier  with

the  uh  the  Baseline  of  the  text  the

Baseline  sits  the  letters  all  sit  on  the

proper  Baseline  and  the  letter  G  and  the

letter  Y  descend  beneath  it  the  same

with  the  letter  P  as  well  so  that  is  how

you  can  go  about  creating  your  own  font

files  using  Vector  elements  if  you  found

this  lesson  useful  then  consider

checking  out  my  inkscape  master  class

its  a  collection  of  over  60  videos

where  I  go  over  all  of  the  tools  and

features  in  inkscape  and  I  explain  what

they  are  and  demonstrate  how  they  work

kind  of  like  how  I  did  in  this  video  we

even  have  a  private  Community  where  you

can  ask  questions  and  get  help  from  me

anytime  you  want  and  best  of  all  theres

no  monthly  membership  fees  you  just  pay

$17  one  time  and  youre  in  for  Life  Ill

have  some  information  about  that  down

below  if  you  want  to  check  that  out  as

always  thanks  for
