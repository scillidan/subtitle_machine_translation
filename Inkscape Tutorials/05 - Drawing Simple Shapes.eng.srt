1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,800
how you can create these six icon

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,359
designs using nothing but basic shapes

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,080
in inkscape before we get started though

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,240
if you want to learn more about how

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,080
inkscape Works be sure to check out my

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,280
inkscape master class it's a collection

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,239
of over 80 videos where we go over all

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,039
of the tools and features in inkscape

10
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,359
and I explain what they are and

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
demonstrate how they work we even have a

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,840
private Community where you can ask

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,560
questions and get help from me anytime

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,480
you

15
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,560
want so the first thing I'm going to

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,759
demonstrate is how to draw a heart so

17
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,759
let me grab the squares and rectangles

18
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,879
tool I'll click and drag on the canvas

19
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,760
to draw a vertically elongated rectangle

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,360
and then I'll grab my selection tool and

21
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,920
I want to make sure I have this lock

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,239
icon turned off up here in the toolbar

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,160
and for the width I want the width to be

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,559
100 pixels and I want the height to be

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,199
225

26
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,079
pixels and then I'm going to zoom in on

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,039
this object I'm going to go back to my

28
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,879
rectangle tool and I'm going to grab

29
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,480
this circular knot right here and bring

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,879
this all the way down so that we have

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,960
rounded edges like that

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
then I'll grab my selection tool I'll

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,760
right click the object and go to

34
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,000
duplicate I will rotate it

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,880
90° select both objects click on them to

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,520
get the rotation handles and then hold

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,360
your control key and grab the rotation

38
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,400
handle in the corner here and rotate it

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
around until it's upright like that

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,920
where it sort of looks like an X and now

41
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
you can go into your shape Builder tool

42
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,960
make sure you have the addition option

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,520
enabled and click and drag to draw a

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,119
line going through the area of the

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
shapes to draw a heart now you can go

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,479
back to your selection tool and just

47
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,479
like that you've drawn a

48
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,159
heart now let's go over how you can draw

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,159
this waving flag icon I'm going to grab

50
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,360
my rectangle tool I'll click and drag on

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,079
the canvas to draw a

52
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,920
rectangle and I want to make sure that I

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,520
have the edges rounded as I did for the

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,640
previous object that we

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,360
created and then I'm going to draw

56
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,200
another rectangle right about here and

57
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,680
bring it out about that far

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
and I want to get rid of the rounded

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,159
edges here so I'll come up here and

60
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,799
click on this button in the

61
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,479
toolbar I'll grab my selection tool move

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,400
this over about here and use this

63
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
scaling handle right here to size the

64
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,920
rectangle appropriately about where it

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,640
needs to be relative to the pole I'll

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,879
place this right about here we want a

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,519
little bit of space to be between the

68
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,200
pole and the

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,879
flag once that's done let's create an

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,920
object to place on top of the flag for

71
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,519
my example here I just used a star so I

72
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,280
will use that for this demonstration as

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
well but you can use whatever you'd like

74
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm going to grab my stars and polygons

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,440
tool I'm going to choose the star option

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
I want five corners and I want the spoke

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
ratio to be

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
0.375 and the rounded and randomized

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,519
both set to zero and then I can click

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,560
and drag on my canvas to draw a star

81
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I'll hold control and

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
shift and bring my cursor straight up

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
like

84
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,360
that and then I'll grab my selection

85
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,480
tool I'll place this in the center of

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,040
the

87
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,239
rectangle to scale it down I'm holding

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,480
control and shift and clicking and

89
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,959
dragging the

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
handle and to place this in the center

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
of the rectangle I'll hold shift and

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
click on the rectangle so that I have

93
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,720
both object selected and I will open up

94
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,760
my aligned distribute menu by going to

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,959
object and selecting aligned

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,920
distribute I want to make sure I have

97
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
last selected chosen from this dropdown

98
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
and I will Center it vertically and

99
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,400
horizontally

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
and then I will go to path and select

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,159
difference and it's going to subtract

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,319
the star from the rectangle so that it

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,799
creates a negative space area within it

104
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,239
now let me just place this over here to

105
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,159
readjust it I want to make these two

106
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,319
corners of the rectangle rounded so let

107
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,599
me come over here to my nodes tool I'll

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
click on this icon up here that says add

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,480
Corners live path effect and I'll click

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
on this node to select it and then hold

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
shift and click on this node to select

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
it with those two nodes selected you can

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
grab these white knots right here and

114
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,599
click and drag them to round the corners

115
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,560
of the selected nodes now I'm going to

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,879
bring that down a little more so it's

117
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,799
not too

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
rounded right about there looks good and

119
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
once you're done with that you can click

120
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
on this Square icon up here to convert

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,199
them to a path and that finalizes the

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
effect now I'm going to give the flag a

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,639
waving effect so to do that let me grab

124
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,759
my selection tool I'm going to open up

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,040
the path effects menu by going to path

126
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,039
and selecting path effects and from this

127
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,919
drop down over here I'm looking for

128
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,039
envelope deformation I'm going to select

129
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,520
that and I want to uncheck this box

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,000
right here that says enable left and

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,960
right paths and I'm going to select top

132
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,400
Bend path right here and I'm going to

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
grab this top Edge and click and drag it

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
up like that and then I'll click on this

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,919
note over here and I'll take this handle

136
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,520
and bring this down like that so we want

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
a little bit of a contour going on the

138
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,039
top edge of the flag don't worry about

139
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,320
what's happening on the left and right

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
and down here that's going to come

141
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,479
together once we finish making all of

142
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,160
these adjustments so I'm just going to

143
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,280
adjust this

144
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,000
accordingly and then I want to do the

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
same thing with the bottom Edge so I'll

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
come over here and select bottom path

147
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
and I'll do the same thing I'll take

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,320
this line and I'll bring this one up and

149
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,280
I'll bring this one down so that the

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Contours are consistent on the top and

151
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
the

152
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
bottom and that looks good right there

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
and once you're finish you can finalize

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,319
this by going to path and selecting

155
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,400
object to path and just like that you've

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,759
created a waving FL FL

157
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,039
icon now we'll go over how to create

158
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,400
this wi glass shape so I'm going to grab

159
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,319
my circles and ellipses tool and I'll

160
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,440
click and drag on the canvas to draw an

161
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,240
elongated ellipse like that and I'll

162
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
make this black and I'm going to open up

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,479
my fill-in stroke menu by double

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,360
clicking the color stripe down here next

165
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,120
to the fill label and I'll bring the

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,319
opacity of this down roughly in

167
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,720
half now I want to make a duplicate copy

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
of this so let me go to my selection

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
tool I'll right click this and go to

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,080
duplicate and I'll hold my shift key and

171
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,919
I'll grab this top Arrow up here and

172
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,039
click and drag to scale this in and as

173
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,720
long as you're holding shift it'll scale

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,800
inward from the top and bottom like that

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,479
and we want to make this about that

176
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,479
height right about

177
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,440
there and now I'm going to right click

178
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,840
this and go to duplicate I'll hold

179
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,080
control and bring this all the way down

180
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,360
here and I'll make this a little smaller

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
by holding control and taking this top

182
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,759
arrow and scaling that down a little

183
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
bit and then I'm going to convert this

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
to a path by going to path and selecting

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,360
object to path I'll grab the nodes tool

186
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
and I'll take this node right here and

187
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,400
click on it to select it and then hold

188
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,280
control and click and drag it up about

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
that far and the same thing with this

190
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,919
node I'll select this Noe and I'll click

191
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,880
and drag this up just a tiny bit though

192
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,720
not much maybe about that far and this

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,080
is going to be the base of the wine

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,599
glass so now I'm going to grab the

195
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
rectangle tool and I'm going to click

196
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,639
and drag to draw a rectangle going

197
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,440
between the two objects here to

198
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,039
represent the stem of the wine glass and

199
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,080
I will make these Corners sharp by

200
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
clicking on this

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,560
button and I'll scale this down a little

202
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
bit I'm going to hold my shift key and

203
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,479
use this handle right here to scale that

204
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,520
down and I want to make sure I have

205
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,680
everything here centered so let me zoom

206
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,080
out let me select everything let come

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
over here to my align and distribute

208
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,599
menu and make sure I have everything

209
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,879
centered on the vertical

210
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,160
axis and now I can come over here into

211
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,400
the shape Builder tool and I can draw a

212
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,280
line through these areas to draw the

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,319
shape shape that I'm trying to create

214
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,879
and if I go back to the selection tool

215
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,560
now all we have to do is round these

216
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,919
Corners in here so let me grab the nodes

217
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,039
tool and click on the object I'm going

218
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,639
to select these four nodes right

219
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,840
here I'll click on this button up here

220
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,680
to add

221
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,520
Corners let me select them

222
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
again and I'll take this handle and

223
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
bring this in or this white this little

224
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
round white knot and bring that in a

225
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
little bit just to give a little bit of

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
a rounded rounded transition between the

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
stem and the other parts of the glass

228
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,039
and now we can go back to the select

229
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
tool and zoom

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,039
out and now we can go to our fill and

231
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,080
stroke menu bring the opacity back up to

232
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,120
100% and there is our wine

233
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,440
glass next we'll go over how to create

234
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,560
this shopping cart icon so I'll come

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,440
back into inkscape I'm going to grab my

236
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,800
beier pen which is located over here in

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
the toolbar or you can access it by

238
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,639
pressing the letter B on your keyboard

239
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
and up here in the tool settings menu I

240
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,560
want to choose this option right here

241
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,479
that says create a sequence of straight

242
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,519
line segments and I want to click once

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,360
on the canvas to create a point and then

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
hold the control key and bring the line

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,039
straight across about that far and then

246
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,479
click again to create another point and

247
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,760
then I'm going to bring the line down

248
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
about this far but I'm going to hold the

249
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
control key so that it locks it onto a

250
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,080
75 degree angle and if you look in the

251
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
status bar at the bottom of the screen

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,399
it'll show you which angle you currently

253
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,040
have the line going at so if I move it

254
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
around you can see this angle changes I

255
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
want the angle to be 75 degrees so I'll

256
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,200
move it about that far

257
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,240
and again while I'm holding control

258
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,760
click to add a point and then bring this

259
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
line straight across about that far like

260
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,800
that and then press the enter key to

261
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,480
close the path now we'll come over here

262
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,880
to the stroke style tab under the fill

263
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,079
and stroke Tab and I want to hold up on

264
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,480
this plus icon to make this stroke

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
thicker or give it a heavier

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
weight and I want it to have rounded

267
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,959
caps as well so I'll click on this

268
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,320
rounded caps button and I want it to

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,079
have rounded Corners as well or rounded

270
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,000
joins so I'll select that option as well

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
and now I'm going to grabb the rectangle

272
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,200
tool let me press the Escape key to

273
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
deselect everything there and I'll click

274
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,399
and drag to draw a rectangle going over

275
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,160
the object like

276
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,600
this and I'll convert that to a path by

277
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
going to path and selecting object to

278
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,839
path and I'll grab the nodes tool and

279
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,320
I'll take this node and bring this down

280
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,720
and over like that we want the top Edge

281
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
and the right Edge going straight like a

282
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,440
90° angle and then down here this bottom

283
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,320
Edge dips down

284
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,720
and you can resize this as needed so I'm

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
going to resize this I'm going to scale

286
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
this down to make sure to hold the

287
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,959
control key while you scale it down to

288
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,120
preserve the aspect

289
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,920
ratio and I noticed that this part of

290
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
the cart down here sticks out a little

291
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,680
too far so I'll grab my nodes tool and

292
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,959
I'll just bring that node in a little

293
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,160
bit and I'll hold control while I'm

294
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,560
doing that so it locks it onto the

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,440
horizontal

296
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
axis now I'll select the basket of the

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,519
cart and I'm going to apply the corner

298
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,680
is life path effect as

299
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
well select each of these nodes by

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
clicking on both of them or holding

301
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,279
shift and clicking on both of them and

302
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,720
then grab the white knot and bring that

303
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,200
in like that just to give them rounded

304
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,040
Corners like

305
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,320
that now I'm going to add some Wheels to

306
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
the cart so let me grab the circles and

307
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
ellipses tool I'll click and drag I'll

308
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
hold the control key and click and drag

309
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
to draw a perfectly round circle like

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,720
that grab the selection tool place it

311
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,320
right under the cart duplicate it by

312
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,160
right clicking it and going to duplicate

313
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,639
and then hold your control key and click

314
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,600
and drag this straight across like that

315
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,480
and now what I'll do is for one final

316
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,959
step I'll click on this part of the cart

317
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,320
go back to the nodes tool add the corner

318
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,160
live path effect and then click on this

319
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,040
node right here and just make this

320
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
rounded using that

321
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,040
knot there we go once you're finished

322
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,760
you can click the square icon to convert

323
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,200
this to a path and then you're going to

324
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
want to convert the stroke to a path as

325
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
well so we'll go to path and select

326
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,600
stroke to

327
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,079
path and we can select everything now

328
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,000
and go to path Union and now we have a

329
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,079
shopping cart

330
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,399
icon now let's go over how to create

331
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,000
this sword

332
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,200
icon I'm going to grab the circles and

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,399
ellipses tool and I'll hold my control

334
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,040
key and click and drag to draw a

335
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,760
perfectly round circle I'll grab my

336
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,079
selection tool move it towards the

337
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,320
bottom of the page click off of the

338
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
graphic to deselect it and then I'll

339
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
grab my rectangle tool and I'll click

340
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,800
and drag a rectangle going through the

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,399
circle about that

342
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
wide and then I want to grab my

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
selection tool select both of these go

344
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,360
to the aligned distribute menu and

345
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Center them up vertically click off of

346
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,959
it to deselect everything and I want to

347
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,920
select just the rectangle here and hold

348
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,079
my shift key and use this right arrow to

349
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,000
scale this down or up a little bit

350
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
depending on how big or small your

351
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,240
rectangle is uh the idea is we want I'm

352
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,800
paying attention to down here where this

353
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,880
circle meets I want some of the circles

354
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,519
sticking out between that from that

355
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,480
rectangle there if I make it too big

356
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
it's not quite obvious that there's a

357
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,680
circle there but if I make it smaller it

358
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,639
looks a little out of place or too big

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
so I want to find a happy medium which I

360
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
think is right about

361
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,800
there and then once that's done I will

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,680
bring this up a little more and I'm

363
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,279
going to convert this to a path by going

364
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,839
to path and selecting object to path and

365
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,320
then I'll grab my nodes tool and I want

366
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
to select these two nodes up top over

367
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,639
here and I want to enable this setting

368
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,320
up here in the tool settings menu that

369
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,639
says show transformation hand so I'll

370
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,680
click on that to enable it and then I

371
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
want to hold control and shift and grab

372
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
this Arrow right here and scale this out

373
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
like that so that we make this we make

374
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
the top of this wider than the

375
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,279
bottom now we can disable that setting

376
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
with these two nodes still selected we

377
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,160
can come up here and select this button

378
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
that says insert new nodes into selected

379
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
segments and then click on just that new

380
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,639
node right there and then hold your

381
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,279
control key and click and drag it up

382
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,639
like that to create the point of the

383
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,079
sword so I'll bring it up a about that

384
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,399
far and now we'll create the handle of

385
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,639
the sword so I'll go back to my

386
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
rectangle tool I'll click and drag to

387
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,160
draw rectangle about that

388
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,040
size let me grab my selection tool and

389
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,360
reposition

390
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,600
this I want to make sure everything here

391
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,399
is centered so I'll select everything

392
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,800
Center it up

393
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,279
vertically and select just this object

394
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,560
right here and I'm going to convert this

395
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,279
to a path I'll go to path object to path

396
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
I'll go to my nodes tool and select

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
these two nodes no I'm sorry I'll add

398
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,320
the cornner live path effect first and

399
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,240
then I will select these two nodes and

400
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
bring this hand bring these Handles in

401
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,040
like this so that we have rounded

402
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,480
edges then we can convert that to a path

403
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,920
by clicking the square

404
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
icon and now I want to create a little

405
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
bit of separation between the handle and

406
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,120
the sword or the blade of the sword kind

407
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,480
of like how I did over here you can see

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
that separation there so to do that

409
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,560
let me just take this object right click

410
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,560
it go to duplicate make it white and

411
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
bring this up like that just click and

412
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
drag this handle up and then click this

413
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
button that says lower selection one

414
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,759
step to lower it beneath the black

415
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,160
object and you can just take this handle

416
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,120
and make this in as big or as small as

417
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,680
you'd like it to be it may help to zoom

418
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,199
out and see exactly how it looks in

419
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,560
comparison to the rest of the objects

420
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,040
and once you're happy with the size just

421
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,759
hold shift and click on the blade and go

422
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,600
to path difference

423
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
then you could select everything and go

424
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,440
to path

425
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,959
Union and now you have created a sword

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
icon and for the final part of this

427
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,839
tutorial I will demonstrate how to

428
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,639
create this book

429
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,880
icon so to do this I'm going to grab my

430
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
stars and polygons tool I want to come

431
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
up here to the toolbar and choose the

432
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
polygon setting I want six corners and

433
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
rounded and randomize both set to zero

434
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
and then I'm going to hold control and

435
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,079
shift on my keyboard and click and drag

436
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,319
up in an upward motion with my cursor so

437
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,560
that I create a hexagon where the

438
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,480
corners are going up and down vertically

439
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,399
like that let me grab my selection tool

440
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,720
and put this towards the center of the

441
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,560
page now I'm going to convert this to a

442
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,319
path by going to path and selecting

443
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,639
object to path and I'll go to my nodes

444
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,399
tool and I want to select these nodes

445
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,880
down here these three nodes down here in

446
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,759
the bottom hold your control key and

447
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,079
click and drag them up about that

448
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,839
far now I'm going to grab my selection

449
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,040
tool click on the object to get the

450
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,199
rotation handles and hold your control

451
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,319
key and grab this corner handle and

452
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:08,120
rotate it left four steps so one 2 3

453
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,199
four and when you do that you should see

454
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,000
these left edges are flat against the

455
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,319
bounding box of the object

456
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,360
selection now I'll grab my nodes tool

457
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,040
select these three nodes up here hold my

458
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,880
control key and click and drag these up

459
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,800
like

460
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
that go back to my selection tool click

461
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,079
on the object again to get the rotation

462
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
handles and and now I'm going to hold

463
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
control and rotate it four steps

464
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
clockwise so in the other direction now

465
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,199
so this time I will go to the right 1 2

466
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,319
3 four and again we're holding control

467
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,000
the whole time we do this to lock it

468
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,199
into 15 Dee increments like

469
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,720
that and once that's done let's

470
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,240
rightclick the object and go to

471
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,079
duplicate and I want to make this a

472
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,240
different color just so I can

473
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
differentiate it I'm going to make this

474
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,199
green and then I'll rightclick this and

475
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,279
duplicate it again and I'll make this

476
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,720
one a different color as well so I'll

477
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
make this one red and I will turn on

478
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,199
snapping by clicking this magnet icon up

479
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,360
here in the top right corner of the

480
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,599
screen and I want to take this object

481
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,480
and just snap the corners there right

482
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,319
about there like that so that the bottom

483
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,000
area this green kind of looks like a

484
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,679
green check mark and once that's done

485
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,000
hold your shift key and click on the

486
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,480
green object so that you have both of

487
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,839
these objects selected here and go to

488
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,599
path and select

489
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,959
difference now I'm going to use the

490
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,679
offset path effects so let me come over

491
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,880
here to my path effects menu if you

492
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,600
don't have a path effects menu just go

493
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,200
to path and select path

494
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,240
effects and the path effect I'm looking

495
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
for is offset so I'm going to use this

496
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
search box right here and type off and

497
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,440
there it is right there

498
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,080
offset I'll grab my nodes tool and I

499
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,520
will make sure first of all make sure

500
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,559
you have these options enabled down here

501
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
we want the the join set to miter units

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
this is not really important so you can

503
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,679
ignore that offset zero and miter limit

504
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,120
4 and then use these settings as well

505
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,640
and once that's set set I will grab this

506
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,520
red circle and click and drag this down

507
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,360
like

508
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,799
that about that

509
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,360
far and once that's done you can go to

510
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
path object to path to finalize that and

511
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,039
now we can grab our selection tool

512
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,559
select both of these objects click on it

513
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
to get the rotation handle and hold your

514
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
control key and rotate it to the right

515
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,360
one two two steps like that now you can

516
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,200
click off of it to deselect everything

517
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
take just this green object grab your

518
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,240
nodes to tool and take these two nodes

519
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
right here and hold your control key and

520
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
click and drag them out like that we

521
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,200
want this to to extend beyond that black

522
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,919
shape and now we can go back to our

523
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,000
selection tool select everything let me

524
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,559
turn off the snapping Now by clicking

525
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,159
this magnet icon again and now I can

526
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,679
click on the object to get the rotation

527
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,760
handles and now I'm going to hold

528
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,799
control and rotate it to the left two

529
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:56,240
steps so one two and now I will go to

530
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,400
path difference and that right there is

531
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,760
the effect we're looking for so now I

532
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,080
have to make the corners of these a

533
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,480
little rounded because as of right now

534
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
they're a little too Square so to do

535
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
that I'm going to grab my nodes tool

536
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
click on the book to select it add the

537
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,760
corners live path effect and I'm going

538
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
to select these four nodes over here on

539
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,679
the left and I will grab one of these

540
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,880
handles one of these white knots and

541
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
scale that in like that just to make

542
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,360
these Corners

543
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,880
rounded and then I'll come over here and

544
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,280
do the same thing I want to select these

545
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,320
three notes

546
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,960
and give them a little bit of a rounded

547
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,480
Edge as

548
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,200
well and then I'll come over here and do

549
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,080
the same thing select these nodes on the

550
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
right hand side and scale them down it's

551
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,320
good to scale each of these segments

552
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,679
individually because the amount that you

553
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,919
want around them is going to be

554
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,480
different for each side so it's you get

555
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,520
a better result doing it this way and

556
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
I'll come up here and use this one as

557
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
well so I'll click on that one and this

558
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
should be the last one right here I'll

559
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,159
I'll r that off a little

560
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,159
bit and there we go I'm going to click

561
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,679
on the square button up here to convert

562
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,039
to a

563
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,200
path okay so there we go there's the

564
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,080
book icon now one final part of the book

565
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,400
icon if you notice here I put a little

566
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,360
bit of a bookmark down there just to

567
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
emphasize that it's a book it makes it

568
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,600
look more like a book when you do that

569
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,480
so to create that bookmark I'm just

570
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,520
going to grab my rectangle tool and I'll

571
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,240
click and drag to draw a rectangle over

572
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,120
this portion of the object I'm going to

573
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
grab my selection tool click on it again

574
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,400
to get the rotation handles but instead

575
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,799
of rotating we're going to Shear we're

576
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,760
going to use the icon over here on the

577
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,480
right hand side and hold the option key

578
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,120
or the ALT key if you're on Windows and

579
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,960
just bring this down two

580
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,760
steps so that the edges match in

581
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
Direction like that and we can bring

582
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
this right about

583
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,880
there and I'm going to scale that down a

584
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,200
little bit let me try that

585
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,840
again and if you need to make the this

586
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,799
bottom longer or shorter I'm placing it

587
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,960
so that the top Edge goes halfway

588
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
through the books pages here and I want

589
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,280
this to be a little outside of the

590
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,360
bottom so let me grab the nodes tool and

591
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,080
let me convert this to a path I'll go to

592
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,720
path object to path and now I can take

593
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
those nodes and hold control and move

594
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,679
them up like that and I can add new

595
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,159
nodes in there as well with those two

596
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,640
nodes selected I can click on this

597
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,600
button over here that says add new

598
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
nodes and just select this node right

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,880
here and move that up

600
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,240
and now I want to create a little bit of

601
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
an offset between the book and the

602
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
bookmark so let me make this black and

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,760
let me right click this and go to

604
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,000
duplicate I'll make the duplicate copy

605
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,960
white and I'll hold control and shift

606
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
and scale it up and I want to lower it

607
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,440
beneath the black object so I'll click

608
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,039
on the lower selection one step and then

609
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,600
I can just scale this up or down

610
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,720
depending on how much I want the offset

611
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,760
to be and again I'm holding control and

612
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,679
shift while I do this to scale it from

613
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,960
the center

614
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,200
and then once you're happy with how it

615
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,919
looks hold shift and click on the book

616
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
and go to path

617
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
difference and now we can select both

618
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,760
objects and go to path Union and we have

619
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,400
created our book

620
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,679
icon so that should do it for today's

621
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,559
tutorial we have created all six of

622
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,480
these icons using nothing but simple

623
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,600
shapes in inkscape if you have any

624
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,120
