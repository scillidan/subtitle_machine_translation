1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,480
taking a peek into the world of graphic

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,160
design for the first time can be a bit

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,120
overwhelming

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,560
there's a lot to learn in terms of

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,559
design principles color theory

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,960
techniques and branding in general but

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
if you want to create digital art then

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,320
you first have to familiarize yourself

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
with the tools that we use as graphic

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,119
designers

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,359
as of right now the industry standard is

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,880
the adobe creative suite with

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
applications like photoshop and

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,160
illustrator leading the way

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
these programs cost a lot of money

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
though and they come with some pretty

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
daunting hardware requirements

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,800
this can be a bit off-putting for

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,040
someone who just has a casual passing

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,559
interest in graphic design

21
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
and because of this you may find

22
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,000
yourself looking into free alternatives

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
like inkscape and

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
and wondering what the differences are

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
in this video i'll be comparing both

26
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
applications going over what their

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
intended uses are

28
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,399
the pros and cons of each and most

29
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,760
importantly i'll be helping you

30
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:59,840
determine which one is best for you

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,039
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,400
this video we'll be doing a

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
comprehensive comparison

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
of both inkscape and the first

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
thing you need to understand about

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
inkscape and is that

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,600
although they're both free and open

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
source design applications

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
they're actually quite different

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
comparing inkscape versus is no way

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,119
an apples to apples comparison

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
they're two very different tools with

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
very different intentions

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
let's have a closer look

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
despite the various different types of

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,119
graphic formats that exist in the world

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,640
the types we'll be looking at in this

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
video are raster and vector and it's

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,400
important to understand the differences

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,079
between these two because they both

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,000
represent the intended uses

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
for inkscape and rasterization is a

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
digital imagery format where the image

54
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
is made of individual colored boxes

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,079
known as pixels

56
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
and it's the format that you're probably

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
most familiar with this is commonly used

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,439
in things like photos

59
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
jpegs and other types of imagery you

60
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
commonly see on the web

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
the raster format is preferred if you're

62
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
going to do any kind of design work

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
where you'll be editing photographs but

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,759
it's not ideal for things like

65
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,960
illustrations and

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
designs where you need clean lines and

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,000
crisp edges

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
vector graphics on the other hand are a

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,520
different type of imagery format

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
altogether

71
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
vector graphics are not made of pixels

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
they're a series of coordinate points

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
that dictate the properties of a graphic

74
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
on an x and y

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
axis this makes vector graphics ideal

76
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,599
for things like illustrations

77
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
and designs where you need to have crisp

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
definitive edges

79
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
but it's not the ideal format for

80
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
working with photos where inkscape and

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
 come into play is that is

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
intended for working with raster imagery

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
making it ideal for editing photos and

84
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,239
inkscape

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
is a vector graphics editor making it

86
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
ideal for creating digital illustrations

87
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
let's take a more in-depth look at this

88
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
 is a free and open source

89
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
application that functions in the raster

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,280
environment

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
and it's widely recognized as the go-to

92
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
free alternative for adobe photoshop

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 which stands for general image

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
manipulation program

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
was originally founded in 1995 by

96
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
developers spencer kimball and peter

97
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
mattis who were both students at uc

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
berkeley at the time

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
according to wikipedia it was a

100
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
semester-long project they were working

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
on for the experimental computing

102
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
facility

103
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
as the years went by continued to

104
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,959
evolve as it saw lots of

105
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
updates and new features from a bustling

106
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
community of users and supporters

107
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,959
believe it or not was actually used

108
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
to create the original google logo in

109
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,920
1998

110
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
so keep that in mind for the next time

111
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,799
that somebody wants to tell you that

112
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,400
professional work can't be done with

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,599
open source software

114
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
 would be the ideal program for you

115
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
if you're a photographer looking to

116
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
retouch your photos

117
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
it allows you to adjust things like the

118
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
white balance the exposure

119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,560
color saturation and it allows for some

120
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
complex color correction using curves

121
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
and levels as well

122
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,519
it even has some cool features that

123
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
allow you to do things like alter the

124
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
shadows and highlights of a photograph

125
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,879
as well as the brightness and contrast

126
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
 would also be ideal if you're just

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
looking to crop an image or maybe crop

128
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
something from an image and remove

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
the background there's some really

130
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
advanced tools and features that allow

131
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
you to extract subjects from your photos

132
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
even if they have strands of hair and

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
other fine details that make it

134
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
difficult to define

135
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
you can also use to make some quick

136
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,799
and easy corrections to subtle

137
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
imperfections like

138
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
skin blemishes and yellow teeth you can

139
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
change the color of someone's eyes

140
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
create different color variations for a

141
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,759
product that you may be selling

142
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
and you can even restore color to black

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
and white photos and by the way i have

144
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
lessons demonstrating how to do all of

145
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,400
these things on my channel

146
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
if you want to check that out isn't

147
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
just used for editing photos though

148
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
you can also use it to create some

149
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
pretty cool effects to interact with

150
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,800
your photos like

151
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
a sliced effect mosaic collages 3d

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
text and you could even turn yourself

153
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
into a caricature if you'd like

154
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
finally is the right tool for you

155
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,360
if you do a lot of sketching

156
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
painting or airbrushing it comes

157
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,400
equipped with lots of

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
brushes and presets attended for

159
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,160
freehand drawing whether it be by mouse

160
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,520
or with a drawing tablet

161
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
you can even download brushes that were

162
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
intended for photoshop and use them in

163
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,080


164
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
and if you can't find the brush you're

165
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
looking for you can simply create a

166
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
custom brush of your own

167
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
although is a great tool it's not

168
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,320
the right tool for everything

169
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
a good example of this would be for

170
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
designing things like logos

171
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
symbols and other types of simple iconic

172
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
illustrations

173
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
these things have lots of individual

174
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
moving parts that you need to regularly

175
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
move around and transform

176
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
independent of the rest of the image and

177
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,039
the way that functions just

178
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
isn't suitable for this sort of thing it

179
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,479
can technically be done

180
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
but it's kind of like using a fork to

181
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
eat your cereal you're making life a

182
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
little more difficult for yourself than

183
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
it needs to be because

184
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
there's better tools that you can use

185
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
another problem with using is that

186
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,039
by nature

187
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
the designs you create will not be

188
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
scalable you can scale

189
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
down without a problem but if you try to

190
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
enlarge your image you're going to end

191
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
up with pixelation

192
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
or in other words the individual colored

193
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
boxes that make up the image

194
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
are going to become more visible this

195
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,960
reduces the quality and resolution of

196
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,919
the image

197
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
if you want a more dynamic graphic that

198
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
can be scaled to fit

199
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
many different sizes and applications

200
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
then it's best to stick with vectors

201
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
let's talk a little bit about inkscape

202
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
now unlike

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
inkscape doesn't work with pixels it's a

204
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
vector graphics editor and it's widely

205
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
recognized as the best free alternative

206
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,800
to adobe illustrator

207
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
inkscape started out as a code fork for

208
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,960
sodipode an open source vector graphics

209
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,919
editor that was discontinued in 2004.

210
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
the project was led by developers ted

211
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
gould bryce harrington

212
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
nathan hearst and another developer who

213
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
goes by the name mental guy

214
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
inkscape has come a long way since then

215
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
they've added lots of useful features

216
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,759
like

217
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,639
live path effects text manipulation and

218
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
various third-party extensions

219
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
the core functionality of inkscape

220
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
remains the same though so you never

221
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,840
quite feel like you have to relearn

222
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,400
anything

223
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
despite all of the additions and

224
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
improvements

225
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
inkscape would be the best tool to use

226
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
for designing logos

227
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,000
logo design is unique from other types

228
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
of design because logos are typically

229
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
used in a wider variety of contexts

230
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
a logo needs to be scaled up large

231
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
enough to work as a sign

232
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
and resize to fit various different

233
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,199
dimensions

234
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
one of the benefits of working with

235
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,639
vector graphics is that they can be

236
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,520
scaled up

237
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
infinitely without quality loss this

238
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
means that you can take your logo and

239
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
enlarge it for use on a billboard or the

240
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,479
side of a van

241
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,960
without having to worry about pixelation

242
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
the vector format is the best

243
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
platform for providing a logo with the

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,960
versatility that it needs

245
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,880
inkscape is also useful when it comes to

246
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
creating simple illustrations like icons

247
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
buttons and user interface inkscape

248
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
makes it easy to work with simple shapes

249
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,680
and objects that can be combined and

250
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,599
transformed into whatever you like

251
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,280
you can also adjust the coordinate

252
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
points of an object otherwise known as

253
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,919
nodes

254
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
to create your custom shapes another

255
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
thing inkscape is great for is creating

256
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
digital illustrations

257
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
mascots and characters with a

258
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,879
cartoon-like style

259
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
this can technically be done with

260
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
as well but the vector format allows you

261
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
to give your illustrations clean

262
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
crisp and definitive lines making

263
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
inkscape the ideal tool for this

264
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
and if you're creating characters for a

265
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
2d game design then you're going to need

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
the scalable benefit

267
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,000
of working with vectors as well inkscape

268
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
would also be the best tool for

269
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
designing graphics for mobile

270
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,319
applications like

271
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
app icons splash screens buttons and

272
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
various other types of user interface

273
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
the vector format is great for this

274
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
because it provides the versatility

275
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
needed for these designs to fit

276
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
any screen resolution without quality

277
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,159
loss

278
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
finally the illustrative nature of

279
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
inkscape allows you to create some other

280
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
unique types of designs like

281
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
infographics charts and repeatable

282
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,080
background tiles with an abstract

283
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,399
pattern

284
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
one of the downsides of inkscape is that

285
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
you can only work with photos in a very

286
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
limited capacity

287
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
since inkscape is intended for creating

288
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,600
vector designs

289
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
there's really not much you can do with

290
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
rasterized photographs

291
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
you can create clipping paths to remove

292
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,080
the background or

293
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
even use them as a texture mask if you

294
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,279
like but that's about it

295
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
if you're looking to do any kind of

296
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
extensive photo editing

297
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
you're better off sticking with

298
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
another downside to using inkscape is

299
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
that it's not ideal for doing any kind

300
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
of painting or sketching

301
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
there are tools that allow you to paint

302
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
and sketch in inkscape but they should

303
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
only be used in a limited capacity

304
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
the way that vector graphics works is

305
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
that you'll put a lot of strain on your

306
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,959
hardware

307
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
if you create too many brush strokes and

308
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
the file size will be enormous

309
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
not only that but you won't get all of

310
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
the brush settings and realistic

311
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,279
textures that you get

312
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,240
with something like

313
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
the application that you should use when

314
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
choosing between inkscape and

315
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
depends entirely on the type of design

316
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
work you're doing

317
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,440
if you're working with a lot of photos

318
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
you should probably stick to

319
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
but if you're creating simple

320
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
illustrations then you're better off

321
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,279
with inkscape

322
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,279
one software is not objectively better

323
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
than the other it depends entirely on

324
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
the context of what you're designing

325
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
if you're wondering if it's more

326
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,399
important to learn one over the other

327
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,640
it's not they're both equally important

328
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,079
as a graphic designer you should

329
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,519
familiarize yourself with both

330
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,000
vector and raster design knowing how to

331
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,839
work with both allows you to create some

332
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
really dynamic designs combining

333
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
elements from both inkscape

334
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
and and it'll make you a more

335
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
complete designer as well

336
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
if you'd like to learn more about

337
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
inkscape and i have hundreds of

338
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
tutorials on this channel that will walk

339
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
you through each step in such a way that

340
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,640
even a first-time user could follow

341
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,200
along

342
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
i also have video courses for each

343
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
application where i go through every

344
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
tool and feature and explain how it all

345
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
works

346
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
and that should do it for today's video

347
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
if you have any questions for which

348
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
software you should use for a particular

349
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,760
type of design that i may not have

350
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
covered in this video

351
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,040
just leave a comment below and as always

352
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,839
thanks for watching

353
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
you
