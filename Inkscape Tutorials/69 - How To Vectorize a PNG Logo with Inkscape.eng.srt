1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,280
if the only copies you have for your

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,220
logo are rasterized formats like PNG and

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,859
jpg then you won't be able to reap the

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,440
benefits of having a vector SVG file

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,019
like infinite scaling and being able to

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,490
edit your logo in the future in that

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
case you'll need to generate a vector

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,020
copy of your logo using vector design

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,550
software and that's what I'll be

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:31,050
demonstrating in this video this is Nick

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,850
with logos by Nick comm and in this

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,380
tutorial I'll be demonstrating two

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,850
different ways in which you can take a

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,149
logo in PNG format and trace a vector

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,059
SVG copy of it but before we get started

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,379
if you'd like to learn more about how

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,300
Inkscape works be sure to check out my

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,160
Inkscape masterclass it's a collection

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
of over 60 videos where I go over every

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,210
tool and feature in Inkscape and I

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,920
explain what it is and demonstrate how

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,270
it works I'll have a link in the

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,350
description of the video if you want to

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,600
check that out so getting started as you

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,579
can see I have Inkscape opened up here

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,320
on my screen and the first thing I want

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,030
to do is just set up the documents that

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,530
we are all working with a similar layout

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,360
I want to come up here to where it says

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,360
enable snapping and turn that off and

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,350
then I want to come up here to where it

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,360
says view make sure we have custom

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,189
selected and then come over here to

34
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,950
where it says view go to zoom view zoom

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,310
and zoom in at 1 to 1 so what I'm going

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,619
to do now is I'm going to import my PNG

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,990
logo into Inkscape and the way that I'm

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,670
going to do that is by opening the

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,080
folder where it's located and in

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,299
clicking and dragging the file onto the

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,100
canvas now you won't be able to see me

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,659
doing this because I have the folder

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,909
opened up on my other monitor but I am

44
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,189
clicking and dragging the file onto the

45
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,930
canvas they are in Inkscape now we're

46
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,430
gonna hit this little menu that pops up

47
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm going to choose embed I'm going to

48
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,600
choose default import resolution and

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,729
then I'm going to choose none I'll click

50
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,460
OK and there you can see that is the

51
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,680
Inkscape logo that I will be using for

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,329
this demonstration now let me just zoom

53
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,979
in on this just to show you that this is

54
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,920
indeed a raster format this is not a

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,140
vector design so let me zoom back out

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,090
here what I want to do now is I want to

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,340
change the size of my page border so

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,259
that it fits the size of the logo here

59
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,209
so to do that I'm going to select the

60
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,080
logo as you can see here and go to file

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,900
properties and I want to expand this

62
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,030
menu that says resize page to content

63
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,640
and then down here where it says resize

64
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,290
page to drawing or selection go ahead

65
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,120
and click that and it's going to change

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,080
the page boundaries to where the logo is

67
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,440
so let me go ahead and close out of that

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,850
so like I said at the beginning of the

69
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,440
video there's two different ways where

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,330
we can go about tracing a vector copy of

71
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,550
this design one is an easier way where

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,990
it's kind of like an auto trace function

73
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,510
using the trace bitmap feature and if

74
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,580
your design is so complicated that that

75
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,410
won't work you'll have to manually trace

76
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,640
it so I'm gonna show you both on you

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,130
show you the auto trace feature first I

78
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,020
want to select the logo just make sure

79
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,850
you have the logo selected here you'll

80
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,200
notice you have it selected when you see

81
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,480
these arrows enabled and I want to come

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,370
up here to where it says path and I want

83
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,910
to go to trace bitmap and under this

84
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,580
menu we have these two different options

85
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,190
single scan and multiple scans for this

86
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,720
design it's just black and white so I'm

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,850
going to leave it as single scan if your

88
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,350
design has colors you might want to

89
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,090
click on multiple scans and then you can

90
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,860
choose the number of colors in the scan

91
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,350
right there but this design is just

92
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,519
black and white so I'm gonna leave it a

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,959
single scan I'm going to leave these

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,000
defaults just as they are and I'm going

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,980
to click update and it's gonna show you

96
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,540
a preview of what's going to be traced

97
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,000
in the preview window here now for these

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
default settings this worked pretty well

99
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,720
that's exactly what I'm looking to do

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,700
right there if yours didn't come out as

101
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,110
well you may have to adjust these

102
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,370
settings a little bit and play with them

103
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,170
a little bit may even want to change the

104
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,430
the type of a trace that you do here but

105
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,750
this worked well for me so I was going

106
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,390
to click OK and it's going to generate a

107
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,400
vector copy right on top of that so let

108
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,280
me close out of that menu I'm gonna take

109
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,840
this if I move this out of the way you

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,330
can see now this is the vector copy this

111
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,100
is the original this is the vector and

112
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,630
I'll zoom in on that just to show you

113
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,940
that is indeed a vector copy you can

114
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,950
grab the nodes tool and you can edit

115
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,930
those nodes individually like you would

116
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,170
with any other vector object so what you

117
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,700
can do is now you can color that in you

118
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,230
can do whatever you want with that one

119
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,630
thing you may notice is that the filled

120
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,910
in area right here the filled in area

121
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,760
where is white is now negative space its

122
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,440
transparency in there if you're okay

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,610
with that then you're good to go if

124
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,380
you'd like to fill that in with the

125
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,400
color or fill it in

126
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,710
white as I did here you can use the

127
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,270
bucket fill tool for that so let me make

128
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,190
this black the way it was before

129
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,350
let me grab the bucket fill tool and I'm

130
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,630
gonna click on that that empty space

131
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,370
right there to fill it in now it filled

132
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,229
it in with the color black I'm just

133
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,330
gonna change this to red to annouce so I

134
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,880
can see the difference here and if you

135
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
notice it's sticking out of the edges a

136
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,750
little bit so I'm going to change that

137
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,370
by going to path dynamic offset and I'm

138
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,449
going to take this little note up here

139
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,919
and just pull that out so that it

140
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,509
believes out into the design like that

141
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,669
now let me finalize that by going to

142
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,460
path object to path let me go back to

143
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,960
the Select tool and I want to lower this

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,190
to the bottom I'm gonna click this

145
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,690
button that says lower selection to the

146
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,970
bottom and now it's lowered beneath the

147
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,410
design there and I can make that white

148
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,240
and as you can see that is no longer

149
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,860
transparent that is now filled with

150
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,530
white and down here you could do the

151
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,970
same thing because this is negative

152
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,550
space as well so that's the auto trace

153
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,680
that's the automated way of tracing a

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,020
vector copy of your logo if that doesn't

155
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,669
work because that feature won't always

156
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,009
work for more elaborate designs if your

157
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,039
design is it maybe it's like not a high

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
enough resolution that that feature can

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,669
work you'll have to manually trace a

160
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,039
copy of that using the Bezier a pen so

161
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
let me show you how to do that now the

162
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,130
first thing I want to do over here is

163
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,349
open up the filling stroke menu with

164
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,820
this button over here the keyboard

165
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,970
shortcut would be ctrl shift F on to

166
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,070
take the original logo right here and I

167
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,630
want to bring me opacity down in half so

168
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,370
I can see what I'm doing as a trace over

169
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,220
it and I want to grab the Bezier pen

170
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,139
which is over here or you could press B

171
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,330
on the keyboard and depending on the

172
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,580
type of design you have this design has

173
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,370
a lot of curves and bends and contours

174
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,530
and stuff for this sort of design I want

175
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,810
to use the b-spline setting of the tool

176
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm gonna click b-splines

177
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,930
what this does is it basically forces

178
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,909
you to draw curved lines it's kind of

179
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,560
like training wheels for the pen tool if

180
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,020
you've never used the pen tool before

181
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,030
this is a great option to use because it

182
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,560
forces you to draw curved lines that

183
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,330
will be able that'll make it easier for

184
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,099
you to trace this design right here so

185
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,870
let me get rid of that I'm gonna go

186
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,760
ahead and start tracing around this

187
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,310
design right here and to move the page

188
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,930
around basic functions I'm just pressing

189
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,010
down the mouse wheel I'm moving the

190
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,570
mouse and to zoom in and out I'm holding

191
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,010
ctrl and rolling up and down the mouse

192
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,110
wheel so I'm just going to go around and

193
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,540
points going around the design over here

194
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,910
to trace to trace a shape going around

195
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,460
the logo and if at any point you need to

196
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,740
create a sharp corner because this tool

197
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,110
setting will not allow you to create

198
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,330
corners by default what you can do is

199
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,490
just hold shift and then click and then

200
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,900
it'll allow you to create a corner as

201
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,040
you can see there but I'll be

202
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,450
demonstrating that in a minute when I go

203
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,580
over this area right here so let me undo

204
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,890
that I'm gonna go and trace over this

205
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,840
logo really quickly I'm just gonna do a

206
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,780
very quick and rudimentary tracing of

207
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,640
this because I'm not actually trying to

208
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
make a copy of this logo I'm just doing

209
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,680
this for a demonstration

210
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,150
okay so once you're finished tracing

211
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,650
around your object here you can just

212
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,150
click on the original node right there

213
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,160
to close the path and if you zoom out

214
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,020
you can see let me grab the Select tool

215
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,729
move this you can see we've traced a

216
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:33,520
shape over that shape right there so let

217
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
me put that back what I want to do now

218
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,979
is trace this other shape right here so

219
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,500
let me go back to the Bessie a penny let

220
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,720
me zoom in I'm going to start tracing

221
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,970
around to this and this is where I'd

222
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,050
like to demonstrate the the corner

223
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,220
feature so I'm gonna bring this over

224
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,620
here like this and again right here we

225
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,909
have a sharp corner so I'm gonna hold

226
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,530
shift and click and there you go now you

227
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,270
have a sharp corner same thing up here

228
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,039
we have another corner area hold shift

229
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,080
click in fact for the rest of these

230
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
points I'm gonna be holding shift the

231
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,949
whole time to create sharp corners like

232
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,380
that until we get right there and now I

233
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,940
collect all of shift and get back to

234
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,970
tracing around this design like this now

235
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,250
like I said before this b-spline setting

236
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,199
in this tool it's pretty much like

237
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,240
training wheels for the pen tool there's

238
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,729
easier there's easier ways to do this if

239
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,199
you're more advanced with using this

240
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,940
software but this tutorial is not for

241
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,889
advanced users this tutorial is for

242
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,560
newcomers to Inkscape who just need to

243
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,140
create a vector tracing of a logo that

244
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,539
they have in PNG format so let me go

245
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,149
ahead and finish tracing this back to

246
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,070
the starting point like that looking

247
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,179
pretty good now I'm gonna go ahead and

248
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,889
trace this part down here as well

249
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,970
okay so as you can see I have finished

250
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,920
up I've went and created these shapes as

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,660
well and the shape and that shape as

252
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,310
well so I don't know what to do now is

253
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,380
we have the shape we have the designs

254
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,300
wrong we just have to color it in now so

255
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,830
let me grab the Select tool let me click

256
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,390
on the original logo at the back there

257
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,160
at the bottom and bring the opacity of

258
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,260
that all the way back up now I'm just

259
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,520
gonna move this out of the way for now

260
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,250
if you want to color your design in with

261
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,779
the same color as your original design

262
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,310
head what you can do is you could just

263
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,830
click on the shape grab the dropper tool

264
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,270
which is over here and then grab a

265
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,850
selection of that color now this is just

266
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,860
black and white so I mean I could just

267
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,270
click the black and white colors down

268
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,610
here but I'm doing this assuming that

269
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,990
your logo that you're trying to check

270
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,850
trace is in color so I'm going to show

271
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,080
you how to do this as if this were in

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,850
color let me go back to the select tool

273
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,710
click on this shape I want to make that

274
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,460
white as well

275
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,230
if you notice you can't see the white

276
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,279
there because it's a white background

277
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,380
it's it's blending in against it but it

278
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,210
is indeed filled with white let me go

279
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,529
back to the dropper fill that in with

280
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,960
white and I want to get rid of that

281
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,490
those black outlines as well to get rid

282
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,200
of the black outline just hold shift and

283
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,130
click on the red X down here now let me

284
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,360
go back to the Select tool let me take

285
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,370
this shape I wanna get rid of that black

286
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,930
outline as well I'm gonna hold shift

287
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,839
click on the X and then finally I'm

288
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,250
gonna make the larger shape over here

289
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm gonna make that black hold shift

290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
click on the X click this shape do the

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,750
same thing just fill it in with its

292
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,570
intended colors you can use the dropper

293
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,130
tool like I did previously or you can

294
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,330
just fill it in manually with these

295
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,850
colors down here like I'm doing there's

296
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,380
also other ways you can fill you can

297
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,050
choose based on RGB HSL if you have like

298
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,270
an HTML like a hex code for your for

299
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,290
your design you'd like to fill it with

300
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,279
you can put it right there

301
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,850
followed by FF so what I'm going to do

302
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,140
now is I'm going to convert this to a

303
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,910
path I'm going to select over everything

304
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,830
click and drag over everything and go to

305
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,410
path object to path and that's gonna

306
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,080
change that from be spline shapes to

307
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,080
actual true vector paths now we can take

308
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,580
the original logo and get rid of that

309
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,680
and as you can see we've finished we

310
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,959
have traced our vector logo so all we

311
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,150
have to do now is save a vector file

312
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,040
effective copy of it so to do that I'll

313
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,800
go to file save as and I'm going to save

314
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,070
it as a dot SVG file or in Inkscape SVG

315
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,230
file or if you'd like to export it as a

316
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,520
PNG like let's say you

317
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,280
want to enlarge it let's say the whole

318
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,960
point of vectorizing your logo is that

319
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,430
you could enlarge it like that and then

320
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,530
export a copy of it what you can do is

321
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,280
go to file export PNG image and then

322
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,280
from here you can choose export as you

323
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,020
can click on that choose your name and

324
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,310
location right there and then click

325
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,580
export to export it and I think that

326
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,930
should do it for this tutorial so that

327
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,640
is how you can go about creating a

328
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,000
vector copy of your rasterized PNG logos

329
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,920
with Inkscape if you have any questions

330
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,210
leave a comment below and as always

331
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,880
thanks for watching
