00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,719
this is nick with logos by nick.com and

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,160
in this tutorial i'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
how you can create this

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,320
shiny gold text using inkscape but

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,680
before we get started if you'd like to

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
learn everything that there is to know

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,000
about inkscape

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
be sure to check out my inkscape master

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
class it's a collection of over 60

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,080
videos

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
where i go over every tool and feature

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
in inkscape and i explain what it is and

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,439
demonstrate how it works

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,640
i'll have a link in the description of

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
the video if you want to check that out

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,320
so to get us started here in inkscape

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
let's first set up the document so that

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
we all have a similar workflow

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
come up here to where it says view make

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
sure you have custom selected

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
and then come up to zoom and zoom in at

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,719
one to one

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
like that and then we want to make sure

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,800
that we have snapping disabled for this

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,719
tutorial so up here at the very far top

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,239
left where it says enable snapping

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
go ahead and disable that and that will

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
be good to get started so

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
the first step is to create some text so

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
i'm going to grab the text tool right

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,440
here

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,800
i'm going to click on the canvas to get

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
the blinking cursor and for this

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
tutorial i will be using the word

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
gold text and i'm going to triple click

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
that to highlight all of it

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
and change the font so let's open up the

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
text editor up here and the font i'm

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
going to be using for this tutorial is

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,560
called

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
irs or ayers however it's pronounced i

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
would recommend using this font if you'd

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,000
like to make this

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
effect work because for whatever reason

46
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
it just works really well with this font

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
i've tried it with other fonts that

48
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,080
didn't quite

49
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,159
look right but with this font it really

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
pops so i'll put a link in the

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,880
description to where you can download

52
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
this font for free

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
if you want to give that a try so go

54
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,920
ahead and click apply now

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
and now i'm going to make this bigger so

56
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
let me grab the select tool

57
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
and i'm going to grab this arrow and

58
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,079
just scale this up i'm going to hold

59
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
ctrl so it locks the proportions like

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
and now what i'm going to do is color

62
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
this in in order to make this look like

63
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,119
gold i'm going to have to apply a

64
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,000
gradient

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
and the colors that i use in the

66
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
gradient are very important in fact

67
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,960
they're so important that i've written

68
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
down the color codes for each individual

69
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,079
shade of the gradient

70
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
and i will post them in the description

71
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
box of the video so that you can follow

72
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
along with what i'm doing exactly you

73
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,240
can go ahead and

74
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
copy and paste them yourself so let's

75
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,160
apply a gradient here i'm going to grab

76
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
the uh

77
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
the edit objects colors gradients and

78
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,319
stroke menu right here the fill and

79
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,360
stroke menu

80
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
you can click that button or press ctrl

81
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
shift and f to open that up

82
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
and i'm going to come over here under

83
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,720
the fill tab

84
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm going to look for where it says

85
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
linear gradient right there and click on

86
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,160
that

87
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
and then i'm going to grab the gradient

88
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
tool and i'm going to click on this

89
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
little round stop right here

90
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
and i'm going to bring the opacity of

91
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,720
that up so that right now it's a

92
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
gradient going from black

93
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
to black so i will take this node right

94
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,720
here and put this at the bottom of the

95
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,760
gradient

96
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
or the bottom of the text and i will

97
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,120
take this node and put this at the top

98
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
of the text and i will hold ctrl so that

99
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,599
it's going up

100
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
vertically just like that okay so right

101
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
now we have two different stops in this

102
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
gradient

103
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
this gold color is going to have five

104
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
stops in it so i have to add

105
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,360
three stops to this gradient so to do

106
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,959
that i'm just going to double click on

107
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
the line right here to add a new stop in

108
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,200
there

109
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
i'll double click again to add another

110
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
one and then one more

111
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,319
and now what i have to do is select each

112
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,000
of these stops and

113
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
paste the color codes into them so i'll

114
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
start at the top right here

115
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
working from top to bottom i'm gonna i

116
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
have a notepad opened on my other

117
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
monitor with these color codes written

118
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
out that i could just paste in there

119
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
like i said i will have these in the

120
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
description box of the video so you can

121
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,799
do the same you can just go ahead and

122
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,319
copy and paste them right in

123
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,680
so i'm going to select each stop and

124
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
just paste them into the rgba box here

125
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,239
like that

126
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
as you see me doing take this one as

127
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,799
well

128
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,599
paste that in there

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,640
this one here paste that in here

130
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
and then finally one more to go i'm just

131
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
ctrl c to copy

132
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,680
ctrl v to paste just like that

133
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
and now i want to adjust the positions

134
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
of these colors on the gradient i want

135
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,799
to take this top one and move this a

136
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,480
little closer to the top like that

137
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
and i want to take this one right here

138
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
this middle one which is like the dark

139
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,799
the darker shade and bring that towards

140
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,560
the top third or the bottom of the top

141
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
third of the text right there right

142
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
about there looks pretty good

143
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
and then take this one right here and

144
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
bring this up closer towards that darker

145
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
one like that

146
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,799
and that right there is the look we're

147
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
going for this is starting uh starting

148
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,920
to come together it's starting to look

149
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
like gold text

150
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
only now we're going to add a little bit

151
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
of depth to it so let's grab the select

152
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,600
tool

153
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
and let's create a duplicate copy of

154
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
this text let's right click this and go

155
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
to duplicate

156
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
and let's give this a outline otherwise

157
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,919
known as a stroke i'm going to i'm just

158
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,280
going to use the color red for now i'm

159
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,840
going to hold

160
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
shift and click on the color red to give

161
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
that an outline like that

162
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,040
and then i'm going to send that to the

163
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
back i'm going to come up here to this

164
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,199
button that says

165
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
lower selection to the bottom click on

166
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
that so that it goes behind the original

167
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,520
text

168
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
and i'll come over here to the stroke

169
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
style tab and i want to increase the

170
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
size of this stroke

171
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
maybe not that much let me change this

172
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
to pixels let's try something like

173
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
six or maybe five

174
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
maybe not that much i want i don't want

175
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
this to be too thick maybe it's four and

176
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
a half that should be pretty good

177
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
okay that looks good enough right there

178
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
somewhere there about it doesn't have to

179
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,680
be exactly the same size as mine so just

180
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
go ahead and eyeball it

181
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
and now i want to give that red outline

182
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,080
the same gradient

183
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
that the gold text has only in reverse

184
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,400
so let's come over here to the stroke

185
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
paint tab

186
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
and click on linear gradient and we're

187
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,039
going to choose our gradient from our

188
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
list over here

189
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
and now let's grab the gradient tool so

190
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
we can adjust the position of that

191
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
gradient

192
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
so right here on the vertical axis you

193
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
can see our original gradient

194
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
over here on the horizontal axis that's

195
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
the current gradient for the stroke

196
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
so what i want to do is do the same

197
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
thing with the original gradient only in

198
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
reverse if you see here

199
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
on the original gradient we have the

200
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
circle node on top

201
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
and the square node on the bottom i want

202
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
to do the opposite for this one i want

203
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
to put the circle node on the bottom

204
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,400
oops didn't mean to do that put the

205
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
circle node on the bottom

206
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
and put the square note on the top and

207
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
again again just hold ctrl to lock it

208
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,280
onto the

209
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,000
vertical axis like that and there you go

210
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,919
so let's grab the select tool now

211
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
click off of that to deselect everything

212
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
it's starting to come together now what

213
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,560
i'm going to do is i'm going to break

214
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,919
these letters apart and adjust the

215
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,360
spacing between them so

216
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
let's click and drag over both of these

217
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
text objects and go to path

218
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,160
object to path and then ungroup over

219
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
here where it says ungroup selected

220
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,280
groups

221
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
and now it's individual letters like

222
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,319
that so i'm going to click and drag over

223
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,039
this letter g

224
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,000
i'm going to zoom in on this a little

225
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
bit i'm going to hold ctrl and roll up

226
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
the mouse wheel a couple of times to

227
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
zoom in

228
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,039
and i'm just going to hold ctrl i'm

229
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
going to click and drag over this letter

230
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
g right here so i have both objects

231
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,280
selected

232
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
and i'm going to hold ctrl and just move

233
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
this over like that i'm just manually

234
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
adjusting the spacing between these

235
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
letters here as you can see

236
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
clicking and dragging over all three

237
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,039
letters

238
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
moving it in then i'm going to click and

239
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,880
drag over the whole word move that in

240
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
and again while we're doing this we're

241
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
holding ctrl on the keyboard so that it

242
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
locks it onto the vertical axis like

243
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,039
that

244
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
okay that looks pretty good move this in

245
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
and then finally this one this one's a

246
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
little too close to the t so i'm going

247
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
to move that back just a tiny bit

248
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,919
and maybe i'll put some more space

249
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
between the two words like that

250
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
that right there looks good so we'll

251
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
click off of that to deselect everything

252
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
now what i want to do is unify

253
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
these letters together these these uh

254
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,400
the letters on top anyway

255
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
so i'm going to click on the letter g

256
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,360
and then i'm going to hold shift and

257
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
click on all of the other letters

258
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
so that we have all of them selected and

259
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
unify them together by going to path

260
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
union and the reason why i do that is

261
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
because now i want to create

262
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
sort of like a reflective light or like

263
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
a shine coming off of the top of this

264
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,199
text here and i'm going to need a

265
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
duplicate copy of that text to do that

266
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,599
so

267
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
with the text selected right click it

268
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
and go to duplicate

269
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
and make the duplicate copy white and

270
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
now we're going to create a little bit

271
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
of an offset

272
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
of this white text right here so let's

273
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,639
come over here to the

274
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
path effects menu we'll go to path and

275
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
click on path effects

276
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
and i'm going to click the plus icon

277
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
here to add a new path effect

278
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,759
and the path effect we're looking for is

279
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
offset which is right here

280
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
and with offset enabled i'm going to

281
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
zoom in a little bit what i want to do

282
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
is grab the edit paths by nodes tool

283
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
which is right here

284
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
and what you should be looking for is

285
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
this little circle node right here if

286
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
you notice everything else is a square

287
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,199
node we're looking for this circle node

288
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,479
right here let me zoom in on that a

289
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
little bit

290
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
and i'm going to take this circle node

291
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
and just click and drag that down a

292
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
little bit just to

293
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
give that a little bit of an offset and

294
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,599
what you notice what it's doing here is

295
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,280
it's shaving off a little space

296
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
off of around the edges of the letters

297
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,120
like that which is exactly what we're

298
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
looking for

299
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,599
okay so i'm happy with how that looks

300
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,958
i'm going to finalize it by going to

301
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,399
path

302
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
path object to path grab the select tool

303
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
i'm going to press 1 on the keyboard to

304
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
zoom back out to a hundred percent

305
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
and let's close out of the path effects

306
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
menu we don't need that anymore

307
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
now what i'm gonna do is i'm going to

308
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
create an ellipse going over the top

309
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
half of this white text here so let me

310
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
grab these circles and ellipses tool

311
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,080
i'll click and drag to create an ellipse

312
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
going over the top of it like that

313
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
and i want to get rid of that outline

314
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
let's hold shift and click the little

315
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
red x down here to get rid of that

316
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,000
outline

317
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,959
and i'm just going to make this a

318
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
contrasting color for now maybe

319
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
something like green

320
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
bring the opacity down so i can see

321
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
where it lines up with the rest of the

322
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,000
text

323
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
and let me grab the select tool right

324
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
here now if you notice the bottom edge

325
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
of this green ellipse

326
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
i'm paying attention to where it lines

327
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
up with the text i want it above this

328
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,959
part of the g

329
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
but below this part of the g right here

330
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
right about here we want this to be in

331
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
about the top third of the text as you

332
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
see here i like this position

333
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,279
so i'm going to leave that as it is i'm

334
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
going to hold shift click the white text

335
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
so that we have the green ellipse and

336
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
the white text selected at the same time

337
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,200
and go to path intersection

338
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
and what we have to do now is give this

339
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,560
thing a gradient so let's come over here

340
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,120
to the fill

341
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
tab and click on the linear gradient

342
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
button

343
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
and then grab the gradient tool over

344
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,440
here and take this

345
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
little uh white stop over here and put

346
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
this towards the bottom of that white

347
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,279
object

348
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
and then take this circle stop and put

349
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,120
this towards the top i'm going to hold

350
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
ctrl

351
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
to lock it onto the vertical axis like

352
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
that now if you notice i'm not putting

353
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,920
this

354
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
exactly at the bottom of the white text

355
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
there i'm putting it slightly below so

356
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
it's not so

357
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
it's not so harsh and this one right

358
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,320
here this is not going all the way up to

359
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
the top i'm putting this down to about

360
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
here like that

361
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
and at this point you may have to adjust

362
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
the position of the original gradient so

363
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
let me click on the gold text

364
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
and i'm going to take this if you notice

365
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,480
i'm going to take this stop right here

366
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
and bring that down a little bit

367
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
and bring this down a little bit as well

368
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
maybe bring this down to here

369
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
whoops messed up there if you mess up

370
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,880
and do something like this just hit ctrl

371
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,399
z on the keyboard to undo what you just

372
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
did

373
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
okay that's looking that's looking

374
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,040
pretty good right there okay so let me

375
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
grab the select tool

376
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
click off of it to deselect everything

377
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,760
and the final step would be to add a

378
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
little bit of a drop shadow to this to

379
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
make it pop a little more so to do that

380
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,279
i'm going to click on the gold text i'm

381
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
going to duplicate it by pressing ctrl d

382
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
on the keyboard and i'm going to make

383
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
that black and i'm going to bring this

384
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,200
down

385
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
slightly down i'm going to bring it down

386
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
slightly

387
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,279
and to the right slightly and i'm gonna

388
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,399
lower that to the bottom with this

389
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
button over here that says lower

390
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
selection to the bottom

391
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
maybe even use the arrow keys to adjust

392
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
it a little bit that right there is

393
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
pretty good

394
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
and i will give this a little bit of a

395
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
blur

396
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,040
just like that and then finally bring

397
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,640
the opacity down a little bit

398
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,480
maybe reduce the blur reduce the opacity

399
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
and you get the idea you just play with

400
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
a little bit and as you can see we've

401
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
finished creating our gold text now one

402
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
final thing i would i would recommend

403
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,959
using this for a dark background for

404
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,920
whatever reason this

405
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,320
gold text effect really pops better on

406
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
dark backgrounds so

407
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
let me create a rectangle going over

408
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
this whole thing like this

409
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,560
let me bring the opacity of that all the

410
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
way up grab the select tool

411
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
lower that to the bottom and maybe make

412
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,240
this like a lighter shade of gray over

413
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
here where it says fill

414
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
i'm going to select hsl and i'm gonna

415
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
look at this l row like this and just

416
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
bring that down a little bit

417
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
and then hold shift and click on the

418
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
text and uh center it up

419
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
using the alignment menu so i'm gonna

420
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,519
open up the align and distribute menu

421
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
over here and set this the relative to

422
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
set it to last selected center it on the

423
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
vertical and horizontal axis like that

424
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
and you may want to adjust the drop

425
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,240
shadow drop shadow a little bit so let

426
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
me zoom in a little more

427
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,839
let me just bring this out

428
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,279
let me go back to the fill and stroke

429
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
menu maybe give this

430
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
bring the opacity of it up now since

431
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,079
it's on a darker background

432
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
maybe make that a little darker and i

433
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
think i will call it a day right there

434
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
so that should do it for this tutorial

435
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
that is how you can go about creating

436
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
that gold text

437
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
using inkscape so if you have any

438
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
questions just leave a comment below and

439
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
as always thanks for watching

440
