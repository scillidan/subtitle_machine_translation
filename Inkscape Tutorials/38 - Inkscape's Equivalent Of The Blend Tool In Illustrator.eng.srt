1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
in adobe illustrator there's a really

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,679
handy tool called the blend tool which

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,520
allows you to make lots of copies of

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,359
objects and blend them together in

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,720
creative ways

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
inkscape doesn't have such a tool but it

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
does come with a couple of extensions

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
that when used in tandem can mimic the

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
function of illustrator's blend tool in

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,350
today's tutorial i'll be showing you how

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:28,800
[Music]

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
so getting us started here in inkscape

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,519
the first thing we're going to have a

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,520
look at is the scatter extension which

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
allows you to take a single object and

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
repeat it along a path as many times as

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
you'd like in order to use this

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,879
extension we're going to need a path to

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
place our object on so for this

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
demonstration i'm going to be creating a

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
spiral you can create whatever path

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,920
you'd like this is just the example i'm

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
going to use for this lesson

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,800
if you'd like to follow along with what

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
i'm doing just go ahead and pause the

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
video and input these values up here

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
into the tool settings for the spiral

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,120
tool and then we'll be good to get

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
started once that's done i'm going to

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,879
click and drag on the canvas like that

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
to create my spiral and that right there

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
represents the path that my object is

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
going to follow

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
so now i have to actually create the

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
object for this demonstration i'll just

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
be using a simple circle i'm going to

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
grab the circles and ellipses tool click

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
and drag on the canvas and then hold

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,119
ctrl to ensure that it's a perfectly

40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
round circle like that

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,159
and i'm going to give this a gradient

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,360
just to help

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
demonstrate this effect a little better

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
i'm going to make this a solid fill

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
color first of something like pink

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
and then i'm going to apply a gradient

47
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,560
so let me grab

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
the fill and stroke menu which is

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
located up here or you can press ctrl

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
shift and f on the keyboard to access it

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
and up here under the fill tab i'm just

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
going to click this button over here

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
that says linear gradient and as you can

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
see right here we now have a linear

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
gradient on this object so this half of

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
the circle is pink i want to make this

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,920
half a different color so let me click

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,479
on this handle right here and i'm going

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
to change this color to something else

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
i'm going to use

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
a lighter shade of blue like that

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,000
and now i'm going to take the handles of

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
this gradient and just move this like

64
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
this i'm going to put this one up here

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
i'm going to hold ctrl to lock it onto

66
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
the axis so we have a nice vertical

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
gradient going like that

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
now what i'm going to do oh by the way

69
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
to zoom in and out hold ctrl roll up and

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,200
down the mouse wheel

71
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
so now what i'm going to do is i'm going

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
to grab the selection tool

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,239
and now in order to make this object

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
follow along this path we have to make

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
sure that this object is positioned

76
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
above the path now

77
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
since we created the path first and then

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
the object second we don't have to worry

79
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
about this this is already positioned

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
above the path here but i just needed to

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
point that out in case you're using this

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
extension in other ways and you can't

83
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
figure out why it works

84
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
the object always has to be positioned

85
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,120
above the path like that okay and you

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
can change the positioning over here

87
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
using these up and down

88
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
you can lower objects raise objects see

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
right now the path is above the object

90
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,760
which is no good we want this to be on

91
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
top

92
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
okay so with that in place let me select

93
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
both of these objects and i'm going to

94
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,400
go to extensions

95
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,840
generate from path

96
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
scatter okay so now the the settings i'm

97
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
going to use here

98
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
as you can see follow path orientation

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
check stretch spaces to fit skeleton

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
link uh length check

101
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,000
spaces between copies i'm going to start

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
off with negative 10

103
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,360
and then we'll take it from there normal

104
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
offset we're gonna leave that at zero

105
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
zero cloned and randomly we're gonna

106
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
leave everything as it is here

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,879
and what i'm gonna do once i have

108
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
negative 10 put in here i'm gonna i'm

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
gonna enable the live preview

110
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
and it's going to show you what happens

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
here it's going to show you the object

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
being repeated along the path

113
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,159
now if you notice there's lots of

114
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
spacing between these objects we want

115
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
the spacing to be decreased so we can

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
have more objects so it looks more like

117
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
a solid line in order to do that we're

118
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
going to have to decrease this number

119
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
here the spaces between copies i'm going

120
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,599
to start off with negative 15. we

121
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,959
started out with negative 10 i'm going

122
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,640
to go in increments of 5. so i'm going

123
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
to go down to negative 15 now and see

124
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
how that looks

125
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,799
okay so that looks a little better now

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,319
the reason why i'm going in increments

127
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
of five is because if you go too far too

128
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
much it's actually going to lock up this

129
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
uh it's gonna lock up the extension and

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,519
it's not gonna work you'll see here in

131
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
just a minute let me try negative 20 now

132
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,439
okay that's looking a lot better i'm

133
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,639
going to go a little further just for

134
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
demonstration purposes here let's try

135
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
negative 25.

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,440
and this is what happens right here you

137
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
get this error message this means that

138
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
you've gone too far for the for your

139
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
object and there's no more like this is

140
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
as much as the extension can do now this

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
morning message is a good thing here

142
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
because a few years ago i actually made

143
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
a video demonstrating how to use this

144
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
extension in an older version of

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
inkscape and once you go too far what it

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
used to do is it used to crash your

147
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
system and you had to restart everything

148
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
now they've added this uh fix in there

149
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
that stops it from crashing so we're

150
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
going to go ahead and click ok and we're

151
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,840
going to go back to 20 and we're going

152
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
to try 21 instead

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,479
okay that looks good let's try 22.

154
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
and that's too far so it looks like 21

155
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,080
is the max i'm going to set it to 21.

156
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
and once i'm finished i'm going to click

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
ok or apply and then close and there you

158
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,080
go it generated that object right there

159
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
kind of like how the blend tool works in

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
adobe illustrator

161
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,199
okay now if you zoom in on this you can

162
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,680
see it just consists of lots of tiny

163
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
individual circles you may be able to

164
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
see some of the color banding in there

165
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,240
that's because this is a bunch of

166
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
individual circles okay but if you zoom

167
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,360
out

168
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
it looks nice and fluid nice and smooth

169
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
like that so now let's have a look at

170
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
the other extension in inkscape that

171
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
allows you to perform some of the

172
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
functions that the blend tool does in

173
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
illustrator this would be the

174
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
interpolate tool so to demonstrate what

175
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
interpolate does let me create a text

176
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,280
object i'm going to grab my text tool

177
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
i'm going to click on the canvas right

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
here and i'm going to type

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
blend in all caps i'm going to triple

180
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,160
click the text to highlight it and i'm

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
going to change the font by clicking on

182
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
the text editor up here

183
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,039
and the font i'm using for this

184
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,880
demonstration is called league

185
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
league gothic which is right there

186
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
click apply and there we go let me get

187
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,400
out of this menu because it otherwise

188
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
slows the system down let me grab the

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,479
selection tool now let me

190
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
make this larger hold ctrl while i'm

191
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
scaling to ensure that it maintains the

192
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,080
aspect ratio

193
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
and i'm going to put this copy over here

194
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
maybe i'll make this a little smaller i

195
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
want to make this

196
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
a different color i want to make this

197
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
yellow

198
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
and what i want to do is change this

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
from a text object to an actual path

200
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
otherwise this is not going to work this

201
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
interpolate extension it only works on

202
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
objects that are paths so to convert

203
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
this to a path i'll go to path object to

204
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,600
path

205
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,199
and now i need to ungroup it i'll go to

206
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
object

207
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
on group

208
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
and then i'll unify it all together by

209
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
going to path

210
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
union

211
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
and now i'm going to duplicate this

212
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
object by right clicking it going to

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,199
duplicate

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
and i'll make this one bigger i'm

215
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
holding ctrl while i'm scaling here to

216
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
maintain the aspect ratio and i'll move

217
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
this one down here

218
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,520
and i'm going to change this to a

219
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
different color i'll go with pink

220
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
and now i'm going to select both of

221
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
these objects at the same time

222
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,280
go to extensions generate from path and

223
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
interpolate

224
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
now the settings i'll be using here as

225
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
you can see the exponent is one

226
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
interpolation steps this is the number

227
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
of copies that will be created between

228
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
these two i'm going to start out with

229
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
five and then i'll take it from there

230
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,039
and these settings as you can see here

231
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,800
we want to leave these settings as you

232
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
see on my screen and once you're ready

233
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
click live preview

234
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
and as you can see it took the two

235
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
objects and created five copies of them

236
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
based on their properties now as you can

237
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
see these copies they range in size they

238
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
go from large to small as these two

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
objects did and then the color

240
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
transitions as well as you can see there

241
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,599
so if i could actually i could actually

242
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,039
increase this from five to something

243
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
like 10

244
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
and then you end up with something like

245
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
that or i could even go as far as 20

246
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,599
and then you end up with something like

247
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,400
that

248
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
go a little further 30

249
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,599
now it's looking more fluid like that

250
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,280
and unlike the other extension i don't

251
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
think this one has a break off point

252
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
where it locks up and closes i think you

253
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
could go infinitely with this so that's

254
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
40.

255
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
here's how 50 looks

256
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
and there you go i think you should get

257
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,840
the idea let me bring this back down to

258
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
something a little more reasonable like

259
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
10.

260
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,599
click apply

261
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,360
and then close

262
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
and then once you're finished as you can

263
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,120
see here it created new copies from this

264
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,039
so your original copies are still there

265
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,000
in place you don't need to make

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
duplicates you don't need to make backup

267
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,039
copies because this is going to generate

268
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,120
a new copy based on this and if you want

269
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
to edit this further you can just go to

270
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
object on group

271
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
and now as you can see this consists of

272
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
a bunch of individual objects that were

273
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,600
generated using that extension

274
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
so i think that should do it for this

275
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
tutorial that is how you can go about

276
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,440
working around a lack of the blend tool

277
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
in inkscape if you found this lesson

278
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
useful then consider checking out my

279
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
inkscape master class it's a collection

280
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
of over 60 videos where i go over all of

281
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
the tools and features in inkscape and i

282
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
explain what they are and demonstrate

283
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
how they work kind of like how i did in

284
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
this video we even have a private

285
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
community where you can ask questions

286
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
and get help from me anytime you want

287
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
and best of all there's no monthly

288
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
membership fees you just pay 17

289
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
one time and you're in for life i'll

290
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
have some information about that down

291
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
below if you want to check that out as

292
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
