00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,040
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,000
you can use the trace

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
bitmap feature located in inkscape and

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,880
what trace bitmap does is it allows you

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
to create a vector tracing of a

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,920
photograph

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
using an automated algorithm instead of

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,680
having to trace it manually using the

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,199
bezier pen and other tools

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,039
okay now the benefit of using trace

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
bitmap is that it saves you a lot of

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,399
time it creates a really

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,880
quick tracing of any photograph you have

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,399
the downside of using it though

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,920
is that it doesn't always work with

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
every photo based on the composition of

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
your photo sometimes it produces some

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
sloppy results so

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
you're never going to get a 100 accurate

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
tracing of your photograph

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
unless you trace it manually but the

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,719
downside of tracing it manually is that

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,079
it takes a lot of time and a little bit

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,360
of expertise as well

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,039
so the method you should use depends on

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,640
the image you're working with and what

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
it is you're trying to achieve

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,079
if you're just trying to create a quick

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,199
sloppy

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,680
automated vector tracing of your photo

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
trace bitmap is great for that so let me

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
show you how to go about doing that i

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,799
have these two example photos here

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,880
i'm going to work with this one first

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
i'm going to come over here to where it

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,080
says

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
path i'm going to click on trace bitmap

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
now if you notice up here we have three

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
different tabs

42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,080
trace bitmap pixel art and help

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,759
for this tutorial i'm going to focus on

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
trace bitmap pixel art would be a

45
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
separate tutorial altogether so let's

46
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
focus on trace bitmap for now

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
if you notice in here we have two

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
different options we have single scan

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,759
and we have multiple scans

50
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,960
and the difference between the two of

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
them basically is one is for black and

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,759
white

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
one is for color so single scan would

54
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,960
create a

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
single vector object it would trace a

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
single vector object over your photo

57
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
in one single color so it would be good

58
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
for creating things like silhouettes

59
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
or maybe even creating vector textures

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
whereas multiple scans would be good for

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,159
creating

62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
uh vector tracings of photos that have a

63
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,439
lot of color and you want to retain some

64
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
of that color so let me demonstrate how

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
each works i'm going to choose single

66
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680
scan for this image because this is a

67
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,719
black and white image

68
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
and i just want to create like a like a

69
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
silhouette sort of tracing this

70
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
now if you look at this drop down over

71
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
here we have a lot of different options

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,759
and these

73
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,239
options all what these options do is

74
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,440
they basically

75
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,720
trace your image using a different

76
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
sort of algorithm and the one that you

77
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,879
should use depends on the composition of

78
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
the image you're working with because

79
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
every image is different

80
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
okay so when you're tracing a bitmap

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,959
you're going to want to cycle through

82
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,160
these different options

83
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
and update the preview to see how it

84
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
looks to find out which one is best for

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
your photo

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,599
so for this one i'm just going to leave

87
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,040
the cut the brightness cut off i'm going

88
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
to click update

89
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
and it shows you a preview here of the

90
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,519
vector tracing that's going to be made

91
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,560
from the image

92
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
okay that looks pretty good i like how

93
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
that looks i'm going to click ok to

94
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
create the tracing

95
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,280
and if you notice it created a vector

96
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,920
tracing

97
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,720
over the photo now this here is a true

98
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
vector object you can change the color

99
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,959
of that

100
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
you can perform path operations on that

101
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
you can do everything that you would

102
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
normally do with the vector object

103
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
with this right here let me turn off

104
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
snapping now let me get rid of that

105
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
let me show you some of these other

106
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,319
options here just to show you what i

107
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
mean if you come down here to like

108
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,599
something like edge detection and you

109
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
click update you'll notice

110
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
it doesn't really trace anything in the

111
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,680
image there's some speckles

112
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
caught in the uh in the tracing there

113
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
but it's not really what i'm going for

114
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
so for this sort of image

115
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
edge detection wouldn't be good but

116
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
maybe for a different type of image

117
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,239
edge detection would work perfectly so

118
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,680
really like i said it depends on the

119
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,799
image you're working with so whenever

120
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
you're trying to trace vectors

121
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
using this tool make sure to cycle

122
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
through these and see which one gives

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
you the best result

124
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
okay see this right here as an example

125
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
if i click ok

126
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
we end up with a pretty sloppy tracing

127
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
this tracing right here it's also got a

128
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
lot of nodes in it this is a really

129
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,799
complicated tracing so

130
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
uh one thing i'd like to warn you about

131
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
when using this tool is to be very

132
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,319
careful

133
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,560
about making complicated tracings like

134
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
this now my computer was able to handle

135
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
this because i have a pretty powerful

136
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
computer but if you're using like your

137
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
your average

138
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
consumer grade computer this would

139
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
probably lock up

140
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
inkscape and cause you to have to

141
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,439
restart the application so

142
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
always be careful when you're creating

143
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,319
traces that you're not creating

144
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
something too complicated

145
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
okay so let me show you now if you go to

146
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,080
uh any of these options

147
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
here brightness cutoff you have some

148
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
settings that you can tweak over here

149
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
the brightness threshold let me update

150
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,680
this

151
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,360
right now by default it's at 0.450 if i

152
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,199
change that to something like point

153
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
eight and click update it you can see it

154
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
changes

155
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
the tracing it changes the algorithm of

156
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
the tracing there there's more of the

157
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
shadows being caught up in the tracing

158
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,199
there

159
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,639
so this is just one of those things that

160
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
gives you more granular control over

161
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
your tracing

162
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
so when you're tracing an image just

163
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
cycle through these different settings

164
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
see which one works best and then you

165
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,479
can alter these settings a little bit to

166
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,040
see

167
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
to really fine-tune your tracing now

168
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
this looked a lot better before

169
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
at 0.45 so i'm going to put that back to

170
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
what it was and click update

171
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
and then over here we have invert image

172
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,240
if you click on that and you click

173
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
update

174
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
you can see it creates an inverted

175
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
tracing if i click ok to create that

176
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,919
tracing

177
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,680
it pretty much creates a vector tracing

178
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,960
of the negative space

179
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
and the subject it creates a vector

180
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
tracing of the negative space of the

181
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,199
image

182
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
and the subject becomes the negative

183
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
space of the tracing as you can see

184
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,039
there

185
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,240
okay so that's another thing you might

186
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,919
want to pay attention to whenever you're

187
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
tracing an image so let me undo that

188
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,800
let me show you now how to trace images

189
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
with color if i select this image right

190
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,199
here

191
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
i'm going to click on multiple scans now

192
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
because i'm working with color

193
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
and again we have all of these different

194
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
options we can cycle through i'm going

195
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
to choose colors for this one

196
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
i'm going to click update and it's

197
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
showing you how the vector tracing would

198
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,919
look in color i'm going to click ok to

199
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,919
generate that

200
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,520
and as you can see here let me zoom in

201
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
on this if you zoom out it looks

202
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
photorealistic but if you zoom in you

203
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
can see that this is indeed a vector

204
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
tracing

205
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,160
and now the flaws in using auto tracing

206
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
become a little more apparent because

207
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,400
you can see there's a lot of

208
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
imperfections in here there's a lot of

209
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,039
speckling and

210
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
a lot of details that got included in

211
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
there that probably shouldn't have been

212
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
but like i said with an auto tracing you

213
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
can't expect it to be perfect it's never

214
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,880
going to be

215
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
exact okay so let me come back over here

216
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
this image over here we have the number

217
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
of scans

218
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
scans pretty much represent the number

219
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,919
of colors

220
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,440
in an image okay so with this tracing i

221
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
created eight scans meaning it's gonna

222
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
use eight different colors

223
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,400
okay now if i decrease that to like

224
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
maybe something like three

225
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
and click update it's only going to use

226
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
three colors

227
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
okay as you can see there and inversely

228
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
if i increase it from eight to maybe

229
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,039
something like 16

230
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,639
it includes more of the colors and if

231
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
you click ok

232
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
you end up with a bigger tracing with a

233
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
lot of different options but at the same

234
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
time

235
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
it looks a little more photorealistic

236
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
and just to show you that this is indeed

237
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
a vector tracing i'm going to ungroup

238
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,840
this i'm going to go to object

239
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,280
ungroup and it's going to ungroup it

240
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,639
into lots of different little parts here

241
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,840
and you could zoom in

242
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
and you could take these parts and

243
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,319
change them and do whatever you want

244
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,759
with them

245
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,120
okay then finally if you click on this

246
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
image up here you'll notice there's a

247
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
remove background setting

248
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
now if you enable that it's going to

249
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,400
remove the white background

250
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
from this image here the problem with

251
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
using this though is it it only works on

252
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,120
images

253
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,639
where the background is really defined

254
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
this image is a great example because

255
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
the background is white so if

256
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
the software will have no problem

257
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
determining where the background is

258
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,160
located

259
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
on more complex images it's just going

260
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
to exclude areas of the image

261
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
that it thinks is the background even if

262
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
it's not exactly accurate so let me just

263
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
show you how that looks i'm going to

264
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,199
click

265
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,599
update i'm just going to click ok

266
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
and it created a vector tracing minus

267
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
the background i'm going to place it

268
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,039
over this object here so you can see

269
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,560
okay now you get an idea i've removed

270
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
the background now some of it

271
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
some of it got wrong like you see here

272
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,039
there's a little bit of negative space

273
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,479
in there showing through the image

274
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
beneath it is showing through there so

275
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,840
it removes some of that as well but

276
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
that's okay because that's easy to fill

277
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,599
in

278
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,639
otherwise but that's how that part works

279
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
and then finally down here we have some

280
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,919
settings that you can play with if

281
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
if you've cycled through these options

282
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
and you've played with these

283
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
adjustments and you still can't get it

284
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,879
quite right

285
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
you can adjust these as well we down

286
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,039
here we have speckles

287
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,360
this says ignore small spots in the in

288
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
the bitmap

289
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,919
the idea behind this is that it

290
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,199
eliminates some of this

291
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
fragmentation in here some of these

292
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
speckles but as you can see it's not

293
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,039
always perfect

294
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
maybe if i were to increase this a

295
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
little bit maybe it would do a little

296
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,759
better job but i'm not going to play

297
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,720
with that for now

298
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
over here smooth corners that's enabled

299
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
by default whenever you create a vector

300
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
tracing at something usually

301
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
you end up with sharp corners in your

302
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
image they end up smooth when you trace

303
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,159
them

304
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,559
okay so uh that's enabled by default and

305
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
then over here optimize try to optimize

306
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
paths by joining a paste

307
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
adjacent bezier curve segments the idea

308
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
behind that is that whenever you create

309
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
a vector tracing of an image

310
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
you're creating a really complex uh

311
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
vector object with a lot of nodes in it

312
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
let me show you as an example here i'm

313
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,680
going to trace this image i'm going to

314
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
click on this

315
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
as you can see my computer is struggling

316
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,839
with this a little bit i'm going to

317
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
click on update

318
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
i'll click ok now i may regret trying

319
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,680
this but i'm going to give it a try

320
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,200
anyway i'm going to select this vector

321
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
object and i'm going to come over here

322
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
to the edit paths by nodes tool

323
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
okay now if you notice this image i mean

324
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,320
this

325
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
this vector object is made up of

326
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
hundreds maybe even thousands of little

327
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
nodes here

328
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
okay now when you create a vector object

329
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
with lots of nodes like that

330
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,839
um sometimes it'll lock up your computer

331
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
the idea behind optimize is that if you

332
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
increase this threshold it'll create

333
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
less of those nodes

334
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
okay so that's pretty useful in creating

335
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
a vector tracing that you can actually

336
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
work with without a crash in your system

337
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,040
but the downside is with less nodes it

338
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
may not be as accurate as a tracing

339
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
so i think that should do it for this

340
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,160
tutorial that is how you can go about

341
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
uh creating vector tracings of

342
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
photographs

343
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
using inkscape if you have any questions

344
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
leave a comment below and as always

345
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:05,839
thanks for watching
