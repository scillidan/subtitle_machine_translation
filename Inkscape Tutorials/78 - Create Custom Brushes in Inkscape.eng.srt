00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,910
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,590
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,269
how you can create your own custom

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,460
brushes in Inkscape and if you'd like to

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,140
learn more about how Inkscape works be

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,400
sure to check out my Inkscape

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,009
masterclass it's a collection of over 50

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,720
videos where I go over all of the tools

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,759
and features in Inkscape and I explain

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,259
what they are and demonstrate how they

12
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,700
work I'll have a link in the description

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,259
of the video if you want to check that

14
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,360
out so to get us started here in

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,920
Inkscape the way that this works is

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,620
Inkscape doesn't actually have a brushes

17
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,660
feature built in but what it does have

18
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,600
is it has tools like the pencil tool

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,760
over here which allow you to use a

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,949
custom shape based on what you have

21
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,600
copied to your clipboard and that's what

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,370
we'll be doing here so to show you an

23
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,809
example of how this works I'm just gonna

24
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,449
create a square over here a regular

25
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,809
perfectly symmetrical square like that

26
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,190
let me just convert this to a path by

27
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,980
going to path object to path let me

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,960
scale that down I'm gonna right click

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,120
this and I'm gonna go to copy and then

30
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,470
I'll come over here to the pencil tool

31
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,960
and if you notice over here I have these

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,630
settings I'm using create regular Bezier

33
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,909
path the smoothing I'm gonna have that

34
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,009
set to about 75 I'll explain that in a

35
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,930
minute and where it says shape I'm gonna

36
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,479
have this set to from a clipboard and if

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
I click and drag on the canvas like that

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,689
you'll notice what it basically do is it

39
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,790
took that square and stretched it out

40
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,040
along that path right here and if I go

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,570
to the edit pads by nodes tool you'll

42
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,860
notice you'll get a little handle right

43
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,229
here and you can stretch out the width

44
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,509
of this path right here and you could

45
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,350
even change the the path itself like how

46
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,600
it flows and everything like that so let

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,579
me get rid of this let me come back over

48
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,840
here to the pencil tool just to show you

49
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,159
something else here over here where it

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,920
says smoothing this determines how rough

51
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,600
or how smooth the line that you create

52
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,729
is if I bring this smoothing all the way

53
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,310
down to something like 10 and I leave it

54
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,140
there and then I go to create another

55
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,920
line you'll notice it's a lot more a lot

56
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,520
more of my hand tremors are reflected in

57
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,740
the the contour of that line right there

58
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,149
now let me undo that if I bring the

59
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,180
smoothing up even higher if I bring it

60
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,810
up too high to like maybe something like

61
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,500
92 I'll go to create a curved line and

62
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,360
won't curve as much as as I drew it

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,860
it'll be nice and smooth but it'll be

64
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,990
hard to get those real curves that you'd

65
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,610
like to draw in that line so I've found

66
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,880
that a good a good area is about 75 I

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,440
like to use about 75 that gives you a

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
nice fluid line without having any of

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,110
the the rough shakes from from your hand

70
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,870
so let me take this get rid of this now

71
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,460
let me show you how this can work with

72
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,110
like other custom shapes like stars I'm

73
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,030
gonna create this star over here I'm

74
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,190
gonna use a regular star instead of a

75
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,290
polygon I'm gonna use eight corners the

76
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,200
spoke ratio is 0.75 and rounded and

77
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,630
randomized both set at zero and I'm

78
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,980
gonna click and drag on the camp so I'm

79
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,390
just gonna hold ctrl and shift so we

80
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,930
create that star like that there we go

81
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,730
that's what I'm looking for and I'll go

82
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,920
to path object to path to convert that

83
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,230
to a path object and now I can grab the

84
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,820
Edit path by nodes tool and I'm just

85
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,320
gonna click and drag over all of those

86
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,630
nodes and click this little plus icon in

87
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,550
here to add some new nodes in there and

88
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,709
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

89
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,330
to extensions modify path jitter nodes

90
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,680
and I have this set here to 3.0 and 3.0

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,650
for both the X and y-axis the shift

92
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,690
nodes and shift handles both enabled and

93
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm gonna click on distribution we want

94
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,860
uniform I'm gonna click on live preview

95
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,209
just to see what that looks like and

96
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,709
that right there is what we're looking

97
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,350
for like a like a rough kind of it kind

98
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,970
of looks like an inkblot is what I'm

99
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,200
looking for there I'm gonna click a pie

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,900
and I'm actually gonna simplify this

101
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,510
path a little bit I'll go to path

102
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,100
simplify or you can just press ctrl L

103
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,959
and you might want to click that a few

104
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,940
more times I'll try ctrl L a couple more

105
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,510
times something like that looking pretty

106
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,190
good now let me scale that down I'm

107
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,840
gonna hold ctrl and shift and maintain

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,610
the proportions and now I'm gonna copy

109
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,590
that to the clipboard by right-clicking

110
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,810
it going to copy come back over here to

111
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,610
the pencil tool or the draw freehand

112
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,799
lines tool and then just click and drag

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,940
on the canvas like that and you'll

114
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,980
notice it draws like this nice it looks

115
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,170
like a streak of paint now if you come

116
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,850
back over here to the nodes tool you can

117
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,130
change the thickness of this to make it

118
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,228
look even better like that and when

119
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,850
you're drawing your lines let me come

120
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,290
back over here to the tool if when

121
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,729
you're drawing your lines you're getting

122
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,890
like an outline with no fill you can

123
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,300
change the settings of that up here

124
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,770
where it says fill and Stroke you just

125
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,470
click on that

126
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,750
and it has the tool settings right here

127
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,760
now I think by default that has this to

128
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,520
this tool zone style and has that set by

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,170
default but I just changed it to this

130
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,570
right here last use style so that's

131
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,580
another feature you can work with a

132
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,680
little further here in Inkscape so I

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
think that should do it for this

134
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,390
tutorial

135
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,500
oh wait you know what one more thing I

136
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
just want to show you once you're happy

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,790
with how your your your brushstroke

138
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,770
looks what you can do is you can

139
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,530
finalize it by going to path object to

140
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,810
path and now you can edit it and work

141
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,600
with it like any other path oops it has

142
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,060
individual nodes as you can see here so

143
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,560
I think that should do it

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,220
I think that should do it for this

145
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,910
tutorial if you
