1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,979
so let's go over how you can use

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,860
inkscape to delete part of an image on

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,540
my screen here I have this example image

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,400
opened up and for this demonstration I

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,960
will be removing the zebra from this

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,059
image so the result will be an area of

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,980
transparency where the zebra currently

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,199
is in order to accomplish this I'm going

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,940
to be creating a vector path in the

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,440
shape of my subject that I'd like to

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,180
delete and then I'll be creating an

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,160
inverse clipping path out of it so let's

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,140
go over how you can do this so in order

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,300
to create a shape over my subject here

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,099
I'm going to custom draw a shape using

16
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,420
the pen tool let me zoom in I'm going to

17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,159
hold Ctrl and roll up the mouse wheel a

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,780
couple of times to zoom in I'm going to

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,219
grab the bezier pen which is located

20
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,660
over here or you could press the letter

21
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,820
B on your keyboard

22
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,379
and the setting that I'm going to use

23
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,899
for this particular subject here is this

24
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,219
setting up here that says create B

25
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,660
spline

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,920
and once that's done I'm just going to

27
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,719
zoom in over here and I'm going to move

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,219
the page around by pressing down the

29
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,840
mouse wheel and moving the mouse and I'm

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
going to begin clicking to create points

31
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
around my subject here as you can see

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,199
here now that wasn't very accurate so

33
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,640
let me undo that if you want to undo the

34
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,780
points that you create at any point you

35
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,699
just have to press Ctrl Z I'm just going

36
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,159
to go and create a outline around my

37
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,280
subject using the pen tool like this and

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,720
with this setting with the B spline

39
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,100
setting you'll see it automatically

40
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,140
makes the lines curved but if at any

41
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,060
point you want to make a straight line I

42
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,860
mean a sharp corner like you see here

43
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,600
all you have to do is hold shift and

44
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,580
click and then it creates a sharp corner

45
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,200
as you can see there so I'm going to go

46
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,820
through here and I'm going to draw my

47
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,100
lines like this I'm going to hold shift

48
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,320
put a point here

49
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,600
continue along the inside of my path

50
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,040
here and I'm just going to go around

51
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,979
this entire subject and trace an outline

52
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,100
and once you're finished drawing your

53
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,240
line you can connect it back to the

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
starting point like that to close the

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,140
path and now we have our shape going

56
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,880
around the subject here now let me fill

57
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,560
this in with the color just so we can

58
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,000
see it I'm going to use the color green

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
here and I'm going to get rid of that

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,939
outline I'm going to hold shift and

61
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,100
click on this little red X down here and

62
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,560
now we have a subject that we can use to

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
delete part of our image now the thing

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,460
is if we use this object and create a

65
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,720
clipping mask what it's going to do is

66
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,920
the opposite it's going to delete

67
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,200
everything except for the zebra so we

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
want to create the inverse of that or an

69
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,760
inverse clipping path now inkscape has

70
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
an inverse clipping path sending built

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,300
in but unfortunately it only works with

72
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,980
Vector objects so in order to do this

73
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,660
with the rasterized photo like we have

74
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,040
here we're going to have to do this

75
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
manually so let me grab this selection

76
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
tool let me click off of the graphic to

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,020
deselect everything I'm now going to

78
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,819
create a rectangle in the size of this

79
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,260
image here I'm going to click on the

80
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,180
image and I'm going to go to edit

81
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,580
copy and then I'm going to grab my

82
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,840
rectangle tool and I'm going to click

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,340
and drag to create a rectangle like that

84
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,660
and I'm going to make this a different

85
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,160
color than the color we just used I'll

86
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,260
just go with blue for now and then I'll

87
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,120
go to edit

88
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,879
we're looking for paste size and paste

89
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,080
size

90
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
and now I'm going to grab the selection

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
tool and with this rectangle selected

92
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm going to hold shift and click on the

93
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
image so we haven't both selected and

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,620
then I'm going to open up the Align and

95
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,940
distribute menu which is over here on

96
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,319
the right if you don't have it opened

97
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,599
you can press Ctrl shift and a on the

98
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,239
keyboard or you can come over to where

99
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,840
it says object and select align and

100
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
distribute and the menu should open up

101
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
over here on the right now with this

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,580
menu open I want to make sure I have

103
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,440
last selected Chosen and then I'm going

104
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,180
to Center this up on the vertical and

105
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,920
horizontal axis like that and now I'm

106
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,300
going to click off of it to deselect

107
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,280
everything I'm going to click on just

108
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,739
the blue the blue square here and I'm

109
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,000
going to lower this beneath the green

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,319
object that we created so I'm going to

111
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,000
come up here to this menu

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,220
where it says a lower selection One Step

113
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,319
press that and it should lower it

114
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,420
beneath the object we just drew and now

115
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,980
I'm going to hold shift click on the

116
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
object so we have them both selected and

117
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
go to object and I'm sorry path and go

118
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,060
to difference and now we have this right

119
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,900
here

120
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,340
so now we can do is we can click and

121
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
drag over everything

122
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,700
and go to object

123
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,260
clip

124
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,760
set clip

125
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,280
and just like that we have deleted part

126
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,140
of the image

127
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,540
by creating a clipping mask now the good

128
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,500
thing about this is that it's

129
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,060
non-destructive meaning you can undo

130
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,560
this at any point if at any point you

131
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,900
want to put the deleted part of the

132
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,340
image back to where it was just select

133
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,280
the image and go to object clip and go

134
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,959
to release clip and there you go now

135
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,280
you're back to where you're started with

136
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,500
those objects as they are so I think

137
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
that should do it for this lesson that

138
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,620
is how you can use inkscape to delete

139
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,199
part of a pixel based rasterized image

140
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,298
if you found this lesson useful then

141
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,100
consider checking out my inkscape master

142
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,380
class it's a collection of over 60

143
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,240
videos where I go over all of the tools

144
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
and features in inkscape and I explain

145
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,780
what they are and demonstrate how they

146
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,580
work kind of like how I did in this

147
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,620
video we even have a private Community

148
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,600
where you can ask questions and get help

149
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,180
from me anytime you want and best of all

150
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,100
there's no monthly membership fees you

151
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,220
just pay 17 one time and you're in for

152
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,900
Life I'll have some information about

153
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,040
that down below if you want to check

154
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,139
