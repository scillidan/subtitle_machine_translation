1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
in this lesson we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,920
to use mesh gradients which is in my

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,720
opinion the most advanced feature in

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,700
inkscape so if you can get the hang of

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,200
how to use this then you should be

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,880
pretty Limitless with the rest of the

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,340
software before we get started though I

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,900
would recommend that you save your

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
document and get in the habit of

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
pressing Ctrl s every few steps because

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,199
this tool can be a little glitchy at

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,359
times and you may experience some

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,220
crashing so it would be good to save

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,660
your work so that you don't lose your

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,800
progress

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
so to get started I'm going to grab the

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,579
rectangle tool and I'm going to click

18
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,780
and drag on my canvas to draw a

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,280
rectangle like that

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,719
and I'm going to take this rounded

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,040
handle over here and bring this all the

22
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
way down so that we have rounded ends so

23
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
that we have this pill like shape

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
and then I'm going to convert that to a

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
path by going to path and selecting

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,020
object to path

27
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,460
so what I will do now is I will come

28
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,739
over here to my meshes tool you can

29
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,360
locate it over here in the toolbar I'm

30
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,100
going to click on that

31
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,500
and the way this tool works is it allows

32
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,440
you to assign colors to an object based

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,319
on a grid of coordinate points and

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,459
there's two different ways that you can

35
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,740
do this you have regular mesh gradients

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,439
and then you have conical gradients and

37
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,360
you can apply it to the fill or you can

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
apply to the stroke so I'm going to show

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
you how to use both of these starting

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,900
off with the regular mesh gradient

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,820
so if you notice up here in the tool

42
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,320
settings you'll see we have two

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
different settings here we have rows and

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,619
columns

45
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm going to start off with just two

46
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,159
rows and two columns so if yours doesn't

47
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,960
say two and two just manually type in

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
two and two and then take your cursor

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
and click and drag over your object like

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,920
that and you'll see that we now have a

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
grid of coordinate points placed over

52
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
the object

53
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,360
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,680
click and drag over all of those

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,000
coordinate points and I'm going to

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,159
change their color to something like

57
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,479
pink down here you could choose whatever

58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,820
color you'd like just choose a mid-tone

59
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,399
nothing too light or too dark

60
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,320
and what I'm going to do now is I'm

61
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,060
going to press escape to deselect those

62
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,860
nodes and I'm going to click on this

63
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,119
node right here I'm just going to bring

64
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,579
this towards the edge of the rectangle

65
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,140
right there and I'm going to take these

66
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,579
handles and just straighten them out

67
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,439
like that or rather round them so that

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,258
they they go along the Contour of this

69
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,360
object here and you may have to take

70
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,800
these handles and move them up a little

71
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,140
bit to accommodate that spacing

72
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,640
and I'm just going to adjust these

73
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,220
handles so that we have the edge of this

74
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,260
mesh going around the Contour of the

75
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,700
object

76
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,860
a little more smoothly

77
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,540
I'll take this handle move this out a

78
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
little more

79
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,080
I'll adjust this one down a little bit

80
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,360
and again we want a nice smooth Contour

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,620
there it doesn't have to be perfect

82
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,000
you're probably not going to get it

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,739
perfect but close enough is good enough

84
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,660
there like that and I'll do the same

85
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,640
thing with this node here I want these I

86
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,640
want my mesh to nicely hug the Contour

87
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,379
of my object so I'm going to adjust all

88
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,940
of these handles here until I have that

89
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,120
result

90
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,099
and then I'm going to come over here to

91
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,420
this side and do the same thing I'll

92
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,580
move this one out a little bit

93
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm going to move this I'm going to move

94
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,900
this node in close to the edge and I'll

95
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,580
take these handles and just move them

96
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,180
out like that

97
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,560
and once you've done that I'm going to

98
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
take this node here in the center and

99
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,940
I'm going to bring this down like this

100
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,560
and then I'm going to use these handles

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,080
over here to make it so that this line

102
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
kind of like dips down kind of kind of

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,099
sort of like follows the Contour of the

104
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,599
shape here I'll do this with both sides

105
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,920
as well I want to bring this down like

106
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,300
that

107
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,099
and now what we can do is we can click

108
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,019
on each of these coordinate points and

109
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,879
change their colors so if I click on

110
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,680
this coordinate point right here

111
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,420
I can hold shift and click on this

112
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,739
coordinate point over here as well I

113
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,659
have them both selected now and then I'm

114
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,159
going to hold shift and click on this

115
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,900
coordinate point over here and now I

116
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,159
have all three of those coordinate

117
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,019
points selected and I'm going to change

118
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,120
the color here just by darkening it a

119
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,799
little bit and you can see we end up

120
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,080
with the result like that

121
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,340
and then I'll do the same thing down

122
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,840
here I'll select these coordinate points

123
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,239
by holding shift and clicking on them

124
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,180
and I'll make these ones even darker

125
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,680
so you can see the result we're getting

126
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
here it kind of looks like a 3D pill now

127
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,060
if you notice we have a little bit of a

128
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,040
little bit of color error here so I'm

129
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,420
going to click on this handle right here

130
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,099
and I'm going to bring this handle up

131
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,379
just to adjust this a little bit just to

132
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,299
make this a little more smooth

133
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,680
there we go you may have to bring it up

134
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,060
a little bit

135
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,798
and I would recommend coming up here to

136
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,120
the smoothing and changing this from

137
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,639
Koontz to bicubic and that'll make

138
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,340
things just look even more smooth

139
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,919
so now we have dark we have a darker

140
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,120
gradient here on the bottom I'm going to

141
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,620
put a lighter gradient up top here so

142
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm going to double click this line

143
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,840
right here

144
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
and that's going to allow us to create a

145
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
new line there let me actually undo that

146
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,419
I'm going to press Ctrl Z to undo that

147
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm going to put that a little lower

148
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,320
there we go and I'll bring this handle

149
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
and move this up

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,180
I'll take this handle and bring it down

151
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,560
and I'm going to click on this node

152
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,300
right here and I'm going to move this

153
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,280
handle so that the Contour is going up

154
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,840
now like that and I'll do the same thing

155
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,160
over here on this side I'll bring this

156
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,900
up like that

157
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,720
and now I will click on this node right

158
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,180
here and I will make this white and you

159
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,740
can see the effect there now it kind of

160
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,560
looks like a 3D pill now if you want to

161
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
add even more in here you can you can

162
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,479
add more points to this grid so I'm

163
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,800
going to double click the line over here

164
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,900
and now we have another point to work

165
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,699
with I'm going to click on that one and

166
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm going to make this one white

167
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,759
and then I'll do the same thing over

168
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,259
here I'll click on this one or double

169
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,180
click on this one and make that white

170
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,039
there we go and if I zoom out and go to

171
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
my selection tool you can see what we've

172
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,759
done there we've used the mesh gradient

173
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,000
to create this 3D pill looking shape

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
so that's how the mesh gradient Works

175
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,960
let's have a look at the conical

176
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,560
gradient now

177
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,340
now let's have a look at how to use

178
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,500
conical gradients I'm going to grab my

179
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,180
circles and Ellipsis tool over here for

180
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,500
this demonstration we're going to create

181
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,840
a CD so I'm going to click and drag to

182
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,979
create a circle I'm going to hold the

183
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,539
control key so we have a perfectly round

184
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,979
circle like that

185
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,780
and let me grab my selection tool and

186
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,979
move this towards the center of the page

187
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,500
and zoom on zoom in on it a little bit

188
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm going to come back over here to my

189
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
meshes tool and now I'm going to come up

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
here and select this option that says

191
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
create conical gradient and this works

192
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
similarly to the regular mesh instead of

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,500
putting it on a rectangular grid though

194
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,780
it wraps it around a circle

195
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,039
so to show you what I mean I'm going to

196
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
change the rows and columns this time I

197
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,979
want one row and I want 20 columns 20 is

198
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,020
the maximum value for either of these

199
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,699
input boxes here so I'm going to go with

200
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,680
1 and 20 and now I'm going to click and

201
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
drag like that and you can see we now

202
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,780
have these nodes going in the direction

203
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,419
of a circle rather than on a rectangular

204
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,380
grid

205
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,419
so let me select all of these and I'm

206
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,639
going to change their color to 30 gray

207
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,319
you can access that by coming down here

208
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,759
to the color bar and hovering your

209
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,100
cursor over the colors if you notice

210
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,780
right here it says 30 gray I'm going to

211
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,979
choose that one

212
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,500
and now all of these are 20 gray and now

213
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm going to press the Escape key to

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,560
deselect them

215
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,240
and now I'm going to zoom in over here

216
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,660
I'm looking at the top Center Line right

217
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,400
here I'm going to double click this part

218
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
of the line right here right between

219
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,580
these two lines to add a new line in

220
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,280
here just like that and I'll come over

221
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,020
here and add a new line on this side as

222
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,900
well I'll double click that line

223
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
and then I'm going to come down here and

224
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,900
do the same thing to the bottom side I'm

225
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,880
going to starting off with the center

226
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,919
line as a reference move over here to

227
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,900
the left and put a new line in here and

228
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,979
then I'll come over to the right side

229
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,319
and do the same thing

230
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,180
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

231
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,280
going to click on this line right here

232
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
now when you click on the line you're

233
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,060
going to select it's going to select the

234
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,280
entire area right there and I'm going to

235
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,900
hold shift and I'm going to click on

236
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,300
this line to select that as well and now

237
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,120
I have both of those lines selected and

238
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,740
I'm going to change their color to

239
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,300
Yellow

240
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,520
and I'm going to make this a lighter

241
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,419
shade of yellow over here

242
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,560
and now I'm going to select the lines

243
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
next to it so I'm going to come over

244
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
here and click on this line right here

245
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,139
to the left and then I'll hold shift and

246
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,639
click on this line right here to the

247
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,360
right

248
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
and then I'll come down here and do the

249
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,240
same thing I'm going to hold shift click

250
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,860
on this line right here

251
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,599
to select it and you'll know it's

252
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,740
selected when you see that node

253
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,539
highlighted and then I'll hold shift and

254
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,639
click on this line as well now one thing

255
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,840
I want to point out when you're doing

256
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,940
this is to make sure that you're

257
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,440
selecting your line you're going to

258
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
hover your cursor over the line and when

259
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,919
it's directly placed over the line

260
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,979
you'll notice that a plus symbol

261
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,300
populates on the cursor letting you know

262
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,399
that it's active now make sure you see

263
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,839
that plus symbol because if it's not

264
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,099
there and you accidentally click you're

265
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,419
going to deselect the object and you're

266
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,440
going to have to start all over again

267
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
with your selection so I'm going to hold

268
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,039
shift and click on that and now I have

269
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,140
all four of those lines selected I'm

270
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,420
going to change their color to Pink

271
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,640
and I'm going to bring down

272
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,680
the lightness of that as well so that we

273
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,760
end up with something like that right

274
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
there

275
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,580
and now I'm going to do the same thing

276
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,320
again over here I'm going to select this

277
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,459
line out here

278
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,339
hold shift select this line over here

279
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,839
and then come down here and do the same

280
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,240
thing on this side select this line

281
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,459
and then this line

282
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,760
and these ones I'm going to make cyan

283
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,620
and again I'll use a lighter shade here

284
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,120
and now I want to make it look like the

285
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,580
disc is reflecting a glare of light so

286
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,260
I'm going to select this line right here

287
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,540
and then hold shift and select this line

288
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,519
over here on the other side and I will

289
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
make those ones white so that it looks

290
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
like it's a little glare of light

291
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,100
so you can see what we have here it's

292
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,080
starting to look like a CD

293
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,580
so now that we have that in place I'm

294
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,620
going to create another object on top of

295
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,360
this and apply a mesh gradient to that

296
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,700
as well so let me grab my selection tool

297
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,860
click on the object and then right click

298
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,140
it and go to duplicate and I'm just

299
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,580
going to change the color of the entire

300
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,959
object I'm just going to make that white

301
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,519
just to clear that mesh that was

302
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,140
previously on there

303
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,339
and now I'm going to go back to my

304
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,320
meshes tool and now I'm going to use the

305
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
opposite values instead of one row and

306
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,300
20 columns I'm going to use 20 rows and

307
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,860
one column

308
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,300
and now I'm going to click and drag like

309
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,180
that and now we have our conical

310
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,160
gradient going in circles as opposed to

311
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,180
lines

312
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,519
so let me select all of these nodes here

313
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,220
and remove their color by clicking on

314
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,959
the Red X down here

315
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
and now what I want to do is let me

316
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,680
press escape to deselect them I want to

317
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,959
select each node here

318
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,180
I want to select every other node going

319
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,399
up this vertical plane right here so I

320
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,200
selected this node I'm going to hold

321
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,940
shift I'm going to skip this node and

322
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm going to select the next one and I'm

323
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,120
just going to repeat that going all the

324
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,620
way up I'm going to select every other

325
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,480
node while holding shift so that I have

326
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,260
them all selected

327
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,200
and once you've done that you can fill

328
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,779
them in with white and now we have that

329
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,980
sort of effect right there and I'm going

330
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,180
to come down here to the bottom and do

331
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,399
the same thing I'll select this node and

332
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,620
again every other node going down this

333
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,279
vertical plane

334
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,100
and then finally I want to make these

335
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,440
areas if you notice the gradient sort of

336
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,480
ends right here this right hand side is

337
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,800
the end point of the gradient so I want

338
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,720
to make these areas white as well I'm

339
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,279
going to select these lines right here

340
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,079
I'm going to click on the line itself as

341
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,820
opposed to just the node and I'm going

342
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,260
to hold shift and go through here and

343
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,120
select each of the lines as well and

344
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,100
again not just the node but the entire

345
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,959
line we want the whole segment selected

346
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,019
and then I will make those white

347
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,240
just like that and now I'm going to grab

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,100
my selection tool I'm going to change

349
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,839
the blend mode of this object I'm going

350
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,980
to come over here to my fill and stroke

351
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,420
menu if you see over here where it says

352
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,100
blend mode just click on that and change

353
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,200
this to color burn

354
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,959
and now we have that effect right there

355
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,399
so I'm going to bring down the opacity

356
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,540
of this a little bit we don't want that

357
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,279
to be too prominent I'm going to bring

358
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
that down a little bit

359
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,060
and now I'm going to create some more

360
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,740
circles to place on top of here so it

361
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,360
looks more like a CD so let me grab my

362
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,279
circles and ellipses tool let me click

363
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,140
and drag to create another Circle

364
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm holding control while I do that to

365
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,399
lock the aspect ratio and let me bring

366
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,740
the opacity of this up and let me make

367
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,180
this a darker shade of gray something

368
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,800
like 60 percent

369
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,019
and I'll place this directly over the

370
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,160
center of the circle here I'm going to

371
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
hold shift and select both of these and

372
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm going to Center them up vertically

373
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,220
and horizontally make sure you have

374
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,260
relative two make sure you have that to

375
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,480
last selected and again if you don't

376
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,579
have your outline distribute menu active

377
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,740
you can open it by going to object and

378
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
selecting a line and distribute which is

379
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,720
down here at the bottom of the list

380
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,760
and once that's centered let me deselect

381
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,800
it I'm going to take just this object

382
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
right here and I'm going to hold Ctrl

383
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,100
and shift and just scale this down like

384
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,420
that

385
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,519
and I'm going to change the blend mode

386
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,779
of this one as well let me come back

387
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,279
over here to my fill and stroke menu I'm

388
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,380
going to change the Blends mode to I

389
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
think this one is multiply there we go

390
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,639
yeah now we have multiply and let me

391
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,959
duplicate this again I'm going to right

392
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,880
click this and go to duplicate I'll make

393
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
this one white

394
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,180
and I'll change the blend mode of this

395
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,680
back to normal

396
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,260
and I'll just scale this down like that

397
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,440
and now it looks sort of like a compact

398
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,720
disc and you can change you can adjust

399
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,220
the size of these circles if you want

400
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm just eyeballing this here I don't

401
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,820
know if this accurately represents the

402
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,339
proportions of a CD but that looks close

403
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,440
enough and then finally I'll put one

404
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,959
more circle behind the disk sort of like

405
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,940
as a bevel so I'll take this one here

406
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,519
I'll right click it go to duplicate

407
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
I'll make this one a lighter shade of

408
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
gray maybe 20 percent

409
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,579
I'll scale this up

410
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,019
send it all the way to the back by

411
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,279
clicking this button up here that says

412
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,500
lower to the bottom

413
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,420
and I'll just resize this accordingly

414
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,279
I'll make that a little smaller

415
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,660
and I'll maybe even make that a little

416
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,100
darker just so it stands out a little

417
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,279
more

418
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
and there you go we have used conical

419
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,240
gradients to create that CD design

420
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
so that is how you can work with mesh

421
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,260
gradients and conical gradients in

422
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,459
inkscape

423
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,380
found this lesson useful then consider

424
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,240
checking out my inkscape master class

425
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,459
it's a collection of over 60 videos

426
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,079
where I go over all of the tools and

427
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,120
features in inkscape and I explain what

428
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
they are and demonstrate how they work

429
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
kind of like how I did in this video we

430
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,880
even have a private Community where you

431
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,680
can ask questions and get help from me

432
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,200
anytime you want and best of all there's

433
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,180
no monthly membership fees you just pay

434
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,600
17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

435
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,920
have some information about that down

436
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
below if you want to check that out as

437
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
always thanks for watching

438
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,549
