00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,280
let's go over how you can save an object

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,359
with a transparent background using

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,200
inkscape the first thing you'll want to

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,720
do is create a selection around the

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,280
object you'd like to save so I'm going

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
to click on this grouping of objects

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
right here and for this demonstration

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,639
I'm going to save this icon with a

9
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,079
transparent background once you have

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,920
your selection enabled open up the

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,960
export menu by going to file and

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,359
selecting

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
export from the export menu make sure

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you have the selection tab enabled and

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,519
come down here to this little thumbnail

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,960
preview that shows you a preview of

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
what's going to be saved

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
now if you just want your selection to

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,120
be saved with a transparent background

20
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,960
and nothing else make sure to click this

21
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,399
button right here that says export

22
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,840
selection only and once you do that

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,000
you'll notice the background there

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
changes to a checkerboard pattern

25
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,239
indicating transparency if you don't

26
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,320
have this option selected it's going to

27
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,160
export everything within the bounding

28
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,399
box of the selection here which is what

29
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,960
I don't want so I'm going to enable that

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
again and now to save this I'm going to

31
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,480
click on this folder icon down here to

32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,199
choose a location on my hard drive to

33
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,760
save it to before you do that though

34
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,039
come over here to this drop down and

35
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,920

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,320

38
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,360

39
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,640

41
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,200
