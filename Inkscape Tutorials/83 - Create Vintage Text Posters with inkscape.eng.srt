Inkscape I'm gonna open up a blank

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,489
canvas as you can see here and I just

17
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:36,750
want to make sure that we're all working

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,250
with a similar view before we get

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,510
started so I'm just gonna come up here

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,850
to where it says view make sure you have

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,100
custom selected and then we'll go to

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,730
zoom we're going to zoom in at 1 to 1

23
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,780
and then I'll open up the align and

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,100

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,340

want to make sure you have last selected

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,670
chosen where it says relative too and

31
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,080
once we've done that we're good to get

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,790
started so the first thing we're going

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,650
to create is the actual text so I'm

34
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,930
gonna grab the text tool over here and

35
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,100

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,830
own line so I'm gonna write how for the

39
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,150
first line second line to create and for

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,960
this third line vintage just like I had

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,560
vintage if you saw in the thumbnail of

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,899
the design I had that word over I had it

48
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,939
placed on top of like a banner so I want

49
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,890
to make sure I use a different font for

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,049
this for this word right here I'm gonna

51
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,549
open up the text editor I'm gonna click

52
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,130
on that text and hold ctrl shift T to

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,479
open up the text editor or you just

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,399
click on this T icon up here I like to

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,579
use control shift T cuz it's easier and

56
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,700
the font I'm going to use is called Z a

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,628
B is a zaba Tanna poster I'm gonna go

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,900
description to a poster I have all of

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,830

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,110
use these fonts that I'm using you can

64
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,670

to Center them on the vertical axis and

83
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,520

84
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,590

click off of that to deselect everything

87
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,190
what I want to do now is make each of

88
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,720
these objects the same width

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,700

where it says when lock changed both the

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,840
width and the height by the same

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,940
proportion turn that on I'm gonna right

95
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,550
click that and go to copy and then when

96
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,410
I click on this top word up here and go

97
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,090
to edit paste size paste width and it's

98
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,519
gonna make it the same width as the next

99
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,470
item I'll come down here and do the same

100
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,470
thing edit paste size paste width we're

101
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,670
not going to do this with this middle

102
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,260
word here because this word needs to be

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,670
a little bigger than the others because

104
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,100
this is gonna go on a banner and it'll

105
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,019
do the same thing down here edit paste

106
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,860
size paste with and what I will do now

107
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,350
is I want to put little lines between

108
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,750
these two text items right here so I'm

109
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,709
gonna grab the squares and rectangles

110
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,440
tool and I'll just click and drag to

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,480
create a little rectangle in there let

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,890
me get rid of that stroke by holding

113
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,890

meant to be little access little accent

117
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,320
pieces they don't have to you don't have

118
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,728
to necessarily use these but I think

119
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,530
they make the design just come together

120
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,630
a little more and again I want to make

121
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,130
these I want to make these the same

122
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,300
width so I'll go to edit

123
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,440

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,719
that's a good that's a good thickness

183
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,149
right there now what I want to do is

184
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,500
convert this to a path so I'll go to

185
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,750
path stroke the path

186
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,080
and then paths break apart and then

187
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,050
paths Union and the whole point of that

188
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,670
was to end up with the rectangle just

189
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,830
like this black one here only slightly

190
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,440
thicker on all on both dimensions right

191
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,570
there now what I want to do is take this

192
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,760
black rectangle and duplicate that I'm

193
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,890
gonna click on it then press control D

194
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,900
on the keyboard I'm trying to take this

195
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,280
and move this down to the left over here

196
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,720
like that and I'm gonna send that to the

197
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,330
bottom by pressing end on the keyboard

198
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,030
let me move this down here like this I'm

199
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,970
gonna grab the nodes tool click and drag

200
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,650
over these two these two nodes to the

201
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,840
right right here hold ctrl and just

202
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,220
click and drag these over to the left

203
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,930
like that this is gonna be like the tail

204
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,530
kind of like the tail of the ribbon

205
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,760
right about there is good now I'm gonna

206
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,260
click and drag over those nodes right

207
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,060
there and I want to insert a new node in

208
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,200
the middle so we'll come up here to the

209
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,090
very top left where it says insert new

210
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,580
nodes into selected segments click on

211
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,040
that and then I want to click on just

212
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,860
that new node right there and hold ctrl

213
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,930
and just move this over to the right to

214
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,100
give it kind of like a little bit of a

215
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,550
fish tail for the ends there may be a

216
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,229
little less that's good right there now

217
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,210
let me grab the Select tool again let me

218
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,280
duplicate that by hitting ctrl D on the

219
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,960
keyboard and I will flip that

220
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,380
horizontally and bring this over here to

221
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,840
the top right and I want to send this to

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
the bottom as well I'm gonna press end

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,800
on the keyboard I want to bring this

224
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,860
right about here and then I'll hold

225
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,050
shift and click on the other one so we

226
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,060
have both of these little ribbon tails

227
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,990
selected and I'll go to path Union and

228
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,910
then I'll hold shift and click on this

229
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,850
red rectangle right here and Center it

230
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,979
up on the vertical and horizontal axis

231
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,610
like that and then I'll go to path

232
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,520
difference and there you have our ribbon

233
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,070
so let me take this text these text

234
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,720
objects right here and just hold ctrl

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,990
and move them up a little bit and I'll

236
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,219
do the same thing with these I'll click

237
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,140
and drag over those hold ctrl move these

238
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,599
down a little bit like that and that's

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,250
what I'm looking for right there now

240
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,510
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click and

241
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,420
drag over everything I'm gonna group

242
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,920
them together by clicking the button up

243
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,990
here that says group selected objects or

244
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,000
you could just press ctrl G because I

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
like to do and

246
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,779
I'm going to share it a little bit so

247
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm gonna click on this object again if

248
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,540
you notice here when you have it

249
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,190
selected you have these arrows right

250
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,750
here these are the scaling handles they

251
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,089
allow you to scale an object if I click

252
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,889
on the object its gonna give us the

253
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,779
rotation and the shearing handles which

254
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,610
will allow us to either rotate or shear

255
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,860
the object I want this shearing handle

256
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,420
over here to the right I'm just gonna

257
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,540
click and drag that up a little bit

258
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,800
maybe about that much right there that's

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
pretty good and now it's time to create

260
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,319
kind of like a frame or a border going

261
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,569
around the words here so let me grab the

262
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,089
squares and rectangles tool again I'm

263
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,230
gonna click and drag to create a

264
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,819
rectangle going over all of those words

265
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,699
I want to make this I want to give this

266
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,380
a black outline so I'm gonna hold shift

267
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,569
and click on the color black and I want

268
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,100
it to have no fill so I'm gonna click on

269
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,589
this red X to get rid of a fill color

270
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,790
and I want to make that border a little

271
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,259
thinner I don't want to be that thick

272
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,339
I'm gonna try maybe eight eight pixels

273
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,560
that looks pretty good okay so let me go

274
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,690
back to the Select tool let me convert

275
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,000
that to a path by going to path object

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
to path and then I want to hold shift

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,550
and click on the text objects just to

278
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,290
make sure we have it centered up on this

279
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,540
horizontal and vertical axis like that

280
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,370
now let me click off of that to deselect

281
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,839
everything and click on just this

282
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,639
rectangle right here I'm gonna go back

283
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,699
to the nodes tool the edit pads by nodes

284
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,310
click and drag over these top two nodes

285
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,410
insert a new node in there and do the

286
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,910
same thing down here take those two

287
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,920
nodes and put a new one in there now

288
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,139
what I want to do is grab just those two

289
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,459
nodes right there click and drag over

290
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,920
both of those and up here in the tool

291
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,970
settings you're gonna see show

292
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,740
transformation handles for selected

293
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,319
nodes if I turn that on it's going to

294
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:32,910
give us scaling handles for the nodes

295
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,230
that we have selected which is going to

296
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,089
be useful here which is what I want I'm

297
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,740
gonna hold ctrl and shift and I'm gonna

298
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,259
grab the scaling handle up here and you

299
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,550
just pull this out a little bit if you

300
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,649
notice here we're giving the top and the

301
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,850
bottom a little bit of a tip like that

302
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,350
now I'm going to turn off the scaling

303
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,290
handles show transformation handles for

304
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,120
selective nodes turn that back off so it

305
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,620
doesn't get in your way the next time

306
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,380
you go to use the nodes tool later on

307
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,050
I'm gonna grab the select tool okay that

308
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,100
right there is looking pretty good

309
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,899
that's about what I'm looking for now

310
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,550
what I want to do is put another border

311
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,010
around

312
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,660
outside edge of this border only

313
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,150
slightly thinner so what I'm gonna do is

314
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm gonna duplicate this I'm going to

315
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,290
press control D on the keyboard and I'm

316
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,970
gonna fill this with white and I'm gonna

317
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,380
give this a white outline by holding

318
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,210
shift and clicking the the color of

319
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,420
white and for the width I'll make this

320
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,760
larger I'm gonna go with maybe let's say

321
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,230
twelve see how that looks

322
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,330
and I want to send this to the bottom

323
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,450
lower select objects to the bottom

324
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,340
that's going to act this white border is

325
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,320
gonna act as a buffer between the large

326
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,910
black border and the smaller black

327
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,160
border so let me duplicate that again

328
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,500
control D and I'll make this one black

329
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,660
and give it a black stroke by holding

330
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,000
shift and clicking on black and I'll

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,280
send that to the bottom as well and I'm

332
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,210
gonna want to make this one a little

333
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,810
better a little bigger I'm gonna try 20

334
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,740
okay so that's not quite what I'm

335
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,090
looking for let me zoom in a little bit

336
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,560
you could zoom in and out by holding

337
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
ctrl and rolling up the mouse wheel I'm

338
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,100
gonna take this white one right here I

339
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,290
want this border this gap between the

340
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,640
two borders to be bigger so I'm gonna

341
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,470
make this one maybe 16 maybe 15 and then

342
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,060
I'll take the other at the outer black

343
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,570
border over here and I'll make that I'm

344
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,220
gonna make this a little bigger than 25

345
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,620
looks a little too big

346
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,300
let me try 22 a little bigger I'm just

347
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,770
going to manually adjust that until it

348
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,970
looks about right

349
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,440
that right there is about what I'm

350
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,370
looking for I think that looks pretty

351
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,410
good so now I can click off of

352
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,810
everything I want to zoom in and take

353
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,390
just this outer border right here I want

354
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,950
to go to path stroke to path path break

355
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,210
apart path Union and I'm gonna do the

356
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,100
same thing to the inner white border

357
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,550
right there path stroke the path path

358
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,800
break apart path Union and then hold

359
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,490
shift and click on the outer black

360
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,870
border so that we have both the white

361
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,670
and the black borders selected and go to

362
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,270
path difference now I'm going to click

363
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,340
on the large black border and here the

364
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,450
original one and I'm going to convert

365
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,030
that to a path as well by going to path

366
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,890
stroke the path and then finally I'm

367
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,690
going to hold shift I'm gonna click on

368
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,980
the other border so we have both of

369
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,270
these borders selected and go to path

370
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,940
Union now let me press one on the

371
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,140
keyboard to zoom back out to 100% let me

372
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,760
click off it to deselect everything it's

373
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,140
looking pretty good now it's gonna make

374
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,640
a few minor edits and we'll be all

375
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,170
finished so let me click on the text

376
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,240
objects in here and let me ungroup them

377
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,460
by clicking the button that says ungroup

378
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,200
selected objects or you can press ctrl

379
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,520
shift G like that and what I will do now

380
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,140
is I want to take this border right here

381
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,790
I mean that this border this black

382
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,910
rectangle right here I want to duplicate

383
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,220
that by pressing control D and I want to

384
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,020
make that red and I want to bring the

385
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,700
opacity down in half roughly in half

386
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,130
what I want to do is create a gap in

387
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,720
these borders right here between the

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,460
ribbon and the borders so I'm gonna use

389
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,440
this red rectangle as a reference point

390
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,360
for that so let me grab the nodes tool

391
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
again I'm gonna clicking drag over this

392
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,930
top node then I'll hold your shift click

393
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,270
and drag over this node over here and

394
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,860
I'm gonna hold ctrl and click and drag

395
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,670
that up that's what about there that

396
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,300
looks good

397
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,410
I'll do the same thing down here

398
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,690
clicking drag over this node hold shift

399
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,250
click and drag over that node and then

400
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,890
hold control and move this one down to

401
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,650
about there so that is sticking out just

402
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,090
a little bit further than the black

403
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,370
ribbon beneath it then I'll grab the

404
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,770
Select tool hold shift click on your

405
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,850
border right there and go to path

406
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,830
difference and that right there was the

407
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,970
point of that I wanted to create that

408
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,890
gap between the poor and the ribbon

409
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,590
right there so the next step is I want

410
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,660
to add a little bit of a little bit of

411
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,130
an accent piece right here in the

412
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,810
corners of the top and the bottom so to

413
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,640
do that first what I want to do is

414
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,990
enable snapping I'm gonna come up here

415
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,430
to where it says enable snapping turn

416
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,200
that on and we're gonna want to make

417
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,730
sure we have this one selected it says

418
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,520
snap custom nodes and this was well snap

419
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,920
snaps smooth nodes and I'm going to take

420
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,390
this border right here and I'm gonna

421
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,700
duplicate that by hitting ctrl D on the

422
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,190
keyboard and I'm gonna make this red and

423
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,050
I'm gonna bring the opacity down in half

424
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,670
now it's gonna click and drag and move

425
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,620
this up I'm gonna snap this piece I'm

426
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,870
gonna snap the bottom corner into the

427
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,610
top corner of the original one right

428
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,190
there and I want to take this red area

429
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,600
what that's sticking out I want to use

430
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,130
that as the accent piece so let me grab

431
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,190
the Bezier pen which is over here or you

432
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,960
could press B on the keyboard

433
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,880
and I'm gonna start a line going right

434
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,160
here in the middle of the black border

435
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,270
come over here through here like this

436
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,110
oops we go through here then here then

437
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,970
back to the starting point

438
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,550
grab the Select tool hold shift on the

439
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,230
keyboard and click on the red object and

440
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,380
go to the path intersection and that's

441
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,640
what I'm looking for right there now I

442
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,620
want to duplicate that by hitting ctrl D

443
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,950
I want to flip that vertically and I

444
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,510
want to click and drag this down here

445
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,930
and then snap this onto there like that

446
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,910
now let me zoom out a little bit again

447
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,350
I'm holding ctrl and rolling down the

448
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,750
mouse wheel to zoom I'm gonna hold your

449
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,610
shift click on that red object so we

450
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,950
have both red objects selected and then

451
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm gonna hold shift and click on them

452
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,400
on the border and go to path Union and

453
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,460
now I'll go to path break apart so that

454
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,020
everything is an individual piece now

455
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,070
and the whole point of that as you can

456
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,660
see here is to create this little indent

457
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,580
just a nice little accent piece for the

458
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,540
design so the final step I would say

459
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,000
would be to add the texture but first I

460
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,980
want to add a little bit of color so let

461
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,890
me uh first let me click and drag over

462
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,060
everything and go to path object to path

463
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,710
and that's going to take that text and

464
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,450
change it from text objects to actual

465
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,760
pads that we can work with now I want to

466
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,260
click off of it to deselect I want to

467
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,790
take just this word vintage right here I

468
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,880
want to ungroup it unify it together by

469
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,730
going to path Union and then hold shift

470
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,770
and click on the banner underneath it

471
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,500
and go to path difference and what that

472
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,300
did was it pretty much just used the

473
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,520
text as a reference to punch negative

474
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,959
space punch a hole through the ribbon

475
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,640
there so that I can change the colors

476
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,560
and do whatever I want to it and as you

477
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,569
can see it's kind of like a negative

478
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,780
space between there in those words so

479
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,609
now that I've done that I want to give

480
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,839
this thing some color I'm gonna click

481
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,730
and drag over all of it I'm gonna give

482
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,069
this like a little royal blue or like a

483
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,800
dark navy blue something like that

484
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,170
that's pretty good I want to take this

485
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,700
word I actually want to take this piece

486
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,740
right here and make this a shade of gold

487
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,300
obviously you can color this and however

488
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,350
you'd like you don't have to use the

489
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,270
colors I'm using here

490
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm gonna go the fill tab up here under

491
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,260
the HSL tab I'm gonna take the

492
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,760
saturation just bring that down a little

493
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,950
bit you bring this up a little bit as

494
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,310
well I want to do the same thing I want

495
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,960
to hold shift and click on both the word

496
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,510
text and this accent piece right here I

497
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,510
want to grab the dropper tool and make

498
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,760
that the same color as this there we go

499
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,740
and I want to take let me grab the nodes

500
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,750
tool I'm gonna click on just the word

501
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,030
create here and click on that hold shift

502
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,980
click on that each letter individually

503
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,800
so that we have them all selected go

504
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,930
back to the Select tool and then grab

505
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,820
the dropper and make that the same color

506
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,130
right there and then finally I want to

507
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,380
take the outer border right here and I

508
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,760
want to make that the same color as the

509
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,040
gold so let me select those both grab

510
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,100
the dropper over here or you can press D

511
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,350
on the keyboard that's also another way

512
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,530
to grab it grab the Select tool press 1

513
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,330
on the keyboard to zoom back out to 100%

514
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,640
and what I'm going to do now is just

515
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,990
click and drag over all of this and

516
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,410
group this together ctrl G to group it

517
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,230
together let me turn off the snapping

518
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,520
for now because that's just gonna get in

519
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,250
our way the final step is to add a

520
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,930
little bit of a texture on here to make

521
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,990
it look worn aged and again I'll have a

522
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,340
link in the description of the video to

523
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,260
a to a page with all of the resources

524
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,510
including this texture what I'm going to

525
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,100
do is once you have the texture hoping

526
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm gonna bring my folder over here just

527
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,190
so you can see I have my folder over

528
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,590
here I'm gonna take the I'm gonna take

529
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,080
the texture grunge texture dot PNG and

530
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,370
just click and drag it into Inkscape

531
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,410
like that and just leave this little

532
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,390
window that pops up just leave all the

533
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,250
defaults there go ahead and click OK and

534
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,440
there you have the texture let me zoom

535
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,600
out a little bit so you can see this let

536
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
me bring the opacity of that down

537
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,010
roughly in half so we can see what's on

538
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,870
there as well so what I want to do is

539
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,180
place this texture over the image right

540
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,670
here I'm gonna hold ctrl + shift and

541
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,220
scale this down a little bit now if you

542
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,660
notice where the black areas of the

543
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,980
textures are like this is the black

544
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,040
scratch marks when I apply this texture

545
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,500
to this design all of those black

546
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,660
scratches are gonna represent negative

547
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,190
space in the design so all of those

548
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,480
black scratches are going to become

549
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,730
white or negative space within that

550
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,840
design you'll see what I mean when I

551
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,230
apply the

552
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,330
texture so I'm telling you that so you

553
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,309
can you could try to figure out where

554
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,290
exactly you want the texture to be

555
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,850
because like if you take this area right

556
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,320
here which is all black and place it

557
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,299
over here it's gonna punch out a big

558
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,710
area of the design that's not going to

559
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,960
be legible so I like to make sure I not

560
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm not using too much of the texture

561
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,549
over the design maybe something subtle

562
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,860
like that now I'll click and drag over

563
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,380
both of those bring the opacity all the

564
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,480
way up and go to object mask set and

565
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,309
there you go I'd say that looks pretty

566
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,990
good so I think that should do it for

567
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,220
this tutorial that's how you can go

568
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,860
about creating a vintage style text

569
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,080
poster using Inkscape if you have any

570
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,549
questions let me know and as always

571
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:39,380
thanks for watching
