00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,400
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,510
in today's tutorial I'll be

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,070
demonstrating how you can create these

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,160
double exposure logos using Inkscape and

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,449
if you'd like to learn more about how

7
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,100
Inkscape works be sure to check out the

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,570
Inkscape master class which is a

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,789
collection of over 50 videos where I go

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,410
over all of the tools and features in

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,000
Inkscape and I explain what they are and

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,080
demonstrate how they work

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,490
I'll put a link in the description if

14
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,230
you want to check that out so I'm gonna

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,610
get started here in Inkscape the first

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,870
thing we want to do is just set up our

17
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,160
documents that we're all working with

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,899
this similar workflow I'm gonna come up

19
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,280
here where it says view and I want to

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,810
make sure we have custom selected and

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,450
then I'll zoom go to zoom zoom in at 1

22
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,700
to 1 and then I want to open up the

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,960
align and distribute menu with this

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,790
button over here we're gonna want last

25
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,530
selected chosen from that drop-down and

26
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,210
then I'll open up the Edit objects

27
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,860
colors gradients and Stroke menu with

28
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,510
this button right here so that we have

29
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,340
those two menus open now what we're

30
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,510
gonna do is we're going to import some

31
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,760
graphics from from pixabay which is like

32
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,739
a free stock photo site with a double

33
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,899
exposure logo you're pretty much doing

34
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,339
is you're taking two different objects

35
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:05,630
and combining them together into one

36
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,770
object now let me show you what I mean

37
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,869
here I'm gonna open up this website here

38
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,010
I'll have a link to all of this

39
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,810
information in the description of the

40
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,670
video I'm gonna take a combination of

41
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,610
this like this silhouette of a skyline

42
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,190
of trees here and combine it with one of

43
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,990
these animals here for the thumbnail I

44
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,520
use the bear that's what I'll be using

45
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,040
in this tutorial so what I'm gonna do is

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm going to download this click on free

47
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,740
download I'm gonna choose the vector

48
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,640
graphic the SVG download that let me

49
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,810
minimize this and just click and drag

50
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,330
this into Inkscape there we go and I

51
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,350
want to come over here and do the same

52
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,100
thing download this the SVG download

53
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,259
there we go

54
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,700
click and drag that into Inkscape and

55
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,770
there we go now let me open up Inkscape

56
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,840
again let me zoom out a little bit I'm

57
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,310
gonna hold ctrl and roll down the mouse

58
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,560
wheel a few times to zoom out I want to

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,119
take this over here let me try

60
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,500
ungrouping this is seeing if I could

61
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,020
there we go just take this I'm gonna

62
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,149
work with this one with this one animal

63
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,380
right here and I take the rest of these

64
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,759
and press Delete on the keyboard to get

65
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,460
rid of them and what I'm gonna do is I'm

66
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,229
gonna take these objects and make them

67
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,340
different colors and bring the opacity

68
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,079
down so I can see them a little better

69
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,609
okay so I'm gonna start off with this

70
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,749
object right here I'm gonna make this

71
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:17,540
red bring me the opacity down roughly

72
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:17,830
and

73
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,840
and then I'll take the bear I'm gonna

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,550
make this blue and I'll bring the

75
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,230
opacity of that down roughly in half as

76
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,700
well and I'm gonna flick this

77
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
horizontally actually enough where it

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
says up here flip selected objects

79
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,830
horizontally I'm gonna flip that over

80
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,930
there and I'm trying to position the

81
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,640
bear over the area of the trees where

82
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,690
I'd like to combine it and I'm gonna

83
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,580
zoom in a little bit by holding ctrl and

84
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,260
rolling up the mouse wheel if you want

85
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,550
to move the page around you just press

86
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,780
down the mouse-wheel and move the mouse

87
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm just gonna hold ctrl and scale this

88
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,580
up a little bit I want to grab a sample

89
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,210
basically what I'm going to do is I'm

90
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,370
gonna take the bear and the trees and

91
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,100
I'm gonna do a path intersection between

92
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,450
the two of them and it's gonna create an

93
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,430
object that combines the two of these

94
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,140
shapes right here but when I do that

95
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,150
it's gonna cut out the tops of the trees

96
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,160
here because that's extending further

97
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,200
than where the bear is but I want to

98
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
include those trees in this design so

99
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
what I'm gonna do first is I'm gonna

100
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,530
grab it the Bezier pen which is over

101
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,600
here you can just press B on the

102
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,310
keyboard it's a keyboard shortcut and

103
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm gonna manually create a shape going

104
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,209
around the tops of these trees here and

105
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,140
I'm gonna unify it with the bear so let

106
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,120
me start out right over here I'm gonna

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,769
click to create a shape going around the

108
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,769
outside around here let me zoom in a

109
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,910
little bit so I can see this a little

110
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,300
better right over here there we go is

111
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,400
zoom out bring it straight through the

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
object and back to the starting point

113
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,269
like that now what I'm gonna do is go to

114
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,340
the Select tool I'm gonna hold shift I'm

115
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,810
gonna click on the bear graphic with

116
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,120
them both selected I'll go to path Union

117
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,000
and now I will hold shift and click on

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
the trees so that I have both of those

119
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,370
objects selected and I will go to path

120
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,300
intersection you may have to give this a

121
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,950
second to process because it's a pretty

122
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,080
uh it's a large photo here it looks like

123
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
it didn't work for this one

124
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,890
let me des elect it there might be this

125
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,200
actually might be a group of images so

126
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,470
let me try ungrouping this you see if

127
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,550
that helps oh there we go

128
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,620
it was grouped that's why let me bring

129
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,739
the opacity down let me click off of the

130
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,779
graphic to deselect everything and start

131
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,978
off with this again

132
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,500
click on this hold shift click on this

133
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,520
go to path intersection give it a second

134
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,590
and do its thing and there we go as you

135
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,180
can see we have a combination of those

136
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,680
two objects there then let me bring the

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,400
opacity of this all the way up

138
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,320
let me make this black or dark gray and

139
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
and from here on out you can just go

140
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,590
ahead and add your test your text and

141
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,180
whatever else you'd like to add and that

142
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,380
should pretty much do it for this

143
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,460
tutorial that's how you can go about

144
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,470
creating those double exposure style

145
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,540
logos using Inkscape if you have any

146
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,979
questions let me know and as always

147
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,200
thanks for watching

148
