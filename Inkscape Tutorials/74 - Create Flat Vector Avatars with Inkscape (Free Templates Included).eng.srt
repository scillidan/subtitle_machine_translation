00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,719
you can create these flat style vector

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,679
avatars

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,440
using inkscape and if you'd like to

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,039
learn more about how inkscape works be

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,640
sure to check out my inkscape master

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
class it's a collection of over 60

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,039
videos

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,720
where i go over every tool and feature

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
in inkscape and i explain what it is and

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,920
demonstrate how it works

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,279
i'll put a link in the description of

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
the video if you want to check that out

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
so we'll get started here in escape the

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
first thing we want to do is just set up

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,320
our documents that we're all working

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
with a similar view

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,559
i just want to come up here to where it

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,239
says view make sure we have custom

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,200
selected

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
we'll come over here to zoom make sure

24
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
you zoom in at one to one

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,239
and then i'm going to open up the align

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,600
and distribute menu with this button

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
over here or you could just press

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,320
ctrl shift and a as you can see here

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,680
where it says relative to we're going to

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
want to have this set to last selected

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,840
and then i'll open up the fill and

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
stroke menu which is over here or you

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
can just press ctrl

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
shift and f and we'll have that open as

35
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
you can see there

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
so to get us started basically what

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
we're going to be doing is we're just

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
going to be using really basic common

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
shapes in inkscape to put together

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
avatars or faces and

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
i'll just do one as an example here i'm

42
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
going to grab the squares and rectangles

43
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
tool right here

44
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
and i'm going to click and drag to

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
create a rectangle like that a little

46
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
longer in height a little larger in

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,799
height than it is in width

48
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
because this is going to represent our

49
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,560
avatar's head and up here this little

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,159
note at the top right this little

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,280
circular note i'm just going to bring

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
that down like that to give this rounded

53
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,479
corners

54
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
and i'll give this a color just to color

55
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
in the face here maybe like a shade of

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
orange or something like that

57
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,439
over here in the fill tab under the hsl

58
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,799
tab i'm just going to adjust the color a

59
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
little bit maybe

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
give it a little more vibrance like that

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,799
there we go that looks pretty good and

62
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,079
now that represents that's going to

63
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,280
represent the head i'm going to put some

64
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
eyes on here now so let me grab the

65
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
circle tool and i'm going to hold ctrl

66
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
and shift so that it makes a

67
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
perfectly round circle like that and

68
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
just click and drag there we go

69
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
i'll make the eyes black or a dark shade

70
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
of gray like that

71
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,000

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679

another rectangle right in the center

77
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,280
here which is going to represent the

78
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560

on the head and i'm going to take these

97
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,280
two circles the eyes hold

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
on the uh horizontal axis like that or

104
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
the vertical axis rather

105
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
now let me click off of that to deselect

106
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400

and scale them up a little bit

110
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
you may have to scale them up or down

111
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
depending on how big or

112
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
small you made them so just go ahead and

113
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
manually adjust it as you see fit

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,959
and what i'll do now is i'll just put

149
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,358

centered up like that

160
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,759
i might want to take these eyes and nose

161
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,520
and move them up a little bit

162
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
i'm going to put another rectangle right

create a rectangle like that we're going

178
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
to want square corners in this rectangle

179
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,240
so i'm going to click this button up

180
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
here

to make sure the corner is sharp like

182
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
that

triple click that and then just hit ctrl

187
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
v to paste the height in there like that

188
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
that's what i'm looking for i'm going to

189
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
make that white

190
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
to represent teeth maybe make that a

191
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
little smaller

192
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
i'm going to hold shift click on the

193
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
mouth group those two together

194
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,400
with the group button up here oops

195
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,960
there we go let me make that a little

196
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
smaller again make sure we have it

197
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
centered up it looks like it already is

198
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
and what i'm going to do now is i'm

199
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,919
going to add some ears to the sides of

200
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,360
the head here

201
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
now if you see me scrolling um you see

202
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
me zooming in and out like this you

203
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
could just hold ctrl

204
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,199
and roll up and down your mouse wheel to

205
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
zoom in and out and to move around the

206
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
page you can just press down the mouse

207
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
wheel and move around the mouse

208
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,759
so let me grab the circles and ellipses

209
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,360
tool i'm going to hold ctrl and shift to

210
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
create another ellipse or a circle

211
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,479
rather like this

212
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,080
i want to make this the same color as

213
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
the skin tone here so i'm going to grab

214
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,520
the dropper tool

215
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
over here and make that the same color

216
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
now i want this to be positioned beneath

217
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
the head so i'm going to come up here to

218
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
where it says

219
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
lower selection to the bottom and click

220
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
on that and let me just turn off

221
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
snapping for the time being because that

222
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
may get in the way of where i want to

223
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,680
position

224
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
the uh the ears here so let me bring

225
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
this over like that

226
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
i'm going to hold ctrl and shift and

227
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
scale that down it looks a little too

228
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
a little too big position that right

229
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,319
about there

230
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
now i'm going to create a a duplicate of

231
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,240
this circle by pressing control d

232
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
and i'm going to make it the same color

233
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
as the nose right here so again we're

234
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
going to grab the dropper

235
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,919
go like that there we go now i'm going

236
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,280
to lower this down i'm going to lower

237
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,639
this one step

238
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
lower this another step so that it goes

239
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
beneath the head there

240
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
and to do that i'm pushing this button

241
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
right here lower selection one step

242
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
i'm going to hold ctrl and shift scale

243
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,319
that down

244
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
and that right there is what i'm looking

245
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
for so i'll hold shift now

246
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
and click on both of these circles so i

247
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
have them both selected and i'll group

248
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,319
them together

249
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,560
group selected objects and now i want to

250
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
duplicate them because i'm going to

251
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
use them for the other ear over here so

252
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,199
instead of right clicking and going to

253
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,800
duplicate i'm just going to press ctrl

254
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
d on the keyboard to duplicate it and

255
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
then i'll hold ctrl and just click and

256
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
drag this over to the right side like

257
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
that

258
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
and i'm going to lower them to the

259
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,199
bottom maybe i'll move this over a

260
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,800
little closer like that

261
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
i want to hold shift and click on the

262
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
other ear over here i want both sets of

263
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,360
ears selected

264
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
and i want to group them together and

265
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
then hold shift and click on the head

266
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
and center that up on the vertical axis

267
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
like that now let me zoom out a little

268
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
bit so i can see how this is coming out

269
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
it's looking pretty good one thing i

270
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,879
want to do is make the head a little

271
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
more elongated so let me convert

272
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
this to a path i'm going to go to path

273
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
object to path

274
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
and now i'm going to go to the edit

275
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
paths by nodes tool i'm going to click

276
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
and drag over this top portion of nodes

277
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
over here

278
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
and just hold ctrl and move them up like

279
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,000
there because we're going to put some

280
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
hair

281
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
over the head here and i want to make

282
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
sure i have more room to work with

283
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
so let me grab this select tool what i'm

284
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
going to do now is i'm going to create

285
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
some hair for our avatar here so

286
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
to do this i'm going to create an offset

287
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
of the head here so i'm going to go to

288
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,879
with this

289
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,680
head selected i'll go to path linked

290
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,800
offset

291
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,160
and that's going to create a copy of it

292
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
and the copy is going to be located

293
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,840
behind

294
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
the head so let me just come over here

295
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,879
and pick a color for the hair i'm going

296
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,520
to go with

297
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
like this shade of brown over here

298
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
you're not going to see it change colors

299
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,120
on your screen because it's positioned

300
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
behind the head but once you've done

301
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,599
that you can take this little node and

302
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,799
pull that out

303
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,880
and you'll notice it's coming out like

304
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
that now let me finalize that by

305
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,880
converting it to a path we'll go to path

306
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,679
object to path and i want to grab the

307
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
select tool

308
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,480
and lower this to the bottom so it goes

309
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
beneath the ears and now i just want to

310
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,959
cut off

311
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,920
the portion of the hair that is below

312
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
the ears so let me grab the bezier pen

313
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,839
again

314
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
i'm going to start right about here

315
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
click to create a point hold ctrl bring

316
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
the line straight through like that

317
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,279
create another point now we can just let

318
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
go of control and finish the shape

319
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
around the outside like that

320
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
grab the select tool hold shift click on

321
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
the object there and go to

322
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,839
path difference and there we go now we

323
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,800
have

324
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,160
the sides of the hair anyway i'm going

325
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
to add some hair to the top up here

326
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
so to do that i'm going to grab the

327
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
rectangle tool again and i'm just going

328
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
to create a rectangle over the top here

329
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
to create some hair to put on top of the

330
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
head

331
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
i'll position this right about here and

332
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
i'm going to make this shade a little

333
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
lighter

334
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
just to add a little bit of depth to the

335
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
design here and what i want to do now is

336
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
i want to leave this corner

337
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
sharp but i want to make these three

338
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
corners rounded and to do that i'm going

339
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
to use a

340
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
live path effect called fillet and

341
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
chamfer

342
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
so let me first convert this to a path

343
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,080
i'll go to path

344
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
object to path now i want to open up the

345
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
path effects menu so i'll go to path

346
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
grab the path effects menu and right

347
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
here where it says plus

348
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
click on plus to add a new path effect

349
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,200
and the one i'm looking for is corners

350
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
or the fillet and chamfer path effect

351
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,399
click on that

352
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
and down here where it says change only

353
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
selected nodes make sure you click on

354
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
that to have that box text

355
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,880
and i'm going to grab the edit pads by

356
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
nodes tool

357
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
and i'm going to click and drag over

358
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
this node on the top left then hold

359
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
shift click on this click and drag over

360
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
that node on the bottom left

361
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
and then again hold shift and take this

362
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
node over here on the bottom right

363
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
so that we only have these three nodes

364
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
selected because i want to make these

365
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,519
three corners rounded

366
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,760
now where it says radius i'm just going

367
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
to click this little plus icon and

368
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,160
you're going to notice

369
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
it rounds the corners it rounds those

370
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
corners as we do that while leaving this

371
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,720
corner sharp

372
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
that right there is what i'm looking for

373
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
so let me let me finalize that by going

374
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
to path

375
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,240
object to path i can now close out of

376
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
the path effects menu we don't need that

377
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
anymore

378
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
place that right about there this is

379
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
starting to come together now

380
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
one final thing i want to do is just add

381
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
a little bit of a a little bit of an

382
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
accent piece right here to make it look

383
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
like um like light is reflecting off the

384
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
hair so i'm going to take this

385
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
object i'm going to duplicate it by

386
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
pressing ctrl d

387
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
and then i'm going to hold shift and

388
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
click on this one of these lighter

389
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
shades down here for the for the color

390
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
we originally used for the hair

391
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
to give that an outline otherwise known

392
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
as a stroke now let me remove

393
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,200
the fill color from this object i'm

394
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
going to click this little red x over

395
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
here to the bottom left

396
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,920
and i'm going to hold ctrl and shift and

397
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
scale this down a little bit like that i

398
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,440
just want to position this right about

399
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,839
here

400
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
i just want to take a sample of this

401
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
line right here i don't want the

402
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,079
entirety of this line

403
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,360
if you want to come over if you want you

404
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
can come over here to the stroke style

405
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,959
tab to adjust the thickness of this line

406
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,440
yours

407
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
the thickness of your line may vary

408
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
depending on what you most recently used

409
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,839
so

410
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
i'm going to make this a little thicker

411
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,639
and now i just like i said i just want

412
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,000
to grab a sample of this line i don't

413
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
want the entire line so i'm going to

414
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,480
grab the bezier pen click to create a

415
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
point hold ctrl bring this straight

416
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,639
through

417
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,639
like that then bring this straight

418
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,760
through like that

419
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
back to the starting point grab the

420
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
select tool

421
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,839
hold shift click on the object and go to

422
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,959
path

423
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
cut path and that's going to slice that

424
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
into two individual pieces so let me

425
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
click off of that

426
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
and take just this object and just get

427
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,680
rid of that by pressing delete on the

428
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,639
keyboard

429
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
and now we have this i'm going to go

430
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
come over here to where it says stroke

431
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
paint and i'm going to adjust the color

432
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
of that a little bit

433
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,839
make that little there we go just a

434
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,079
little lighter than the hair over here

435
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
so if we zoom out you can see we're

436
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
pretty much done we have created our

437
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,920
vector

438
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
