1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,979
let's go over how you can invert the

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,040
colors of an object using inkscape on my

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,540
screen here I have this example design

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
that I downloaded that consists of a

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,559
grouping of vector objects for this

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,820
demonstration I'm going to create a

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,380
duplicate of this design here by

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,759
pressing Ctrl D and I'm going to move

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,740
this over to the right here just so I

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,660
have something to compare the end result

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,279
to

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,260
so when you invert the colors of objects

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
what happens is you're taking a color

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,500
and swapping it out with the color that

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,180
opposes it on the color wheel

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
so every instance of blue will become

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
orange orange will become blue yellow

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,620
will become purple so on and so forth

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,540
so to accomplish this in inkscape the

20
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,920
first thing you'll want to do is select

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,780
your object or objects you can use

22
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,760
multiple objects if you'd like and with

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,559
them selected come up here to where it

24
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,760
says filters

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,960
go to color and select invert

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,640
and once you do that you will get this

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,379
invert menu with some settings that you

28
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,340
can apply

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,899
so the first thing we'll want to do is

30
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,879
turn on the live preview so we can see

31
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,860
the changes as they're happening and if

32
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,059
you look just above that you'll see

33
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,039
these three options right here the first

34
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,099
one is invert Hue if I select that and

35
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,840
inverts all of the colors as you can see

36
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,760
there but if you notice the eyes which

37
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,860
are white or lighter in color they don't

38
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,619
change they remain a light shade this is

39
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,240
because we don't have invert lightness

40
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
selected so if I if I select invert

41
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,360
lightness

42
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
it inverts the lighter tones as well so

43
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,080
that you get more of this photo negative

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
effect and then finally down here what

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,580
invert transparency does is you won't

46
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,380
see it on this example but if you're

47
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,939
working with the graphic that has areas

48
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,100
of partial transparency it'll just

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,439
invert that so for example if it's 80

50
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,860
opaque it'll become 20 opaque

51
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,659
so let me undo this

52
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,400
let me undo the invert lightness because

53
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,380
I think for this demonstration it looks

54
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,240
better like that and if you come up here

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,700
we have this light transparency slider

56
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
which allows you to add lightness to the

57
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,939
design if necessary

58
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,560
this can be useful sometimes because

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,180
when you invert colors sometimes you get

60
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,799
really dark results this can help you

61
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,079
lighten things up a bit this example

62
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,759
looks good with it not applied so I'm

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,500
going to keep it down to zero and then

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,899
finally up here you can choose to invert

65
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,840
colors by the channels so by default we

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,639
have no inversion but if I invert by the

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,020
red and blue Channel

68
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,300
you get this effect right here and if I

69
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,800
toggle the hue

70
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,239
you can see we end up with that effect

71
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,739
right there

72
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,720
so let's try and invert by the red and

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,940
green channels now we get something like

74
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,840
that

75
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
and without the Hue applied

76
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,620
it looks like that

77
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,540
and then finally we have green and blue

78
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,239
that looks like that and without the Hue

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,739
you end up with something like that

80
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,180
right there so that's something you

81
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,500
could play around with we can get all of

82
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,060
these different results here just like

83
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,040
that so I liked my results best with no

84
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,300
inversion like that and I'm going to

85
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
click apply

86
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,420
and then I click close

87
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,920
and there you go that is how you can

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
invert the colors of an object using

89
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,239
inkscape now one last thing I'd like to

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,800
point out before I end this video is

91
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,599
that when you apply this filter you're

92
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,580
not actually changing the colors of the

93
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,019
objects you're just changing the color

94
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,180
of their appearance on your screen now

95
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,680
if I click on this object right here

96
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,140
this right here is the inverted copy and

97
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,480
this over here is the original copy with

98
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,160
this object selected you can see here

99
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,260
this is a light shade of lavender but if

100
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,700
you look down here in the color status

101
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,340
bar it's still its original color as you

102
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,540
can see over here that's how it's

103
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,640
registering because this is just a

104
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
temporary filter that's applied to the

105
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,459
object

106
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,019
now if you're going to be taking your

107
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,360
design and exporting it as a JPEG or a

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,340
PNG then you can ignore this part of the

109
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,780
video because this doesn't really apply

110
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,879
here but if you're going to take the SVG

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,620
file and try to open it in another

112
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,140
application such as qriket design space

113
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,599
or illustrator this effect is not going

114
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,099
to carry over because this is an

115
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,200
inkscape specific effect you're going to

116
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
end up with this right here

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
so if you truly want your colors to be

118
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,080
inverted what you'll want to do is take

119
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,720
an original copy and swap out and change

120
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,060
the colors manually one by one so if I

121
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,980
select this object I can come over here

122
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,780
to my dropper tool and select that area

123
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,840
and now it is the desired color as you

124
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,980
can see there

125
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,360
so I'll do the same thing I'm going to

126
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,920
click on the nose now and do the same

127
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
thing I'm just going to use the keyboard

128
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,340
shortcuts to toggle between the tools

129
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,680
for the dropper the keyboard shortcut is

130
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,580
d

131
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,680
and I'll click on that and then I'll

132
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,180
switch back to the selection tool which

133
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,620
is s and I'll do the same thing over

134
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,480
here switch back and forth between D and

135
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,319
S

136
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,879
and you could just go through here one

137
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
by one and change all of these colors

138
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
like that

139
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,979
and there you go now we have a copy that

140
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,080
has colors that are truly inverted and

141
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,820
then we have this filtered copy over

142
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,500
here now if you want to remove the

143
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,060
filter at any time you could just select

144
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,979
the objects and come up here to where it

145
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,479
says filters and go down to where it

146
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,940
says remove filters and now it's back to

147
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,560
how it was previously

148
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
so that's how you can work with color

149
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
inversion in inkscape if you found this

150
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,500
lesson useful then consider checking out

151
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,840
my inkscape master class it's a

152
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,699
collection of over 60 videos where I go

153
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,199
over all of the tools and features in

154
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,419
inkscape and I explain what they are and

155
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,100
demonstrate how they work kind of like

156
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
how I did in this video we even have a

157
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,940
private Community where you can ask

158
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,040
questions and get help from me anytime

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,139
you want and best of all there's no

160
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,320
monthly membership fees you just pay 17

161
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,300
one time and you're in for Life I'll

162
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
have some information about that down

163
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,240
below if you want to check that out as

164
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,040
