00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,320
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,969
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,949
how you can use a drawing tablet with

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,539
Inkscape and if you'd like to learn more

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,310
about how Inkscape works be sure to

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,320
check out my Inkscape masterclass it's a

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,210
collection of over 50 videos where I go

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,010
over every single tool and feature in

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,840
Inkscape and I explain what it is and

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,700
demonstrate how it works I'll have a

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,050
link in the description of the video if

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,420
you want to check that out so to get us

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,800
started here as you can see I have

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,750
Inkscape opened up on my screen and I

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,820
have my drawing tablet here on my desk

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,770
and the way that a drawing tablet works

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,210
is that it basically allows you to

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,790
create freehand digital art the same way

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,410
you would with the pencil and paper and

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,660
the tablet I'm using here is a Wacom

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,010
Intuos I'll have a link in the

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,690
description to a short review I wrote

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,980
about it last year in case you're

24
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,320
interested the way that this works is

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
that you plug it in through a USB Drive

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
and if you're using Windows 10 it should

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,350
be automatically recognized and

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,579
functional without having to install

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,130
anything that was the case for me anyway

30
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,780
if that doesn't work for you then you'll

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,579
probably have to install some drivers

32
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,469
depending on your operating system I'll

33
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,060
have a link in the description for those

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,590
as well if you need to download them and

35
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,630
once you have your tablet installed it

36
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,639
basically functions the same way a mouse

37
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,020
would let me show you what I mean here

38
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,639
I'm gonna take the tip of the pen and

39
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,560
hover it above the surface of the tablet

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,209
right here and if you notice as I move

41
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,729
it around it moves the cursor on this

42
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,770
screen as well and if you notice I'm not

43
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,479
actually touching the surface of a

44
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,670
tablet once I do touch the surface of

45
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,859
the tablet it registers the same way it

46
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,240
would is if you were to click and drag

47
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,130
with your mouse and by the way this

48
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,779
works system-wide you don't just have to

49
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,549
install this with Inkscape once you have

50
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,349
this installed you can use this with any

51
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,569
of your other applications as well so

52
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,579
this this works it's kind of like

53
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,020
installing fonts where once it's

54
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,060
installed it works it works system-wide

55
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,439
and the way that this works here is that

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,299
the surface area of the tablet is

57
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,999
represented by the perimeter of your

58
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,369
screen so if you bring your if you bring

59
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,319
the pen to the top left portion of the

60
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,109
tablet the cursor is located in the top

61
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,090
left portion of the screen and then down

62
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,069
here to the bottom right so on and so

63
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,869
forth you get the idea now once you have

64
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,538
your tablet installed I would recommend

65
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:10,800
that you go through some of the settings

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
and get them set up first so what you're

67
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,440
wrong what you're gonna want to do is

68
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,640
come over here to where it says search

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,430
and type in Wacom you're looking for a

70
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,090
Wacom tablet property

71
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,939
you click on that and over here you can

72
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,620
just take these buttons on the tablet

73
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,090
and program and to do whatever you want

74
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,590
these are these buttons over here I

75
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,030
don't use them personally but if you

76
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,829
want to you can program that to whatever

77
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,870
you want what I'm paying attention to

78
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,019
mostly is the pen and mapping so first

79
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,549
of all with the pen you can adjust the

80
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,560
sensitivity to the pen or the distance

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,329
between the pen and a tablet with these

82
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,640
settings over here over here you'll

83
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,200
notice you can program the buttons on

84
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,939
the pen if you look at the pen closely I

85
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,079
don't know if you can tell in the video

86
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,969
but there's two buttons on this pen here

87
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,859
there's one down here and one up here

88
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:52,810
and you can program these buttons to do

89
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,370
whatever you want if you click this drop

90
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,480
down over here you can see all the

91
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,799
different things you could program it to

92
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,919
do I programmed it to do a specific

93
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,569
keystroke which is control Z which is

94
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,180
the undo function and I find that useful

95
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,409
because sometimes I'll be drawing

96
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,879
brushstrokes or something and I don't

97
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,870
like how it came out

98
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,639
instead of having to come over to the

99
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,349
keyboard and press control Z I can just

100
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,209
press that button on the pen and undo

101
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,189
that brushstroke so that's really useful

102
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,669
and the other thing over here disabled

103
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,139
this other button I haven't found a use

104
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,489
for it yet so like I just left it

105
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,470
disabled and then finally over here

106
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,729
where it says mapping this is

107
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,379
particularly important if you're using

108
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,019
multiple monitors like I am as you can

109
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,629
see here I have a triple monitor setup

110
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,699
but I have it set up so that this tablet

111
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,799
only works on this Center monitor right

112
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,359
here which is the monitor I'm using for

113
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,019
this video

114
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,620
by default when I first installed when I

115
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,209
first installed this tablet when I first

116
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,489
plugged it in it had all three monitors

117
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,190
indicated here so that when I used the

118
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,650
surface area of the tablet this whole

119
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,540
width of the tablet represented the

120
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,040
entire width of all three of these

121
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,470
monitors but the height stayed the same

122
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,810
this created a distortion of an aspect

123
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,430
ratio of three to one and it was really

124
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,989
difficult to draw I couldn't figure out

125
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,030
why things that I was drawing with the

126
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,769
tablet didn't look right on the screen

127
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,569
like for example if you were to draw a

128
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,519
perfectly round circle on the tablet it

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,129
would be represented by a really

130
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,379
elongated ellipse on the screen here and

131
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
I couldn't figure out why that was and

132
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,560
then eventually I realized it was

133
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,949
because I had I had the surface area of

134
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,690
the tablet mapped to all three monitors

135
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,610
so if you're using multiple monitors

136
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,229
make sure to come over here to the to

137
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,729
the mapping tab and just set it up so

138
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,770
you're just using one monitor here then

139
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,000
we can close out of that and now we're

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,770
good to get started here in Inkscape

141
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,149
there's a few different things you can

142
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,379
do with the drawing tablet here in

143
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,839
Inkscape one thing you can do is you can

144
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,059
come over here to the free hand lines

145
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,039
tool the tutorial I did the other day

146
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,809
about using custom brushes you can use

147
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,369
that another thing you could do is you

148
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,800
can create some calligraphy with the

149
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,569
calligraphy pen over here for this I

150
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,969
like to use the dip pen the width I have

151
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:54,399
set to 37 the thinning set to 10 and

152
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,319
then the rest the defaults are just the

153
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,300
default as they are and then you just

154
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,949
come over to your canvas over here to

155
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,439
your drawing tablet and then just click

156
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,210
and drag like that or actually press

157
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,800
down the pen and move it around to

158
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
create some calligraphy like that and as

159
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,499
you can see it draws it on the screen so

160
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,569
that's one thing you can do with the

161
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,969
drawing tablet in Inkscape another thing

162
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,319
this would be useful for is if you're

163
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,270
creating those line art style logos that

164
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,860
I did in the previous tutorial a couple

165
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,749
years ago it would be really useful for

166
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,069
that sort of thing is where you could

167
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,869
just draw them freehand without having

168
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,459
to do all of that with the with the

169
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,619
mouse and clicking and dragging so I

170
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,089
think that should do it for this

171
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,559
tutorial that's how you can go about

172
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,419
getting yourself set up with a drawing

173
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,490
tablet and Inkscape if you have any

174
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,199
questions leave a comment below and as

175
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,099
always thanks for watching

176
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:49,029
you
