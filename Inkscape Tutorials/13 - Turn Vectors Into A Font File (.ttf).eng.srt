1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,959
in a previous tutorial I demonstrated

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,719
how you can use inkscape to create your

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,920
own Vector letters but in this tutorial

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,439
I'll be demonstrating how you can take

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:09,519
those letters and turn them into a

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
proper font file in ttf format so

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,040
getting us started here in inscape you

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,840
can see I have these simple letters that

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,760
I've designed if I grab my nodes tool

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,119
and zoom in on this you can see how I

11
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,480
created these these are just individual

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,920
paths that I apply to stroke to and I'm

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,760
going to use these letters to create a

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,560
font file uh for this demonstration so

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,640
in order turn these letters into a font

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,280
file we're going to need to download an

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
application called font uh font Forge

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,120
it's a free and open- Source font editor

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,600
that allows you to create your own fonts

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,559
as well so go ahead and download a font

21
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,280
Forge from the link in the description

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,640
launch the application and once you've

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,480
launched font Forge it should look

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,920
something like this so I'm going to

25
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,480
click on this button right here titled

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,600
new so I can create a new font and when

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,079
I do that we're going to get this window

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,199
with all of these individual boxes in it

29
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,039
and these boxes all represent the

30
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,920
individual characters of the font your

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
creating so if you notice we have all of

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
the special characters here we have the

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,319
numbers we have the uppercase letters

34
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,119
the lowercase letters and some

35
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,439
additional special characters down here

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,680
for this demonstration I'm just going to

37
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,320
fill in the upper and lowercase letters

38
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm going to go back into inkscape and

39
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,280
to do this all we have to do is copy and

40
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,439
paste each letter into each individual

41
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,360
each individual box so I'm going to take

42
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,880
the letter a right here I'll right click

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,640
that and go to copy I'll come back over

44
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
here into font Forge and I'm going to

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
select the Box corresponding with the

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,119
letter a and I'm just going to paste

47
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,520
that in there either by right clicking

48
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,360
it and going to paste or you could just

49
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,880
press contrl +v on the keyboard that

50
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,360
paste that in there now if you notice in

51
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
the thumbnail preview there the letter

52
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
is located in the top left of that

53
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,680
preview box there so we're going to

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
adjust that by double clicking on the

55
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,680
letter to open

56
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,759
it and when we open it we're going to

57
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,280
get this editor here sort of like

58
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,680
inkscape it allows you to change the

59
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,000
design if you'd like to it also allows

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,520
you to change the position now the size

61
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,960
of your letter may vary depending on the

62
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
size of the letter in the software here

63
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,799
here if you find that your letter is too

64
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,840
big or too small you can resize it

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,280
manually using the interface here or

66
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
what I would recommend doing is going

67
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,919
back into inkscape and resizing all of

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
the letters at the same time so that

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
each letter is consistent when you

70
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
create your font from it so uh if you

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
size these down one by one you're going

72
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
to have inconsistent weights between the

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,959
letters so I would recommend sizing them

74
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,319
all at once my size here is pretty good

75
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm going to leave it as it is what I am

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
going to do though is I'm going to

77
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
change the position of this letter if

78
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,879
you notice down here this represents the

79
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,360
Baseline of the text and this area down

80
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
here represents the area that goes

81
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
beneath the Baseline so for example if

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
you were creating a lowercase G you

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
would want part of the letter to rest on

84
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,640
the Baseline but you'd want that tail to

85
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,000
dip down under there so to move this I'm

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
just going to click and drag over the

87
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
letter here and I'm going to click and

88
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
drag one of these nodes and I'm going to

89
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,280
hold the shift key and bring this down

90
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,840
until the node snaps onto the Baseline

91
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,319
and now you can see we have all of this

92
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,840
extra space in here I'm going to close

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
that by taking this guide right here and

94
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,319
just bringing this in further and I want

95
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,879
to leave a little bit of space there

96
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,120
because this is going to repres repr the

97
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,080
spacing between each letter so if I were

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
to bring this all the way in there would

99
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,080
be no spacing between the letter a and

100
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,680
the next letter I type I want there to

101
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,519
be some spacing though so I'll put about

102
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,080
that much spacing in there and that

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,799
looks pretty good I can close out of

104
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,120
that and now you can see the letter a is

105
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,000
all set so I'll repeat this process now

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
with the letter B I'll just copy it by

107
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
pressing contrl C come back in here come

108
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,159
back in here press contrl V to paste it

109
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
double click the layer select the letter

110
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
and grab the node and just snap this to

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,239
the bottom again holding shift to lock

112
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,439
it onto the vertical axis there we go

113
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,040
now it snaps I can take this line and

114
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
move this

115
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
in and close out of that and there we go

116
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,560
so what I'm going to do is I'll go

117
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,959
through here and copy and paste all of

118
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,120
these letters in here real quick and

119
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
I'll catch up with you when I'm

120
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
done so one minor thing I wanted to

121
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
point out in regards to letters like a

122
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,239
lowercase G where the tail descends down

123
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
beneath the Baseline to move this letter

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
we want to place the Baseline we want to

125
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
place this part of the letter right here

126
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,959
on the Baseline and we want this part of

127
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,760
the letter to descend send beyond the

128
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,920
Baseline so I'm going to select

129
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,560
everything and instead of clicking and

130
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
dragging the bottom node I'm going to

131
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
take this node right here which is the

132
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,040
node that I'd like to be on the Baseline

133
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,959
and I'll drag it according to that one

134
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,040
again I'll hold shift and then snap that

135
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,879
node onto the Baseline and as you can

136
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,760
see there the letter G now descends

137
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
beneath the Baseline as intended and I

138
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
can move this line back in and we're

139
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
good to

140
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,360
go and for this particular font that I'm

141
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,199
creating I don't have upper and

142
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,240
lowercase variations of these letters I

143
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
just have the lowercase varieties so I'm

144
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,479
just going to copy and paste the

145
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,880
uppercase variety into the lowercase

146
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,639
boxes uh so that they're all the

147
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
same and once you're finished generating

148
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
all of the characters for your font you

149
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,080
can give your font a name by coming up

150
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,280
here to the element menu and choosing

151
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,720
font info now this part's important

152
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
because whatever you enter here is going

153
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
to be the name of your font so if you

154
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
don't want your font to be named

155
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Untitled one just go ahead and change

156
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
that to something else I'm just going to

157
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,080
name this after myself I'll name it Nick

158
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
and uh if if you want you could fill in

159
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
this other metadata down here we have

160
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
all of this other stuff that you can

161
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,639
look through if you'd like I'm just

162
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,960
going to leave these defaults as they

163
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,199
are for this lesson and I'll click

164
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,039
okay and now to generate a font file I'm

165
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,160
going to come up here to where it says

166
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
file and I'm going to select uh generate

167
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
fonts and from this menu you can choose

168
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
where you would like to save your font

169
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,840
file to you can use this dropdown to

170
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,199
choose the font file type I'm just going

171
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,759
to leave the default which is ttf and my

172
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,560
font file is going to be called nick.

173
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,919
ttf and I'm just going to click generate

174
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,160
now when I click generate I'm going to

175
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,440
get these error messages because I

176
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
didn't create a proper font file there's

177
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
a lot of errors with what I created here

178
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm just going to skip past this I'm

179
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,840
going to click

180
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,479
generate and if you open up your files

181
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm going to open this right here you

182
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,160
can see nick. ttf there is my font and

183
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
there is the preview of the font that I

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,479
created and I'll go ahead and install

185
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,880
this and now this font can be used

186
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,199
virtually anywhere in your operating

187
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,759
system not just with inkscape with any

188
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,600
design app that you want any word

189
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
processor in fact I'll reload inkscape

190
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
here just to show you what I mean let me

191
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,280
close out of this and relaunch the

192
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,400
software let me shrink that

193
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
down and I'll just write in some

194
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,199
placeholder text I'll press contr a to

195
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,720
select it all and I'm going to go

196
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
looking for my font here in this list so

197
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm looking for

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
Nick there it is I'll click apply and

199
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,800
there is the font that I've created and

200
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,919
in fact I can go and change this now you

201
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
know what let me try that

202
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
again

203
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
and if I bring out let me let me open

204
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,919
the rulers by pressing controlr and I'll

205
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,199
bring down a horizontal guide if I place

206
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,599
this horizontal guide here you could see

207
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,080
what I was talking about earlier with

208
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,919
the uh the Baseline of the text the

209
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,160
Baseline sits the letters all sit on the

210
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,680
proper Baseline and the letter G and the

211
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
letter Y descend beneath it the same

212
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
with the letter P as well so that is how

213
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
you can go about creating your own font

214
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,280
files using Vector elements if you found

215
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,720
this lesson useful then consider

216
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,199
checking out my inkscape master class

it's a collection of over 60 videos

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
where I go over all of the tools and

219
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
features in inkscape and I explain what

220
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
they are and demonstrate how they work

221
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,560
kind of like how I did in this video we

222
