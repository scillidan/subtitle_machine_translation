00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,960
this is nick with logos by nick.com and

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
in this tutorial i'll be demonstrating

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,799
how you can take an image and use it to

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
trace a vector halftone portrait using

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,000
inkscape so getting us started here in

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,359
inkscape the first thing i want to do is

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,960
just set up the workflow so that we all

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
have a similar setup on our screen i'm

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
going to come up here to where it says

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,119
view

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,400
i want to make sure i have custom

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
selected and then i want to zoom i want

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,960
to go to view zoom and zoom in at one to

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
one

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,600
okay now what i'm going to do is i'm

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
going to import my example photo so i

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
have over here my other my other monitor

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
i have my example photo i'm going to

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
click and drag that file into inkscape

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
i'm going to leave the defaults as they

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
are and click ok and there we go there

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
is the example photo i will be using for

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,160
this tutorial this is just a stock photo

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
that i grabbed off the internet i'll

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
have a link in the description of the

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
video if you want to use this image

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
otherwise you can use whatever image

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,879
you'd like

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
so the first thing we have to do is make

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
this image black and white so i'm going

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,079
to make sure i have the image selected

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,280
and i'll come up here to where it says

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
filters and i'll come over to color and

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
i'm looking for grayscale

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
now i'm going to take this menu i'm

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
going to tick the preview box right here

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,240
just to give us a preview of how this

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
looks uh if you want you can adjust your

40
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
rgb values up here as well as the as the

41
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
uh the lightness i like how this looks

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,439
as it is so i'm just going to leave it

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
as it is and click apply

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
and now that we've done that now that

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
this is applied we can close out of this

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
menu and now i want to open up the

47
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
layers menu which is located

48
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
over here or you can just press ctrl

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
shift and l on your keyboard

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
so right this right here layer one this

51
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
is the layer where the image is located

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
we want to create a new layer to trace

53
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
our halftone portrait over this image so

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
i'm going to click the plus icon down

55
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
here and i'm going to add a new layer

56
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
i'm going to use the layer name i'm just

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,759
going to leave the default and position

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
we want to make sure we have above

59
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,560
current and then go ahead and click add

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
create a single circle going over this

62
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,159
image right here so let me grab the

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
circles and ellipses tool i'm going to

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
click and drag on the canvas to create a

65
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
circle i'm going to hold ctrl on the

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,280
keyboard so it makes a perfectly round

67
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
circle like that

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
and i'm going to make this black let me

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,758
grab the select tool and put this

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,680
towards the top of the uh the top left

71
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
corner of the image right here and in

72
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
fact i'm going to scale that down a

73
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
little more

74
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
what i want to do is align this in the

75
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,440
top left corner here so let's open up

76
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
the alignment menu which is over here or

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
you could press ctrl shift a

78
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
and with this circle selected i'm going

79
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
to hold shift and i'm going to click on

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,480
the image so we have them both selected

81
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
and in the align distribute menu i want

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
to make sure i have last selected chosen

83
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
from this relative drop down and i want

84
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
to align this

85
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
to the left edge and then i want to

86
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
align this to the top edge so that is

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
right there in the top left corner and

88
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
now we can click off of that to deselect

89
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
everything

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
so now i'm going to click and drag over

91
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
the circle so i have just the circle

92
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
selected and i'm going to go to edit

93
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,560
clone

94
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
create tiled clones

95
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
and in this menu over here what we're

96
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,160
looking for is

97
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
the trace option

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
now from these settings over here you

99
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
want to make sure you have traced the

100
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
drawing under the clone spray items you

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
want to have that selected you want to

102
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
have color selected you want to leave

103
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
the defaults as they are over here and

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
then down here we only want presence and

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
size selected we don't want either of

106
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
these selected and then down here apply

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
the tiled clones to we want to choose

108
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
width and height and we want to change

109
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
the width and height to match the width

110
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
and height of this image so let me click

111
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
on this image here so i can see the

112
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
width and height as you can see the

113
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,879
width is a thousand pixels wide and then

114
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,560
778

115
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
pixels high

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
so i'm going to change this over here

117
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
let me select the circle again

118
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
i'm going to change this to pixels and

119
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
i'm going to change this to the same

120
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
size that uh the images over here which

121
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
is 1000 by 778 as you can see i already

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
have it inputted here so once you've

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
done that you can just go ahead and

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
click create

125
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,760
and as you can see it's going to create

126
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
a bunch of copies of that

127
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
a bunch of copies of that circle and use

128
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
it to trace over the image here and you

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
can see it a little better if you come

130
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
over here to the layers menu and turn

131
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
off the visibility of layer one you can

132
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,319
see where it traced that image a little

133
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,360
better

134
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,879
now let me turn that back on let me come

135
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
over here let me undo what i just did

136
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
there by pressing ctrl z let me undo it

137
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
again ctrl z one more time ctrl z and

138
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,040
there we go what i want to do is make

139
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
this circle a little smaller and see if

140
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
i can get a better result because i

141
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
clicked on the wrong thing let me make

142
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
this a little smaller

143
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,400
click on create

144
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
and as you can see with the smaller

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
circle it added more circles in here

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
there's more circle density so i think

147
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,199
that looks a little better if you want

148
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
let me undo that again

149
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
if you want you can make this larger and

150
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
see how that looks this is just a matter

151
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
of personal preference at this point if

152
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
you go ahead and click on create you can

153
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
see how that looks right there i liked

154
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
how it looked better with the smaller

155
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
circle so let me undo that one more time

156
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,520
and let me just make that a little

157
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
smaller like that click on create

158
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
there we go now i'm going to come over

159
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
here to the layers menu i'm going to

160
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,880
turn off the visibility of layer one and

161
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
if you zoom out you can really see the

162
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
portrait it almost looks like an actual

163
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
image but if you zoom in all the way you

164
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
can see this is indeed a vector tracing

165
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,360
there is no quality loss here as you

166
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
zoom in these are vectors and the cool

167
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
thing about this is that all of these

168
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,080
circles are linked to the original

169
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
circle so whatever you do to that

170
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
original circle will be applied to all

171
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
of the other circles as well let me show

172
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
you what i mean i'm going to zoom in

173
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
over here i'm going to take this

174
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,280
original circle and move it out of the

175
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
way

176
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
let me zoom out to zoom i'm just holding

177
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
ctrl and rolling up and down the mouse

178
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
wheel to move the page around just

179
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
pressing down the mouse wheel and moving

180
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
the mouse i'm going to take that circle

181
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
and i'm going to make that blue

182
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,639
and as you can see it made all of the

183
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
other circles blue and this works with

184
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
any other transformation as well if i

185
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
make this a little bigger

186
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,919
it's going to make all of those circles

187
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,039
a little bigger and i think that looks

188
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
better right there up close it looks

189
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,000
like a tracing of a bunch of little

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
circles but if you zoom out you can see

191
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
it looks more like a photograph

192
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,919
so i think that should do it for this

193
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
tutorial that is how you can very easily

194
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
go about creating your own

195
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,320
halftone portraits using images in

196
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
inkscape if you have any questions just

197
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
