1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,770
in this video I'll be going over working

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,720
with clones which sounds similar to

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,190
working with duplicates but it's

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,480
actually a little different and I'll be

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,280
explaining that in this video so let's

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,379
go ahead and get started here just for

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,789
example I'm gonna go ahead and create a

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,359
little ellipse like that and a little

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,430
red circle like that I'm gonna convert

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,560
it to a path and we're gonna do now is

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm gonna go to edit clone and I'm gonna

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,910
click the option that says create clone

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,720
what that's gonna do is it's gonna

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,329
create a cloned copy of that original

15
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,790
circle now you may be asking yourself

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,350
well why don't I just create a duplicate

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,760
instead why don't it is right-click it

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,829
and go to duplicate well this is

19
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:42,829
slightly different here this object this

20
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,470
cloned object is linked to this object

21
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,860
here so whatever I do to this object

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,300
it's gonna happen to that object as well

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,770
let me show you as an example I'll scale

24
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,870
that down and that scales down as well I

25
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,239
turn that green that turns green as well

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,489
I go to the paths I go to the other

27
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,620
nodes tool might change the nodes and it

28
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,850
happens to that as well this is

29
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,578
virtually a copy of this object here and

30
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:06,079
anything I do to this will happen to

31
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,490
this as well if you notice here if you

32
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,049
want to look at the nodes there's no

33
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,780
actual nodes here that I can edit if I

34
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,429
want to edit this clone I have to edit

35
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,409
the original clone first in order to do

36
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,439
that now if I want to make this clone

37
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,479
it's very own object and make it so

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,429
that's no longer linked to this object

39
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,459
right here what I can do is go to edit

40
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,249
clone and I can click on unlink clone

41
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:31,069
and now it becomes its own object and if

42
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,329
you notice here you can see there's the

43
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,130
nodes and everything and when I go and

44
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,459
edit this object over here it doesn't

45
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,920
happen to that object there so that's

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,479
how that works now let's go to edit

47
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,319
clone relink - copied okay how this

48
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,119
works is let me create another copy I'm

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,249
gonna take this object I'll go to edit

50
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:54,499
clone create yet create clone and here's

51
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:57,079
a cloned object right here what I can do

52
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,789
is instead of take instead of linking

53
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,340
this clone to this object I can instead

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,020
link it to this object let me just edit

55
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,009
that a little bit do something like that

56
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,449
what I can do is I can copy that by

57
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,949
right-clicking it and going to copy or

58
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,480
you can just hit ctrl C on the keyboard

59
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,280
and then I could take this clone right

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,270
here and go to edit clone

61
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,430
relink - copied and what that does is it

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,260
real inks it to that object there if you

63
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,330
notice here made it that same exact

64
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,510
thing so that's how that works

65
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,770
you look here again edit clone select

66
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,870
original okay so let's say we have a

67
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,430
bunch of objects here right I'm gonna

68
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,260
create a bunch of copies of this clone a

69
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,420
bunch of clones of the clone I'm gonna

70
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,100
mix these all together and shuffle them

71
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,520
all around and you want to select the

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,410
original so you can edit all of them but

73
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,580
you don't know what you want is the

74
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,320
original so what you do is you just

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,380
click on any one of them and go to edit

76
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,560
clone select original and then it'll

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,420
show you where the original one is and

78
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,280
then you can go and edit that further

79
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,860
like that so that's the basics of how

80
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,720
clones work there's a couple of other

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,770
things I want to show you here in this

82
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,290
menu clone clone original path that's a

83
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,060
live a path that's a live path effect

84
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,780
which is something that's totally

85
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,760
different I'll be going over that in its

86
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,250
own video and then there's create tiled

87
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,860
clones which this is an entirely long

88
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,600
video in and of itself which I'll be

89
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,910
going over next but that's the basics of

90
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,610
how you can work with clones in Inkscape
