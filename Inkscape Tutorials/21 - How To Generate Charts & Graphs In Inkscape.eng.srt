00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
in a video that I uploaded last week

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,360
discussing some of the differences

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,580
between illustrator and inkscape one of

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,200
the items that I pointed out was that in

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,880
inkscape you don't have the ability to

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,559
generate charts and graphs like you can

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,900
in illustrator but it turns out I spoke

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
too soon on that one as a commenter

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,680
pointed out there is an extension in

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,660
inkscape that allows you to do this and

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,580
although it is pretty rudimentary it

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,680
does work well enough so let's go over

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,720
how to use this extension

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm going to open up a new document and

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,740
to access this extension we're going to

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,240
come up here to where it says extensions

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,000
we're going to go down to render

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,280
and the item we're looking for is nice

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,820
charts

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,020
and in this menu

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,460
if you come over here to where it says

22
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,739
data you can see we have two different

23
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,899
types of data that we can input we can

24
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,120
choose data from a file I haven't tried

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
this myself but apparently you can

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,020
import data from a CSV file if you'd

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,940
like and then over here we have direct

28
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,079
input which is we're going to be

29
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,239
focusing on for this lesson

30
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,680
now this is where things get a little

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,059
complicated if you come down here to

32
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,219
this text input box you'll see this is

33
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,319
how we go about adding items to our

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,960
chart so every item that you add has to

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,340
have a name here like I've done I've

36
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,760
written in Sample item and then add a

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,979
colon and then the number representing

38
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,020
the percentage of that chart and then

39
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,479
add a comma separating it from the next

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,380
item

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
so it's kind of like writing code here

42
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,439
you're gonna have to write this for each

43
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,000
one of the items that you want in your

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,979
chart and if you're using the percentage

45
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,299
pie chart like I'm using you're going to

46
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,680
want to make sure that these numbers add

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,000
up to 100.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
so I'm going to move this menu off to

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,780
the side and I'm going to tick the live

50
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,400
preview box

51
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,020
and it's going to show you a preview of

52
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,939
what gets generated here

53
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,560
so if I come down here to the chart type

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,180
drop down you can see we have four

55
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,619
different types of charts that we can

56
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,560
choose from if I choose bar chart

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,140
we get something like this right here if

58
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,720
I choose pie chart we get the regular

59
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,860
pie chart

60
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,740
if we choose pie chart percentage it

61
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,240
gives you the same pie chart but with

62
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,100
the numbers having a percentage symbol

63
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,180
after them

64
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,100
and then finally we have stacked bar

65
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,920
chart down here which looks like that

66
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
so I'm going to go back to pie chart

67
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,799
percentage

68
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,598
and if you come over here to the labels

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,400
tab we have some options that we can

70
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
work with you can change the font if

71
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,120
you'd like you can change the font size

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,340
and you could change the font color now

73
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,959
the problem with using this menu is that

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,099
if you want to change the color you're

75
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,540
going to have to manually type in the

76
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,220
hex code and if you want to change the

77
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
font you'll have to manually type in the

78
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,660
font name here so maybe this menu isn't

79
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,879
the best way to go about doing this once

80
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,379
you're finished generating the chart you

81
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,180
can go and do all of that retroactively

82
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,680
using the text tool in the fill and

83
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,420
stroke menu so that's probably a much

84
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,040
easier way to do that so I'm going to

85
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,020
ignore this part of the menu and I'll

86
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,819
come over here to the charts tab

87
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,560
and if you notice we have some more

88
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,540
options that we can work with more

89
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,099
specifically we have the color scheme

90
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,080
that we can change if I click on this

91
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,640
drop down right here I can choose a blue

92
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
color scheme which looks like that I can

93
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,739
choose gray which looks like that

94
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,140
and then we have contrast and then we

95
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,580
have sap

96
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,019
so that's what those options look like

97
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm going to set this back to default

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,379
again this would probably be easier to

99
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,120
change after we generate the chart so

100
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,620
I'm going to leave that as it is for now

101
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,660
and then over here we can add or remove

102
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,400
a drop shadow so this is what it looks

103
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
like with the drop shadow added beneath

104
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,840
the chart if I deselect that we just

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,360
have a flat chart as you can see there

106
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,819
and then finally I'll come over here to

107
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,700
the values tab now the values represent

108
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
the numbers after the item name so if

109
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,300
you don't want those numbers being

110
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,159
displayed there you can just untick that

111
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,080
box and then those values will be

112
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,099
removed

113
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,480
so I'm going to put them back on there

114
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,340
and once you're finished you can just

115
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,319
click the apply button and then close

116
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,959
out of the menu and now you have a pie

117
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,340
chart that you can work with and you can

118
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,560
click on these items individually and

119
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
change their colors like any other

120
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Vector object as you see me doing here

121
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,860
and if you want to change the font of

122
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,920
the text you just grab your text tool

123
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
um if you could find it I'm just going

124
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
to press the letter t on the keyboard to

125
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,480
access it and you can just triple click

126
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,340
your text to select it and choose a new

127
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,620
font using the text menu if you'd like

128
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,700
so that's how you can go about

129
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,580
generating charts and graphs using the

130
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,099
nice charts extension in inkscape

131
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,080
if you found this lesson useful then

132
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,939
consider checking out my inkscape master

133
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,220
class it's a collection of over 60

134
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,079
videos where I go over all of the tools

135
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,880
and features in inkscape and I explain

136
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,620
what they are and demonstrate how they

137
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,418
work kind of like how I did in this

138
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,460
video we even have a private Community

139
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,440
where you can ask questions and get help

140
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,020
from me anytime you want and best of all

141
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,940
there's no monthly membership fees you

142
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,060
just pay 17 one time and you're in for

143
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,740
Life I'll have some information about

144
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,880
that down below if you want to check

145
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,979
that out as always thanks for watching

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,300
all right
