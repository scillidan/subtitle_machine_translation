00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,399
in a previous lesson we went over how

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,959
you can use the various Tools in

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,819
inkscape to draw straight lines and

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,160
curved lines but what if you have a line

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,780
that's already drawn and you just want

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,099
to smooth it out like you see here

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,200
that's what we'll be addressing in

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,480
today's tutorial so let's get started so

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,859
for this demonstration I'm just going to

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,840
draw a quick and sloppy line using the

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,160
freehand lines tool which is located

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,140
over here in the toolbar or you can

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,699
access it by pressing the letter P on

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,840
your keyboard

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,039
I'm going to come up here to the

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,480
smoothing setting and bring that all the

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,640
way down to zero and then I'm going to

18
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,980
click and drag on my canvas to draw a

19
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,219
really rough sloppy line like that

20
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,780
now if I go to the nodes tool you can

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,940
see over here there's a lot going on in

22
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,559
the way of nodes

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,120
and you can see here we have a little

24
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,160
bit of a uh like a hard corner right

25
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,079
there that's okay though because we can

26
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,600
salvage this path let's go to the pathfx

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,719
menu by going to path and selecting

28
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,420
pathfx

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
from the pathfx menu click the plus icon

30
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
down here in the bottom left corner to

31
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,219
add a new path effect

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,480
the path effect we're looking for is

33
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
called simplify so scroll through your

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
list here and look for simplify or you

35
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,760
can type it into the search bar up here

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm going to click on this checkbox

37
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,540
right here to add this path effect and

38
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,040
once that's added all you have to do is

39
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,780
come down here to where it says roughly

40
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,119
threshold and increase that value so I'm

41
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,380
going to hold a click over this plus

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,020
icon here and depending on how rough

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,780
your path is you may have to use a

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,159
higher value so I'm going to hold a

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,479
click over this for a while and if you

46
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,520
notice as I do that it is slowly but

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,700
surely becoming a smoother path

48
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
now if I want to increase it increase

49
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,420
this even more I can come over here to

50
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,159
where it says steps and start increasing

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,200
that as well until I get an even

52
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
smoother path

53
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
so every path will be different but

54
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,960
based on your drawing you may have to

55
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,659
use a higher or lower value here so I'm

56
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,979
going to cycle through the options and

57
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,840
see what looks best I think 10 looks

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,880
good right about there and this value

59
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,259
looks good as well so I'm going to leave

60
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,360
this just as it is

61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,340
so as you can see we now have a much

62
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,380
smoother path and this is a temporary

63
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,759
effect if I come up here to where it

64
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,560
says simplify I can toggle the

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,540
visibility of this off and on to get

66
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,459
back to my original path

67
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,560
if I want to finalize this effect I can

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
come up here to where it says path and

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,940
go to object to path now if you notice

70
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,800
here although the line is a lot smoother

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,780
it's not quite perfect there's a little

72
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,700
bit of hard Corners in here but that's

73
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,379
okay because we can iron those out

74
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,060
manually let's come over here to the

75
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
edit pads by nodes tool and if you

76
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,020
notice if you click on this node right

77
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,580
here where we have a corner we have

78
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,739
these two handles coming off the sides

79
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,260
of it in order for this path in order

80
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,360
for this node to be smooth we need these

81
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,980
handles to be running parallel with each

82
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,239
other so I'm going to move these handles

83
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,560
so that they're parallel with each other

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
and we have a smooth path here a quicker

85
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,580
way to do that would be to just hold

86
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,620
Ctrl and click on the Node and it'll

87
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
make them automatically smooth like that

88
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,920
and then you can just move the handles

89
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
around like that to adjust it as needed

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,459
I'll come over here and do the same

91
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,080
thing I'll hold Ctrl and click on the

92
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,040
Node

93
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,420
and again you can click on the Node

94
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,160
again and adjust the handles as needed

95
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,080
and I'll just go through here and adjust

96
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,940
all of these nodes to ensure that they

97
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,340
are all smooth and they all look the way

98
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,120
I want them to look

99
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,280
and as I do so I will adjust the handle

100
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,860
so I have the right Contour that I

101
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,099
prefer

102
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,640
now we have smoothed out that path so

103
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
that's how you can smooth out a rough

104
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
path using inkscape if you found this

105
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,459
lesson useful then consider checking out

106
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,860
my inkscape master class it's a

107
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,720
collection of over 60 videos where I go

108
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
over all of the tools and features in

109
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,500
inkscape and I explain what they are and

110
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,180
demonstrate how they work kind of like

111
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,580
how I did in this video we even have a

112
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,019
private Community where you can ask

113
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,120
questions and get help from me anytime

114
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,220
you want and best of all there's no

115
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,340
monthly membership fees you just pay 17

116
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,319
one time and you're in for Life I'll

117
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,640
have some information about that down

118
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
below if you want to check that out as

119
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,140
always thanks for watching
