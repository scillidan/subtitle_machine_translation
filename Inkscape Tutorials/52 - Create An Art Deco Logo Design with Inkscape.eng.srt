00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,800
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
you can create this vintage style logo

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,120
design

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,359
using inkscape in order to follow along

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,560
with this tutorial though you will need

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
to download and install the font that i

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,160
used for the word design here it's

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,600
called festival bedai

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
i'll have a link in the description of

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
the video so go ahead and download and

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
install that font before

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
launching inkscape and then we'll be

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,238
good to go before we get started though

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,520
if you'd like to learn more about how

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
inkscape works be sure to check out my

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
inkscape master class

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
it's a collection of over 60 videos

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
where i go through every single tool and

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
feature in inkscape

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
and i explain what it is and i

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
demonstrate how it works i'll have some

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
information about that

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,120
in the description of the video if you

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
want to check that out

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,719
so we'll go ahead and get started here

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,000
in inkscape the first thing i want to do

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,199
is just set up the document i want to

30
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,879
come up here to where it says view

31
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
make sure you have custom selected let's

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
go to zoom let's zoom in at one to one

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
and then i'm going to turn off snapping

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
up here in the top left corner and then

35
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,840
i'm going to open

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
up the um the document properties menu

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
to get rid of this page border and

38
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,799
change the unit of measurement here so

39
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,840
i'll go to

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
file document properties and it should

41
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
open up over here on the side

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,799
display units i'm going to change that

43
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,600
to pixels and i'm going to

44
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
turn off the visibility of the page

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
border which is over here

46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
so now we can close out of document

47
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
properties let's open up the fill and

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
stroke menu which is over here the edit

49
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
objects colors gradients and stroke menu

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
if you click on that

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
or a keyboard shortcut you can just

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
press ctrl shift and f and that'll open

53
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
it as well

54
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,880
so the first thing i'm going to do is

55
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
create the text so let's grab the text

56
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,680
tool

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
which is if i could find it it should be

58
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
over here i'm used to using these

59
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
keyboard shortcuts so i sometimes get

60
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
lost over here in the sidebar so

61
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
let me just type in design as i did for

62
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,240
the thumbnail here if you notice i have

63
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
the word design as the

64
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
primary text i'm going to change the

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,880
font of that

66
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
i'm going to go to text text and font

67
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
and i'm going to look for the font that

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
i installed called festival badaya

69
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,880
click apply and there you go there you

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
have the text now we can close out of

71
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
the text menu

72
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,038
i'm going to grab the select tool and

73
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,479
i'm going to scale this up and i'm just

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
going to hold ctrl while i do that to

75
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
make sure it locks the proportions like

76
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
that

77
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
and now what i want to do is convert

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
this to a path and ungroup it so i'll go

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
to path

80
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
object to path and then go to object

81
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
and we're looking for ungroup and i'm

82
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,239
going to bring down the opacity of this

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,440
roughly in half now you have to have the

84
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
fill and stroke menu open in order to do

85
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
this so make sure you have that opened

86
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,160
i'm going to bring down the opacity

87
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
roughly in half and now i want to move

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
these letters a little closer together

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
so i'm going to hold

90
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
ctrl i'm going to zoom in by holding

91
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
ctrl and rolling up the mouse wheel

92
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
click off of the graphic to deselect

93
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
everything and i'm going to take this

94
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
letter d and i'm just going to move this

95
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
closer but i'm going to hold ctrl while

96
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
i do that to lock it onto the horizontal

97
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
axis like that

98
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
and then i'm going to hold shift and

99
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
click on the letter e so i have both of

100
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,680
these letters selected

101
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
hold ctrl move this closer now i

102
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
understand that the letter s

103
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
here is overlapping with the letters but

104
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,400
that's okay in fact that's kind of the

105
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
point of the design i'm going to be

106
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
incorporating that into the design here

107
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
as you can see so i'm going to hold

108
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
shift click on the letter s so we have

109
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
all three of these letters selected

110
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,239
and to move your view around like this

111
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,599
to move the page you can just press down

112
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
the mouse wheel and move the mouse

113
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
let me move these over while holding

114
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
control to lock the proportions

115
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
and then just do the same thing for the

116
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
rest of the word just go ahead and bring

117
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
these letters in

118
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
like that and now i will press one on

119
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
the keyboard to zoom back out to 100

120
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,519
so now what i'm going to do is i'm going

121
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
to create this shape in the background

122
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
here this emblem so let me

123
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
go back into inkscape and i'm going to

124
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,519
grab the squares and rectangles tool

125
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,480
which is over here

126
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,599
and i'm going to click and drag like

127
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,400
this to create a nice vertical rectangle

128
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,519
going through the word like that you

129
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,040
want to make sure you have sharp corners

130
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
up here if your if your corners are

131
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
rounded just go ahead and click this

132
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,640
corner button up here to make the

133
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
corners sharp

134
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
and now i will grab these circles and

135
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
ellipses tool and i will click and drag

136
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
to create any lips going through that

137
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
rectangle kind of like that

138
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
now if you notice what i'm doing here

139
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
i'm going to take the intersecting area

140
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
between those two shapes

141
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
in order to create this shape right here

142
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
so to do that

143
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,959
first let me make sure i have them

144
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,239
aligned i'm going to grab the select

145
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,680
tool i'm going to hold shift and click

146
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
on the rectangle so i have them both

147
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
selected

148
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
and then i'll open up the align and

149
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,439
distribute menu which is

150
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
over here or you can press ctrl shift

151
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
and a

152
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
and i want to have the relative set to

153
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
last selected

154
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
and i'm going to center it up on the

155
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
vertical axis and then i'll go to

156
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,520
path intersection and there we go now we

157
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,000
have that

158
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,759
shape now don't worry about this shape

159
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
being too big or too small we're going

160
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
to change that later on

161
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
so i'm going to place this right about

162
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
here in fact what i want to do is i want

163
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
to click and drag over the text

164
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
right here to select the text items

165
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
click and drag over just the text not

166
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,080
the whole

167
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
shape just the text itself and go to

168
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
object

169
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
group and then i want to click and drag

170
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
over everything

171
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,639
just to make sure i have this aligned

172
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
vertically i'm going to click on uh

173
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
center on vertical axis right there and

174
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,840
then click off to deselect

175
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,759
everything now what i could do is i

176
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,360
could take this i'm going to hold ctrl

177
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and shift and either scale it up or

178
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
scale it down whatever you want to do

179
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
whatever

180
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,639
whatever you need to do to make it fit

181
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
the design better i like how this looks

182
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
right about here

183
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,880
i'm going to grab the edit paths by

184
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
nodes tool i'm going to click and drag

185
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
over these top nodes right here and then

186
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
just bring them down

187
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
by holding ctrl and just click and

188
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
dragging them down like that

189
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
there we go now let's go back to the

190
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,960
select tool let's make this thing into

191
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
an outline rather than a solid fill so

192
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
let's remove the fill color by clicking

193
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
on this little red x down here in the

194
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,039
bottom left corner

195
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
and then give this a black stroke by

196
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
holding shift and clicking on the color

197
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,080
black over there

198
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
now the thickness of this will vary uh

199
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
you can change that by coming over here

200
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
to the fill and stroke menu

201
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
i'm going to tap i'm going to click on

202
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
stroke style

203
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
and i want this to be about 15 looks

204
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
pretty good

205
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
now whatever it is that you make the

206
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
thickness of your stroke be

207
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
make sure you make a mental note of what

208
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,400
that is because we're going to we're

209
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
going to need that number in just a

210
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
minute so

211
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,560
15 is for this first one right here now

212
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
we'll go to

213
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
path stroke to path path

214
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,440
uh break apart and then go to

215
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
path difference

216
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
oops that was a mistake let me undo that

217
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
edit undo difference

218
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
and then click off of it to deselect

219
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
everything and then take this larger

220
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,039
shape right here

221
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
send that to the back by pressing this

222
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
button over here that says lower

223
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,520
selection to the bottom

224
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
and then hold shift and click on the

225
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
smaller shape right there and go to

226
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
path difference so that you end up with

227
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,360
this shape right here that is a

228
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
path and not a stroke now let's

229
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
duplicate this let's press ctrl d on the

230
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,039
keyboard to make a duplicate copy of

231
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,680
this

232
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,560
go to path uh break apart

233
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
and we'll go to path union

234
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
and now what i'm going to do is i'm

235
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,479
going to make this red and i'm going to

236
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,319
give this a red outline by holding shift

237
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,160
and clicking on the color red like that

238
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
and i'm going to make this outline a

239
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,199
little bigger i'm going to make this

240
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,599
maybe

241
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,400
10. this is going to represent the space

242
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
between the two borders here if you

243
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
notice we made this first border already

244
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
now we're going to make this second

245
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
border this red object is going to

246
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,919
represent the space between those two

247
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,800
borders

248
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,319
so let me go back in there and finish

249
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
this up let me change this make this a

250
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,199
little bigger

251
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
you hold the plus icon to make that

252
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
bigger like that

253
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
that's looking pretty good now when

254
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
you're doing this i probably should have

255
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
noted over here where it says join make

256
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
sure you have a square join you don't

257
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
want a rounded join like that you want

258
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,960
it to be nice and square so you get

259
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
those square corners

260
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
maybe i'll make that a little bit bigger

261
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
and i'll do this again i'll go to

262
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
path stroke to path path

263
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,759
break apart if i can find it there it is

264
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,520
go to object ungroup and then go to

265
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
path union now we're going to do this

266
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
one more time i'm going to add a smaller

267
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
stroke over here now this stroke right

268
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
here was 15 pixels i'm going to make

269
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
this one a little bit smaller so i'm

270
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,520
going to hold shift and click on the

271
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
color black to give that an outline

272
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
let's click the red x to get rid of the

273
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
red fill and i'm going to make this

274
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
something smaller than 15. maybe

275
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
something like 10.

276
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
that right there looks pretty good now

277
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,960
again we want to make sure we have

278
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,599
squared

279
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,319
a square join a squared cap like that

280
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,680
and i'd say that's looking pretty good

281
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,879
right here now again you want to make a

282
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,240
mental note of this so for this one i

283
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
used 15 for this one i used 10.

284
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280
let's go to path stroke to path and

285
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,319
there we go

286
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,840
now we can click off of that to deselect

287
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
everything so let's start working on

288
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,199
these little um

289
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
horizontal bars going across the design

290
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
right here we'll do that next

291
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
to do that what i'm going to do is i'm

292
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
going to grab the squares and rectangles

293
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,560
tool

294
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
i'm going to click and drag to create a

295
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,320
rectangle going through the design right

296
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
here

297
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,880
and i want to get rid of that outline

298
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
i'm going to hold shift and click on the

299
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,640
red

300
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
x and i'm just going to give that a

301
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
black fill by clicking on black right

302
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,919
there

303
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
and this is where we're going to have to

304
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,800
remember this number that we used we

305
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
want to make the height of this the same

306
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
thickness of this border right here so

307
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
that it's consistent all the way through

308
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,920
the design

309
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
so let me grab the select tool let me

310
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,200
change the height of this well first let

311
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
me change the pixels

312
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
let me change this to pixels change the

313
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
height of this to 15.

314
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
there we go move this over here a little

315
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
closer to the word

316
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
maybe make this a little wider you can

317
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
go ahead and adjust the size of this as

318
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
needed

319
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,240
and then i just want to make sure that

320
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
this is aligned on the

321
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,920
vertical axis here so i'm going to hold

322
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
shift click on the emblem behind it

323
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
come back up here to the line distribute

324
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
menu and make sure you have it centered

325
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,279
on the vertical axis like that

326
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,839
and now click off of the deselect

327
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,720
everything and what i'm going to do now

328
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
is i'm going to take this

329
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
shape right here and duplicate that by

330
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
pressing ctrl d

331
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,839
hold ctrl move this up like this and

332
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,279
again we're holding ctrl and clicking

333
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,880
and dragging to lock it onto the axis

334
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,000
like that so it doesn't go

335
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
off off center and i want to make the

336
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
height of this the same as the thickness

337
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,839
of this border so i used 10 pixels for

338
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
that one so i'll make this one 10 pixels

339
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,480
high

340
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
and there you go now i'm just going to

341
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
zoom in let me just zoom in a little bit

342
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
whoops and i just want to make sure that

343
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
the spacing between these two lines

344
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,360
is about equal to the spacing between

345
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
those two lines if you want you can be

346
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
meticulous with this and measurement

347
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
measure it if you want i'm just gonna

348
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
i'm just gonna leave it right about

349
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
there i think that looks close enough

350
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
and then i want to take this and just

351
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
move this in a little bit take this

352
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
arrow move that in

353
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
take that arrow move that in like that

354
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
and then hold shift click on the

355
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
original design behind it

356
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,839
and then just make sure you have that

357
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,240
centered like that now we can click off

358
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
of the graphic to deselect everything

359
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
let me press one on the keyboard to zoom

360
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
back out to 100

361
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
and now i'm going to click and drag over

362
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,399
just those two rectangles right there

363
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,040
that we just

364
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
created and i want to duplicate them

365
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
i'll press ctrl d

366
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
hold ctrl move these ones down here

367
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,839
and i just want to flip them vertically

368
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,760
i could you can click on this button up

369
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
here that says flip selected objects

370
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
vertically what i like to do is just

371
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,279
press the letter v

372
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
on the keyboard much easier and once

373
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,880
you've done that you can click off of

374
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
that

375
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
okay so if you notice what we have here

376
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
we have the structure of the design in

377
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,680
place

378
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
now we just have to go through and uh

379
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,360
fix some of the spacing issues or uh

380
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
finish up what we were doing here as far

381
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
as the spacing goes let me click on the

382
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,560
word right here and then ungroup those

383
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
letters i'll go to object

384
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
ungroup because we previously had those

385
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,519
letters grouped together let me click

386
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
off that to deselect everything

387
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
and now i want to delete out the area of

388
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
the emblem in the background where these

389
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
tool i'm going to create a rectangle

392
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
going over the word like that i'm going

393
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
to make this red so i can see it against

394
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
everything else

395
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120

405
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,000
path

406
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880

path difference

410
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,120

come down here to this one

421
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
so that it looks the same on the bottom

430
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
more there we go

431
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
10. see how that looks that's too much

557
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
maybe seven

558
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
okay good enough now we'll grab the

559
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
select tool hold shift click on the logo

560
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,399
there and just center it up on the

561
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
vertical axis like that

562
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
and for this for this part you could put

563
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
whatever you want up here

564
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
uh for this thumbnail design i put the

565
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
inkscape logo up here just to show you

566
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
that this was an inkscape tutorial

567
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
but i'm just gonna for this for this

568
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
demonstration i'll just put some stars

569
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
in here so let me grab the stars and

570
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
polygons tool

571
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,040
from the settings up here you want to

572
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
make sure you have star selected instead

573
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
of polygon

574
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
five corners spoke ratio of 0.375

575
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
and then zeros for both rounded and

576
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,279
randomized now you can just go ahead and

577
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,800
create a star like that

578
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
hold ctrl and bring your cursor up

579
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
straight up like that to create

580
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
a star like that now let me get rid of

581
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
the the green stroke around there by

582
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
holding shift and clicking on the red

583
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
x let me make this black grab the select

584
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,240
tool

585
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
hold ctrl and shift and scale that down

586
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,839
like that and put that

587
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,559
right about there

588
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,039
and then i want to make a duplicate of

589
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
that i'm going to press ctrl d

590
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
then hold ctrl and move this over here

591
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
like that maybe i'll make this one a

592
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,599
little smaller

593
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
bring that down a little bit ctrl d make

594
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
a duplicate of that hold ctrl move that

595
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
over like that

596
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
and then select all three of those stars

597
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
and make sure that they're spaced apart

598
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
evenly come over here to the

599
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
align and distribute menu and we're

600
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,559
looking for a distribute right here

601
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
and then over here where it says make

602
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
horizontal gaps between objects equal

603
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,280
click on that

604
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
and now you can just group that all

605
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
together by going to object

606
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
group and then you could press you could

607
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
hold shift on the keyboard and click

608
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
on the object right there and just make

609
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
sure you have that centered

610
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
up like that now i'm going to go in here

611
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
and adjust the spacing a little bit so

612
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
it looks a little more consistent maybe

613
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
even make this a little bigger

614
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
press one of the keyboard to zoom back

615
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,720
out to 100 and as you can see we are

616
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
done

617
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
so that is how you can go about creating

618
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
that vintage style

619
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
logo design using inkscape if you have

620
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
