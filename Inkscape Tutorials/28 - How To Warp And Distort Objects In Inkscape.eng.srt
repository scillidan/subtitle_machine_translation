1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:01,920
in this tutorial we'll be going over

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
some of the ways in which you can warp

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,799
and distort objects in inkscape by using

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,240
various path effects so to get started

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,519
we'll have a look at the envelope

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,799
deformation path effect I have this text

7
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,599
object on my screen here I'm going to

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,599
convert this from text to a path by

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,560
selecting it and going to path and

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,439
selecting object to path and now I'll

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,359
open up my path effects menu by going to

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,640
path and selecting path

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,760
effects from the menu I'm going to click

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,519
this plus icon down here to add a new

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,000
path effect

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,759
and the path effect I'm looking for is

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,399
envelope deformation so I'm going to

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,440
select

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
that and let me zoom in on this so I can

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,640
see it better and if you notice in the

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,160
menu over here we have four different

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,840
ways in which we can distort this object

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,879
top bottom left and right so if I click

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,680
this button right here bend the top path

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
we're going to get this green line on

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,440
the canvas you could take that green

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,079
line and move that up like that so you

28
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,719
end up with that effect right there and

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,480
you can click on each node and change

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
these handles so that you get this warp

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,879
effect as you can see here and I'll do

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,280
the same thing down here with the bottom

33
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,840
path I'll change that as

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
well and if you want to change the right

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
and left path you could just click the

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,600
buttons for those as well you can bring

37
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
this in or you could bring it out like

38
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,640
that and I'll do the same thing over

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
here for the left path like this I'll

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
bring this one

41
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
in and then we end up with that effect

42
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,079
right there and then we have these other

43
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,799
options over here that we can enable as

44
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,439
well so if I toggle off the left and

45
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,720
right paths we end up with this effect

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,560
right right there and since this is a

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320
path effect this is temporary and can be

48
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
undone at any time by just toggling off

49
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,840
the visibility of the path effect right

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,799
there or you can remove it by pressing

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,720
the minus button right there so I'll

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,240
turn that back on if you want to

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,000
finalize the effect just go to path

54
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
object to path and now you can grab your

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,920
nodes tool and you can see that this is

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,079
finalized and the path has been warped

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,560
so another way in which you can warp

58
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,079
objects and inkscape is by using the

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,840
bend path effect which allows you to

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
bend an object along a linear path so a

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,880
good example for this here I have this

62
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,240
drawing of a lion and let's say I wanted

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,520
to add a tail to this Lon I created this

64
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,399
simple little tail using an intersecting

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,598
area between two circles and a triangle

66
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,400
and I unified it all together so I'm

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,440
going to place the tail on the lion here

68
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,239
and to make this look curved so it looks

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
more natural I'm going to go to the path

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,519
effects menu and I'm going to add a new

71
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,360
path

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,400
effect and the path effect I'm looking

73
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,440
for this time is Bend so I'm actually

74
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
going to type it up here so I could find

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
it Bend there we go

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
and now if you click this button over

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
here where it says Bend path you have

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,959
this green line that you can edit so I

79
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,480
could take this and pull this down like

80
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,599
that and as you can see there the path

81
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,760
is being or the object rather is being

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,519
bent along that Green Path and you could

83
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,239
adjust these handles and you could take

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,480
this handle over here if you need to

85
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,640
make this wider like

86
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,920
that just like that and there we go we

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,440
have now we have a bent path that looks

88
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,159
more natural like a lion's tail and the

89
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,680
final path effect we'll be having a look

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,440
at is the lattice deformation which

91
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,080
gives you multiple points in which you

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
can warp an object so if I select my

93
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,519
subject here and I add a path effect I'm

94
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,920
going to look for lattice

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,879
deformation there we go and once you

96
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,080
have that applied you can come over here

97
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,000
to your edit pads by nodes tool and you

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,959
can see we have this blue grid with

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,560
nodes placed on it and you could take

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
these nodes and move them around like

101
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,879
this to distort the object so if I go

102
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,360
like that I can make the subject taller

103
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,879
or shorter and can warp and distort it

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,000
in various ways so that it doesn't look

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,480
so so much like the original object

106
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,799
there like that and if I select my

107
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,760
selection tool and toggle this off you

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
could see the difference there we were

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
able to warp this object rather easily

110
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
using that path effect so that's just a

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,040
few of the ways in which you can warp

112
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,319
and distort objects in inkscape if you

113
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,079
found this lesson useful then consider

114
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,560
checking out my inkscape master class

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,360
it's a collection of over 60 videos

116
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,799
where I go over all of the tools and

117
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,920
features in inkscape and I explain what

118
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
they are and demonstrate how they work

119
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,959
kind of like how I did in this video we

120
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,560
even have a private Community where you

121
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,760
can ask questions and get help from me

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
anytime you want and best of all there's

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,079
no monthly membership fees you just pay

124
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,360
$17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
have some information about that down

126
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,358
below if you want to check that out as

127
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,280
always thanks for watching
