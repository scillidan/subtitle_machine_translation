1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,719
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,560
how you can use inkscape to create this

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,879
Elegant Style logo design and if you

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,240
want to follow along with what I'm doing

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,800
in this lesson I will have a link in the

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,040
description of the video to where you

7
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,120
can download the fonts that I used here

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,160
and I'll also include a download link to

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,879
the file itself in case you want to skip

10
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,359
the tutorial and just use this design so

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,080
I'll come over here into a new document

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
and we will get started the first thing

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm going to do is grab my pen tool

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,480
which is located over here in the

15
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,240
toolbar or you can access it by pressing

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,599
the letter B on your keyboard I'm going

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,720
to come up here to the settings and I'm

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,840
going to make sure I have the spiral

19
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,399
path option enabled and then I'm going

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,320
to hold the control key and click once

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,120
on the canvas to draw a line and bring

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,039
this line straight up and while still

23
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,120
holding control click again and then we

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,920
can let go of control and bring the line

25
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,399
out here and then click again and now I

26
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,320
can continue drawing this curve until it

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
spirals to the inside like that once

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
you're happy with the placement you can

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,680
press the enter key to place it and if

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,440
you're not entirely happy with how it

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
looks you can come over here to the edit

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,879
paths by nodes edit paths by nodes tool

33
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,960
and zoom in on this and just adjust

34
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,880
these nodes a little bit now since this

35
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
is a Spyro path it will be a little hard

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,320
to control but that's to ensure that it

37
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,920
remains fluid and smooth so I'm going to

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
adjust this a little bit until I'm happy

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,200
with how it looks and I think that looks

40
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,799
pretty good right there what I'm looking

41
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,079
for mainly is I want to make sure

42
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,720
there's an equal amount of space going

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,680
through here I don't want too much space

44
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,360
on one side I want it to look fairly

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
even so now that that's said I'm going

46
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,640
to zoom out

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm going to take this node right here

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,720
click on it to select it let me Zoom

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,759
down a little bit I'm going to select

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,320
this node right here and then I'm going

51
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,799
to hold the control key and just click

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,520
and drag that node up like that I want

53
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,360
to shorten that a little bit because now

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,479
I'm going to grab the selection tool and

55
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,759
I'm going to right click this and go to

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,719
duplicate and I'm going to flip it

57
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,640
vertically and horizontally and I'm

58
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,799
going to bring this down here on this

59
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,560
side now to snap these together I'm

60
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,799
going to come up here and click on this

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,399
magnet icon to enable snapping and I

62
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,640
just want to make sure I have these

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
simple controls in place I want these

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
two options highlighted and now I can

65
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,200
zoom in on this and snap this onto the

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
line I'm bring that up a little bit I'm

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
just eyeballing this here and that looks

68
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
pretty good as it is now I'm going to

69
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,160
create another one for this side so let

70
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
me right click this and go to duplicate

71
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,840
again and I'm going to take this one I'm

72
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,400
going to flip it vertically and I'm

73
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,160
going to hold my control key and scale

74
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,080
this one down a little bit now before I

75
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,879
do that let me undo what I just did

76
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,560
right there before you scale that down

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
make sure you have this setting disabled

78
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
this option here that says when scaling

79
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
objects scale the stroke width by the

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
same proportion we want that turned off

81
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,360
for this tutorial so make sure that's

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
disabled and then scale this down so

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
that it maintains the same stroke width

84
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
and I'm going to I'm going to place this

85
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,959
one I'm going to snap it right over here

86
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,560
right about there I may make this one a

87
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,080
little bigger I don't like how small

88
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,400
that one is I'll make that a little

89
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,120
bigger and I'll bring that down

90
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,519
here so now that that's in place let me

91
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,440
click off of it to deselect everything

92
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,760
and I'm going to go back to my pen tool

93
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
cool and I'm going to draw another

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,879
little line coming off of the center of

95
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,400
this line here so let me snap to the

96
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
line hold control bring the line

97
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
Straight Up Click again and then bring

98
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,040
this one out here right about there

99
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,120
press enter and there you go that's

100
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,319
about what I'm looking for and again if

101
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,640
you're not happy with the placement you

102
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,159
could just grab the nodes tool and

103
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,680
adjust it until it looks good I'm going

104
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,239
to take this and bring this down a

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,560
little bit I'm going to hold control

106
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
while I do this so that it snaps or so

107
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
that it locks it onto the vertical axis

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,760
and let me right click this and

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,799
duplicate it and I'm going to flip this

110
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,879
vertically and horizontally and bring

111
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,560
this down here so that we have another

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
piece down here going the opposite way

113
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
and that right there is what we're

114
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,280
looking for so what I'll do next is I'm

115
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
going to draw another line coming out of

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
the top right here I'm going to grab my

117
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,720
pen tool again I'm going to snap to this

118
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,799
intersecting area and then just click

119
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
and drag or just click a couple of times

120
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,640
rather to draw a line sort of like that

121
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
and press enter it's not going to look

122
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
good at first but that's okay CU we're

123
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,920
going to go to the edit pads by no noes

124
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,879
tool and adjust this until it looks

125
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,319
right so I'm going to move this you got

126
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
to be careful of the snapping here there

127
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,760
we go and maybe I'll adjust that a

128
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,959
little

129
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,839
bit okay that looks good as it is okay

130
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,320
so let me zoom out now what I'm going to

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,759
do is I'm going to grab my selection

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
tool I want to select all of these

133
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,280
pieces and I want to convert them from

134
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
spiral paths to just regular paths so

135
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
I'll come up here to path and I will

136
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,120
select object to path

137
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
and now I'm going to group them together

138
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,759
by going to object group and now I'm

139
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,600
going to click on it to get the rotation

140
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
handles and I want to rotate this around

141
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,120
clockwise until it's sitting flat like

142
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
this and what I'm looking for is the

143
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
bottom of this side and the bottom of

144
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
this side I want to make sure they're

145
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
both sitting flat on the bounding box of

146
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,120
the selection while I rotate it so let

147
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,800
me just make sure um let me just make

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,199
sure everything's even that looks pretty

149
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,039
good as it is and now I can zoom out and

150
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,400
now we're going to ungroup this so let's

151
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
come up here to object and go to

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,280
ungroup and then open up the fill and

153
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,720
stroke menu and I'll do that just by

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
double clicking this black stripe down

155
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
here and that'll open up the fill and

156
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
stroke menu I want to come over here to

157
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,160
the stroke style Tab and I want to

158
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
increase the width so I'm going to click

159
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,960
on this plus icon and hold that click to

160
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
make this to make those lines thicker

161
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,560
and I want to give them rounded

162
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,960
caps and now I'm going to click off of

163
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
it to deselect everything I'm going to

164
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,759
add little circles at the ends of these

165
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,360
uh lines here show you what I mean in

166
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,919
this design over here I have these

167
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,720
little circles on these ends so let me

168
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,800
show you how you can do that I'm going

169
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,120
to select this object right here first

170
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
and I'll come over here to the markers

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
in the stroke style tab I'm going to

172
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,039
come over here to where it says markers

173
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,000
and I want to add an ends marker I'm

174
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
going to click on this drop down and I'm

175
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,080
going to choose this round option but

176
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,120
when you do that it's going to be a

177
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,360
little too big so I'm going to bring

178
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
that down in size a little bit I'm going

179
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,319
to manually type in the default size is

180
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,880
one I'm going to bring this down to

181
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,039
about 0.5 and see how that

182
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,199
looks okay that's a a good proportion

183
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,919
right there so I'll leave that as it is

184
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,039
and I'm going to do the same thing over

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,319
here I'm going to apply that to this

186
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,720
object as well I'm going to apply that

187
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,919
same marker now now that you applied the

188
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
first marker you should have it up here

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
in your recently used markers and you

190
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
can just select it and you won't have to

191
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
resize this one it'll inherit the size

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,599
of the previous

193
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,160
one and I'll apply that to this part as

194
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,319
well let me come up here and choose uh

195
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,680
the same

196
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
marker and now I'm just going to put

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
just as like a decorative element I'm

198
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,160
going to put three little circles in

199
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,440
there so let me come back in here and

200
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,199
add those three little circles let me

201
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,000
grab my circles and ellipses tool I'm

202
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,319
going to turn off snapping right now

203
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,160
that's just going to get in the way and

204
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,840
I'll hold control and click and drag to

205
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,520
draw perfectly around Circle go back to

206
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,680
my selection

207
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,800
tool and I will make this a little

208
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,880
bigger actually no I'll leave that as it

209
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,039
is I'll right click it go to duplicate

210
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,080
and I'll make this one a little

211
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,800
bigger and then I'll create one more

212
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
right click duplicate and I'll make this

213
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,199
one even even

214
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,520
bigger holding control while I do this

215
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
to lock the aspect ratio there we go now

216
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm going to zoom

217
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,360
out okay that looks pretty good so what

218
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,479
I'm going to do now is I'm going to

219
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
select all of this well first of all let

220
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
me click on one of these and find out

221
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,560
what exactly the stroke weight is so for

222
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,199
mine the stroke weight is six so

223
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,800
whatever your number is keep that in

224
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
mind we're going to use that in just a

225
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
minute let me select all of this go to

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,080
object group and now I'm going to create

227
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,879
a Circle so I'm going to grab my circles

228
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,280
and ellipses tool click and drag while

229
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
holding control to create a perfectly

230
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,759
round circle and I want to give this the

231
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,560
same properties that this these objects

232
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,520
have so I'm going to remove the fill by

233
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,199
clicking the Red X and I'm going to hold

234
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,840
shift and click on the color black to

235
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,639
apply a stroke and it looks like it

236
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,319
inherited that stroke width already so I

237
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,000
don't have to manually type that in if

238
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,599
this were any other number than six I'd

239
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,080
have to type that in and press enter but

240
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,440
it looks like I'm good to go so let me

241
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
take this and move this over I'm going

242
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,120
to scale this down accordingly I'll

243
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
bring it down maybe that much

244
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
and I want to make sure that this is

245
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
sitting on the same horizontal plane

246
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,919
that this object is so let me select

247
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,479
this object hold shift select this

248
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,360
object and then open up the aligned

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
distribute menu by going to object and

250
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,159
aligned

251
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,520
distribute and I'm going to choose last

252
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,639
selected from the relative two dropdown

253
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,080
and I want to choose this option down

254
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,039
here that says align bottom edges and

255
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,919
that's going to put both of those on the

256
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
same horizontal plane and I'm going

257
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
click off of that to deselect it and

258
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,039
then I'll take this one and just move

259
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,680
this in a little bit and I'm holding

260
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
control while I click and drag so that I

261
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,039
lock it onto that horizontal plane and I

262
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,560
don't lose that alignment that I just

263
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,360
made okay so let me take this object now

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
right click it go to duplicate I'm going

265
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,279
to flip this one

266
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,800
horizontally hold control and move this

267
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
one over here just like

268
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,399
that and now I'm going to select both of

269
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,880
these I'm holding shift while I click on

270
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,720
each of them to select them both and I

271
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
want to group them together we'll go to

272
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,600
object group and I want to Center it on

273
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,920
this circle just to make sure that

274
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,720
everything is perfectly symmetrical I'll

275
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,040
select the uh Center on vertical axis

276
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,360
there we go and now I can ungroup

277
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,560
everything so I'll go to object and

278
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,600
select

279
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
ungroup and now I'm going to put another

280
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,120
Circle in the center here so let me take

281
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,720
this circle right click it go to

282
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,440
duplicate hold control and shift and

283
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,160
scale this down about that much and in

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,519
here you can put whatever you want

285
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,560
whether it be a letter or an icon or any

286
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,519
other graphical depiction for my

287
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,560
demonstration I use the inkscape logo I

288
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,000
figured it makes sense since this is an

289
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,040
inkscape tutorial but you could put

290
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,920
whatever you want in there I'm just

291
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,519
going to leave it blank for now and now

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,040
I'm going to put some lines underneath

293
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
it here if you notice I had some lines

294
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,800
going underneath these

295
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
elements so let me come back in here I'm

296
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
going to grab my pen tool again let me

297
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
choose the regular pen mode and then

298
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
I'll come out here click to add a point

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
hold control bring the line straight

300
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,279
across right towards the end of the

301
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,160
other side click again and now we can

302
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
let go of control and and press enter to

303
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,600
have that line made and I want to make

304
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,399
that stroke the same size let me grab my

305
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,519
selection tool I'll come back over here

306
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,200
to the fill in stroke menu the stroke

307
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
style tab I'll change this to

308
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
six I want this to have rounded caps and

309
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm going to put those markers on the

310
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
ends of these so let me use this drop

311
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,680
down and select those markers for the

312
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,399
first and the last the start and the end

313
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,839
point of that path and it now has those

314
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,120
markers so let me make another copy of

315
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,640
this now I'm going to right click it and

316
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,120
go to duplicate hold control and bring

317
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,279
this one down here about that much now

318
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,760
the amount of spacing between these two

319
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
lines I'm going to use these circles as

320
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,560
a reference I want the spacing between

321
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,800
these two lines to be about equal to the

322
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,639
spacing between these two circles so I'm

323
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,120
just going to eyeball that and use my

324
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
own judgment it just gives the design an

325
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,800
overall more balanced and symmetrical

326
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,000
look and once that's in place I'm going

327
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,399
to hold control and shift and I'm just

328
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,720
going to scale this down a little bit I

329
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
want this line to be a little shorter

330
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
than the other line and that right there

331
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,800
is what we're going for so now we're

332
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,519
going to add our text

333
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,040
let me grab the text tool click and for

334
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
this demonstration I'm just going to

335
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
write

336
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
elegant grab my selection tool and I'm

337
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
going to open up the text editor which

338
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,440
can be accessed by uh going to you can

339
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,959
use this icon down here in the bottom

340
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,560
right of the screen this letter T click

341
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,040
on that and now we have our text editor

342
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,120
so let me find the font that I'm using

343
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,600
it's called

344
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Brittanic there we go I'll click apply

345
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,800
and I'm just going to scale this up to

346
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,639
make make it an appropriate size for the

347
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,839
logo maybe I'll scale this down a little

348
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,240
bit and again we're always holding

349
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
control when we scale so that it locks

350
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
the aspect ratio if you let go of

351
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,800
control you get a lot of distortion

352
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,240
which you don't want and now I'm just

353
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,880
going to write logo in a different font

354
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,079
next to it so let me go back over here

355
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,399
to my text tool click again and I'm just

356
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
going to use all caps

357
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,160
logo and the font for this one is

358
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,000
monserat monserat medium and again I'll

359
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,519
have the links to these fonts where you

360
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,560
can download them and install them in

361
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,720
the descript description of the video

362
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,560
These are free fonts so you should be

363
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,720
able to use them without a problem let

364
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,519
me move this in

365
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,200
here scale it up so it's about the same

366
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,399
size and I want to decrease the the

367
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,040
spacing between these letters so let me

368
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,800
come back in here to my text tool I'm

369
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,399
going to place the cursor between these

370
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,440
two letters and I'm going to hold my ALT

371
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
key or if you're on Mac it would be the

372
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,279
option key and then use the left Arrow

373
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,600
just to bring that

374
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
in and I'll do the same thing over here

375
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,720
I'll move the cursor over here holding

376
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
my option key or ALT key and just use

377
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,600
using the arrows to bring those letters

378
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,639
closer

379
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,480
together now I'm going to grab my

380
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,000
selection tool select both of these and

381
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,399
I'm just going to scale this up so that

382
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,120
it fits the logo more

383
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,560
nicely and at this point the problem we

384
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,800
have now is that the design doesn't look

385
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
very consistent the lines of the

386
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,760
ornaments here are much thinner than the

387
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,120
lines of the letters uh an easy little

388
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,720
trick to fix that you could just select

389
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,760
everything hold your control key and

390
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,399
scale it down a little bit

391
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,720
and as you scale It Down The Strokes

392
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
will remain the same weight but they

393
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
will just look bigger because they're

394
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,839
being sized smaller and I'll just bring

395
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,800
this down until it looks pretty

396
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,079
consistent with the weight of the

397
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,040
letters and that's really the secret

398
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,399
here to making this design look good you

399
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,320
want all of the lines to be a consistent

400
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,000
weight so that it has a uniform

401
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,360
look okay that looks good as it is let

402
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,320
me uh let me update the spacing now a

403
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,760
little bit I'm going to move this down

404
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm going to move this line let me

405
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,279
deselect that

406
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,639
I'm going to move this line down a

407
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,079
little bit and now I'm going to adjust

408
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,120
the spacing in here to accommodate the

409
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,560
spacing change that I made there let me

410
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,199
scale that down a little bit I'm holding

411
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
control and shift while I scale this

412
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,760
inward so that I don't lose the

413
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,480
orientation with the circle above

414
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,680
it and there we go that should do it for

415
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,480
this tutorial that is how you can create

416
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,399
these decorative elements to make an

417
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,880
elegant style logo using inkscape if you

418
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
found this lesson useful then consider

419
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
check checking out my inkscape master

420
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,519
class it's a collection of over 60

421
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,160
videos where I go over all of the tools

422
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,199
and features in inkscape and I explain

423
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,759
what they are and demonstrate how they

424
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,480
work kind of like how I did in this

425
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,839
video we even have a private Community

426
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,560
