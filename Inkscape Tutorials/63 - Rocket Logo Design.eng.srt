00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,960
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,639
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,679
you can create this

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,720
rocket logo design using inkscape but

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,000
before we get started if you'd like to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
learn more about how inkscape works be

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,359
sure to check out my inkscape master

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,000
class

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
it's a collection of over 60 videos

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
where i go over all of the tools and

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,560
features in inkscape

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
and i explain what they are and

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,519
demonstrate how they work i'll put a

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
link in the description of the video if

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
you want to check that out

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,480
so to get us started here in inkscape

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,760
the first thing i want to do is just set

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,079
up

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
the uh the screen here so that we're all

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
working with the similar layout i want

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
to come up here to where it says view

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
make sure we have custom selected i'm

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
going to come over here to where it says

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,239
zoom and i'm going to zoom in at one to

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,120
one

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,800
and then i'm going to open up the align

28
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,160
and distribute menu with this button

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
over here or you can press ctrl

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
shift and a i want to have last selected

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
chosen from this relative two

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
and then i want to open up the fill and

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
stroke menu which is over here you can

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
click on that or you can press ctrl

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
shift and f to open that up so what i'm

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
going to do first is i'm going to create

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
a circle that is going to

38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
encapsulate the entire design so let me

39
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
grab the circles and ellipses tool

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
i'm going to hold ctrl and shift on the

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
canvas i'm going to hold ctrl and shift

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
and click and drag on the canvas to

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
create a perfectly round circle like

44
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,080
that

45
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
now let me grab the select tool let me

46
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,759
move this over what i want to do now is

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,200
just bring down the opacity of this a

48
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,799
little bit i'm going to take the opacity

49
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
bring that down roughly in half we're

50
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,360
going to want to be able to see through

51
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,640
what we're working with

52
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
as we go through this tutorial one other

53
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,920
thing i wanted to

54
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
i forgot to mention up here where it

55
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,439
says enable snapping make sure you have

56
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,040
this turned off for the duration of this

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
tutorial or for now anyway so

58
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
go ahead and disable that i think by

59
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
default it's enabled so just go ahead

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,399
and

61
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,799
disable that so we have our circle right

62
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
there what i want to do is just

63
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
duplicate this circle by hitting control

64
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,159
d

65
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,479
i'm going to make this copy green and

66
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,840
i'm going to hold ctrl and shift and

67
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
scale this down a little bit

68
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,240
and what i'm going to do here is i'm

69
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,079
going to create some plumes of smoke

70
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
going towards the bottom of the uh

71
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,520
the bottom of the design here let me

72
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
show you here we're going to create this

73
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
segment right here using a bunch of

74
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
individual circles so let me

75
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
minimize that i'm going to make this one

76
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,520
a little bigger

77
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
put this right about here duplicate this

78
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
by pressing ctrl d

79
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
make this one a little smaller again

80
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
holding ctrl and shift while scaling

81
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,319
this down to lock the proportions

82
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
ctrl d to duplicate again hold ctrl and

83
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
shift make this one a little smaller

84
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
maybe i'll put this over here

85
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,360
put the medium size over here on the

86
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,040
left put the smaller one right here like

87
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
that

88
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
maybe make this a little smaller

89
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
duplicate this by hitting ctrl d bring

90
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
this over here

91
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
duplicate this one put this over here

92
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
maybe like that and right there that's

93
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,080
about what i'm looking for i want to

94
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
have this

95
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
this is going to represent the the the

96
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
clouds are like the exhaust coming from

97
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,920
the rocket here

98
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
and uh what i want to do now is i just

99
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
want to make sure the bottom portion of

100
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,400
this design is covered in as well so i'm

101
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,599
going to duplicate some more of these

102
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,879
circles

103
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,720
and just scale them up so that it's

104
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
covering the entire portion of the

105
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
design as you can see i'm stamping these

106
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
circles by pressing spacebar as i move

107
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
them around

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,239
that right there is what we're looking

109
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,440
for we want to make sure everything's

110
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
covered here we don't have any of the

111
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
main circles sticking out let me just

112
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,360
zoom in to make sure

113
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
okay good we don't want any of that

114
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,319
and what i'm going to do now is if you

115
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
notice over here there's little indents

116
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
coming in from these circles so we're

117
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
going to create those next

118
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
so let me go and take i'm going to start

119
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,799
with this circle right here

120
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,400
to zoom in and out i'm holding ctrl and

121
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
rolling up the mouse wheel

122
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
and to move them to move the page around

123
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
i'm pressing down the mouse wheel and

124
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
moving the mouse

125
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
i'm going to duplicate this by hitting

126
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,239
control d i'm going to make that red

127
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,760
and then i'm going to duplicate it again

128
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
by hitting control d and i'm going to

129
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
make this one green

130
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
and let me just move this one over like

131
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
this and we're

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
looking at the uh the area that's

133
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
sticking out here the color of red

134
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,080
that's sticking out that's what we want

135
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,159
to pay attention to

136
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,519
something like that right there is what

137
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
i'm looking for i'm going to hold shift

138
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
click on the red circle behind it so we

139
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
have both of these selected and go to

140
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,599
path

141
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
difference now i want to do the same

142
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
thing for all of the circles at the top

143
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
here so let me zoom in so i can see this

144
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
a little better

145
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
i want to move this circle over so that

146
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
it's intersecting with this area a

147
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
little more so let me duplicate this by

148
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
hitting ctrl d

149
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
make that red duplicate it again make it

150
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,439
green

151
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,959
and i'll move this one out here like

152
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,199
this

153
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
and one thing i'm looking for when i do

154
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,800
this i want to make sure if you notice

155
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
the tip

156
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,840
of the uh the red crescent here is going

157
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,280
over the red crescent over here that we

158
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,639
previously created we want to make sure

159
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
that those two things are intersecting

160
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
and overlapping completely

161
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
you don't want to leave it like this

162
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
where it's not going all the way through

163
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
so that's one thing to keep in mind

164
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
while you're going about this

165
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
if you have to you can take this one

166
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
hold shift click the one beneath it and

167
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
then just click it again to get the

168
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
rotation handles and just rotate it

169
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
around

170
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
to position it in a better spot all

171
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
right so that that right there is good

172
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,360
how it is i'm going to hold shift

173
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
click both of those and go to path

174
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
difference there we go

175
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
and maybe maybe i'll rotate these around

176
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
a little bit like that

177
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,120
and i'm gonna have to move this one i

178
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
can tell already i'm gonna move this one

179
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,039
up here

180
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
again duplicate that make that red

181
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
duplicate it again make it green

182
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
and i'm going to position this one like

183
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,120
this

184
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
maybe over here like this

185
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,800
again now this is not overlapping so

186
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
what i want to do is move this

187
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,360
down like that there we go that's what

188
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
i'm looking for now let me take those go

189
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,479
to path

190
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
difference again to select two objects

191
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
at the same time just holding shift

192
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
and clicking each of them do the same

193
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
thing over here ctrl d

194
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,120
we're pretty much just repeating this

195
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,639
process over and over again until we get

196
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,280
to the

197
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,000
end of the exhaust plume here

198
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
that's good

199
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,199
oops did i miss that there we go and

200
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
we'll do the same thing over here

201
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,479
you know i'm going to rotate this around

202
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
a little bit

203
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,680
yeah maybe i'll rotate it around some

204
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,039
more like that oops

205
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
okay that's good and then finally this

206
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
last one over here i'm going to

207
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
just adjust that a little bit duplicate

208
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,680
that

209
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
make that red duplicate it again make it

210
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
green

211
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,560
and there we go path difference

212
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
okay so we have this set in place now

213
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
what i want to do now is

214
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
if you notice the areas where the red

215
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
crescents the tips of them are sticking

216
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
out from each other i just want to go

217
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,759
and manually

218
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,919
remove those from certain areas so i'm

219
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
going to remove this area from this

220
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
crescent here to do that i'm going to

221
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
grab the bezier pen

222
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
which is over here you can press b on

223
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
the keyboard i'm going to create

224
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
an object going around the tip of that

225
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
crescent right there

226
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
grab the select tool hold shift click on

227
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
the red shape and go to path

228
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
difference and i'll do the same thing

229
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,960
over here back to the bezier pen

230
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
i'm just going to press b on the

231
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
keyboard it's easier to do it that way

232
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,039
back to the starting point back to the

233
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
select tool for that we press s on the

234
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,599
keyboard

235
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,360
hold shift path difference

236
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
and i'll go over here and do the same

237
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
thing let me get rid of the uh

238
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
this area right here path

239
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
difference

240
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
oops path

241
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,039
difference there we go and then i'll

242
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,479
delete this part right here so let me

243
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
grab the bezier pen again

244
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
bring this through like that

245
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,960
back to the select tool actually no this

246
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,919
one right here

247
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
path difference there we go

248
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
okay so now i want to take all of the

249
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
red objects right here i'm just going to

250
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,960
click on one of them

251
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,639
and go to edit select same

252
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
fill color and that's going to select

253
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,520
all of the red objects right there and

254
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,080
go to

255
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
path union and now i want to unify

256
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
all of the green circles together so let

257
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
me click on the green circle and go to

258
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
edit

259
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
select same fill color and go to

260
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
path union okay so what i want to do now

261
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
is create an offset

262
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,639
of this um this green

263
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
cloud right here so to do that i'm just

264
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
going to press ctrl d

265
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
on the keyboard to duplicate that i'm

266
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
going to make this blue

267
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
and i'm going to lower this beneath the

268
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,039
other two objects we just created so

269
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,160
come up here where it says lower

270
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
selection one step i'll click that once

271
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
and then twice we want it to go beneath

272
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
the red and the green objects and then

273
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,080
go to

274
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
path and we're looking for dynamic

275
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
offset

276
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
and once we get dynamic offset we're

277
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,839
going to take this little node right

278
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
here and just bring this out like that

279
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
maybe about that much that's a good

280
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,880
amount of padding right there so we'll

281
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,279
go to

282
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,200
path object to path to to finalize that

283
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
we're going to what i'm going to create

284
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
now is the exhaust trail coming from the

285
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
rocket let me show you here this little

286
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
stream this little jet stream coming

287
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,839
from the rocket that's going to be the

288
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,399
next

289
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
thing that we create so let's move this

290
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
off to the side a little bit again to

291
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
move the page around just

292
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
pressing down the mouse wheel and moving

293
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
the mouse i'm going to grab the

294
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
rectangles tool right here

295
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
create a rectangle like this make this

296
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
green because we want that to match this

297
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
green here

298
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
and now i'm going to grab the circles

299
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
and ellipses tool and make another

300
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
make a an ellipse going over it like

301
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
that now let me make that red so we can

302
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
see it

303
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,839
grab the select tool

304
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
duplicate this shape by pressing ctrl d

305
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
and then hold ctrl and click and drag

306
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
this off to the right over here

307
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
and what we're paying attention to is

308
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
the intersecting area between

309
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
uh or the absent area between the two

310
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
red red circles here this green

311
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
object is what's going to be what

312
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
remains so let me bring this down a

313
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,600
little bit

314
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
this is going to be our little jet

315
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,680
stream right here so

316
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,959
i think that looks good right there so

317
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,560
i'm going to hold shift click both red

318
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,600
circles go to

319
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
path union hold shift click on the green

320
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
rectangle and go to path

321
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
difference and what i'm going to do now

322
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
is create

323
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
some empty space in the middle of it

324
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
like you see right here

325
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
so to do that let me duplicate this ctrl

326
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
d i'll make this red i'm going to bring

327
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,839
this in a little bit

328
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
bring this side in a little bit bring

329
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
this in some more like that

330
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
move this over that's looking pretty

331
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,200
good

332
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
now let me hold shift and click on both

333
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,560
of those so we have them both selected

334
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,760
and where it says align we're gonna go

335
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
to our align menu and click on

336
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,720
uh center on vertical axis like that and

337
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,920
now i'm just gonna take this

338
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,399
maybe bring this down a little bit bring

339
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
this up a little bit so that

340
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
it sticks out from the edges there and

341
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,440
then select them both

342
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
and go to path difference

343
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
and now we have our little jet stream so

344
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,079
let me hold ctrl and just scale this

345
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,880
down

346
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
let me put this in place over here with

347
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
the rest of the design

348
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
that's looking pretty good i'm going to

349
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
hold shift click on the circle so we can

350
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
center this up on our emblem here

351
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
there we go click off of that to

352
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
deselect everything now i'm going to

353
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,000
take this

354
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
and i'm going to lower it beneath the

355
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,120
cloud here so i'm going to click this

356
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
button that says lower selection one

357
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
step

358
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
one two three we want it going beneath

359
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
the blue object there but above the

360
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
black circle here so let me zoom back

361
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,320
out

362
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
this time we're going to use a different

363
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
approach for creating the offset we're

364
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,079
going to use a stroke this time because

365
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,040
of the way that this

366
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
object is structured so let me duplicate

367
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
this object by hitting ctrl d

368
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,079
i'm going to make this blue and then

369
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
give it a blue stroke by holding shift

370
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,000
and clicking on the color blue

371
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
and i'm going to lower that down until

372
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
it goes beneath the green

373
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
object there and i want to come over

374
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
here to where it says stroke style

375
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,760
and just adjust the thickness of it here

376
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
if you notice the thickness of the blue

377
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
offset over here

378
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
we want this to be significantly thicker

379
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,800
than that

380
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
so let me increase that a little bit

381
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
okay right about there that looks good

382
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,560
you can just eyeball it that right there

383
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,519
looks pretty good so i'm going to go

384
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,480
ahead and go to

385
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,560
path stroke to path path

386
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,839
break apart we're going to ungroup this

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
and then go to path union and the

388
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
ungroup is right here if you hover the

389
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
cursor over the button it says

390
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
ungroup selected objects i just click it

391
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
a couple of times just to make sure it's

392
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
ungrouped

393
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,079
and now what we can do is i'm going to

394
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,880
take this blue object right here

395
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
i'm going to duplicate that by pressing

396
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
ctrl d i'm going to hold shift

397
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
click on the green object right here and

398
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
go to path

399
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
difference and if you notice we now have

400
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
that cut off there it's going to be

401
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,560
separated from the cloud at the bottom

402
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,600
there so

403
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
that's why we did that now i'm going to

404
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,040
take the the black circle in the

405
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
background control d

406
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
to duplicate that hold shift click on

407
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
the green cloud right there

408
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
go to path intersection

409
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,959
and then what i want to do is i want to

410
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,880
take this blue object

411
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,440
hold shift take this blue object and

412
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,959
then go to

413
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,399
path union

414
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
and then hold shift and click on the

415
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,680
black circle and go to

416
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,600
path difference and now we have that

417
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
there so let me go to

418
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
now i'm going to go to path break apart

419
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
click off of the object to deselect

420
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
everything and if you have this little

421
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
center piece here in the middle you just

422
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
take that and get rid of it

423
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
so what i'm going to do now is i'm going

424
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
to take this red object right here

425
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
hold shift click on the green cloud and

426
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
go to path

427
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
difference and there we have the uh

428
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
the exhaust with the um cloud plume

429
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,639
there

430
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
so what we have to do now is let's we

431
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
can start we can actually start coloring

432
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
this in now so let me select all of this

433
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
bring the opacity all the way up like

434
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
that and i'm going to use a shade

435
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,519
similar to what i used for the thumbnail

436
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,279
design like a dark purple

437
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
combined with a lighter shade of purple

438
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
like that

439
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
there we go i'm going to take that i'm

440
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
just going to use the dropper to make

441
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,199
that the same color

442
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
there we go and now i'm going to put

443
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
some stars in the background here to

444
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,519
make it look more like it's

445
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
more like it's in space like that so go

446
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
ahead and grab the

447
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,959
we're looking for the stars and polygons

448
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
tool which is right here

449
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,399
for the settings we're going to want

450
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
this one selected right here that says

451
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
star instead of regular polygon we're

452
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
going to want four corners

453
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
spoke ratio 0.401

454
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
and then rounded and randomized both set

455
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
to zero i'm just going to hold ctrl and

456
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
shift and create our little star like

457
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,320
that

458
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,839
i'm going to get rid of that stroke or

459
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,600
that blue outline by holding

460
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
shift and clicking on this little red x

461
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,880
down here

462
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
and i'll take this and just bring this

463
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
over here like this scale it down so it

464
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,120
fits

465
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
i'll make this white and i'll just add a

466
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,079
few of these in here

467
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,160
at different sizes to make it look more

468
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,639
natural

469
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,279
if you'll make this one a little bigger

470
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,399
like that there we go and i'll put the

471
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,680
same thing over here on this side so

472
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
i'll just select all four of those

473
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
hit ctrl d to duplicate and then flip

474
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
them horizontally

475
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
with this button up here and then just

476
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,959
move these over here like that

477
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,880
and there we go so now we have the stars

478
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
set in place so the final step now

479
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
is to create the little rocket at the

480
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
top of the design here so to do that

481
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,040
let's come over here to the side i'm

482
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
going to grab the circles and ellipses

483
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
tool hold ctrl and shift and click and

484
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,279
drag to create a perfectly round circle

485
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,040
and showing up as white on my screen so

486
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
once you've done that you'll have to

487
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,519
change it to a different color like

488
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,240
black

489
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
bring the opacity down in half grab the

490
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,839
select tool

491
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
duplicate it with ctrl d and just hold

492
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
ctrl and bring this over like this what

493
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,040
we're looking at here

494
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
is the intercepting area between these

495
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,399
two circles

496
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,839
that's going to make up the top of the

497
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
rocket so let me select both of those

498
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
and go to path intersection

499
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
and now i'm going to create the little

500
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
fins on the side so to do that i'm

501
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,120
actually going to create a triangle so

502
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
to create a triangle

503
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,320
i'm going to grab this the squares and

504
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
rectangles tool

505
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
control and shift to create a perfectly

506
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,680
symmetrical square like that

507
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
make sure it has sharp corners by

508
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
clicking that button right there if

509
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
it's not if you're not able to click

510
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,279
that button that means you already have

511
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
sharp corners you're good to go

512
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,199
convert that to a path by going to path

513
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
object to path

514
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
grab the nodes tool and then just take

515
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
this node right here in the bottom right

516
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,519
and press delete on the keyboard to get

517
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,560
rid of it

518
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
now select all three of these nodes and

519
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
come up here to where it says

520
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
make selected nodes corner

521
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,399
like that go back to the select tool

522
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,920
click on the object again so we get the

523
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,279
rotation handles and i'm going to hold

524
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
ctrl and just rotate this counter

525
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,240
clockwise like this

526
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,519
so that it's sitting up like that i'm

527
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
going to position this over here next to

528
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,480
the side of the rocket

529
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
you can click on it again to get the

530
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
scaling handles i'm just going to scale

531
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
it so that it

532
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
fits next to the uh the body of the

533
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,240
rocket here

534
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
now i just want to adjust this a little

535
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
bit so i'm going to grab the nodes tool

536
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,920
over here

537
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,199
i'm just going to click and drag this

538
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
node up here like this and maybe i'll

539
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
take this node and bring this over to

540
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,600
the left as well

541
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,959
bring this down a little bit maybe bring

542
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
that up

543
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,519
you know what this needs to be down a

544
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,959
little more like that that looks better

545
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,399
okay so now i'm just going to duplicate

546
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,120
that

547
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,320
ctrl d flip it horizontally

548
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
hold ctrl click and drag it over here to

549
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,839
the right

550
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
and now we're going to unify both of

551
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,559
them together by holding shift and

552
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,919
clicking on both of them so we have them

553
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,000
both selected and go to path

554
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
union and now we can hold shift

555
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,959
click on this little uh shape right here

556
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
center that up where it says a line

557
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
come over here to where it says center

558
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
on vertical axis

559
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
make sure it's centered up go to path

560
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
union

561
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
and now i'm just going to close off the

562
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,559
bottom over here i'm going to grab the

563
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
rectangle tool and create a little

564
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
rectangle going over the bottom there

565
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
grab the select tool hold

566
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,799
shift click on the rocket and go to path

567
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
union and now i'm just going to add a

568
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,919
little circle right here for like a

569
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,480
little

570
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,440
i guess it's kind of like a little

571
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
window i'm going to put right there so

572
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
to do that

573
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
i'm going to grab the circles and

574
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
ellipses tool hold ctrl and shift

575
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,559
click and drag to create a perfectly

576
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,400
round circle right there position that

577
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
right about there

578
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,799
or maybe right there select both of

579
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,360
those

580
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
and center them up on the vertical axis

581
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,799
then duplicate this circle take that

582
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
ctrl d let me zoom in a little bit

583
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,320
there we go take the larger circle hold

584
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,799
shift

585
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
and select the rocket as well go to path

586
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,039
difference there we go now we have our

587
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,320
window set

588
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
let me select both of those and go to

589
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
path union

590
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,840
and now our rocket is set we just need

591
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,520
to place it over the design over here so

592
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,720
to do this i'm just going to place it

593
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
over here

594
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,840
i'm going to hold ctrl scale it down a

595
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
bit

596
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
let's unify these two objects right here

597
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
the sky let's take this guy

598
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
hold shift take the other side of the

599
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
sky and go to path

600
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
union because i want to make sure that

601
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
this rocket is centered up on this

602
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
design here so let me take the rocket

603
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,880
hold shift

604
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
click on the sky and then center it up

605
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
on the vertical axis like that

606
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
just bring this down make it a little

607
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,240
smaller like that

608
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,600
i'm going to bring the opacity all the

609
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,799
way up and i'm going to make it the same

610
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
color as the sky here so let me grab the

611
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,039
dropper

612
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,919
and grab that sample selection now i

613
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
want to create another offset of this to

614
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,559
put above the

615
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,240
jet stream here so to do that ctrl d

616
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
make this white hold shift click on

617
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
white again to give this a white stroke

618
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
and then lower this lower selection one

619
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,039
step to put it beneath

620
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,640
the rocket there and come over here to

621
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
the stroke style tab again

622
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,720
and adjust the width of this so that's

623
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,440
not quite

624
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,840
as wide

625
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,600
i'm just going to go ahead and position

626
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,440
this where i'd like it to be maybe down

627
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,919
a little more

628
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
that's pretty good right there so once

629
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
we've done that you can click off it to

630
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,559
deselect everything

631
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
click on the white don't click on the

632
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,240
rocket click on the white object beneath

633
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
the rocket and go to path

634
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,480
stroke to path path break apart

635
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,840
ungroup and go to path

636
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,760
union and now i'm going to hold shift

637
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
click on the jet stream and go to path

638
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,080
difference and then path break apart

639
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,760
click off it to deselect we can get rid

640
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
of these objects now just press delete

641
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
on the keyboard to get rid of them

642
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,679
zoom back out and as you can see we are

643
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,880
finished we have created

644
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,919
our rocket logo design with inkscape if

645
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,200
you want now you can go ahead and add

646
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
some text if you'd like otherwise you

647
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
can just export this design and use it

648
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,679
as you'd like so

649
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,960
