00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,960
this is nick with logosbynick.com and in

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,240
you can create these isometric

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,440
illustrations

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
using inkscape and this is a topic that

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,039
i've gone over in the past however

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,560
thanks to some of the newer features in

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
inkscape version 1.0

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
it now makes it easier to make your

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
designs have rounded corners

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
as you can see in my example design here

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,359
so that is one of the things i will be

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
going over in this tutorial

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,479
but before we get started if you'd like

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
to learn more about how inkscape works

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
be sure to check out my inkscape master

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,480
class

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
it's a collection of over 60 videos

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,239
where i go over every tool and feature

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,239
in inkscape and i explain what it is and

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,600
demonstrate how it works

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,719
i'll have a link in the description of

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
the video if you want to check that out

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,239
so the first thing we want to do when we

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
have inkscape open here is set up our

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
document so that we are all working with

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
a similar view and layout so i'll come

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,079
over here to where it says

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,960
view make sure we have custom selected

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
come up here to where it says zoom i'm

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
going to zoom in at one to one

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
you're going to want to make sure you

34
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,120
have snapping enabled up here it should

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
be enabled by default but just make sure

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
it's enabled

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
and the snapping we want over here is

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
snap to cusp nodes

39
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
and then snap to grids which is over

40
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,320
here very important for this to be

41
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
enabled

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,280
so what i'm going to do now is set up

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
the isometric grid on the canvas i'll

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
come over here where it says file

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,759
go to document properties first i just

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,119
want to get rid of the page border i'm

47
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
going to click on this box right here

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
that says show page border to get that

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
out of the way when we're trying to

50
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
create our designs

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
and over here where it says grids let's

52
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
click on that tab i'm going to choose

53
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
axonometric grid

54
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,439
click new and for the grid units i'm

55
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
going to choose pixels

56
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
and if you notice we now have an

57
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880
isometric grid on the canvas here i just

58
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,320
want to make those lines a little more

59
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,759
spaced out because there's too many of

60
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,240
them

61
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
on the canvas as it is so where it says

62
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
spacing y

63
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,439
i'm just going to change that to 50 hit

64
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,159
enter there we go that's a good that's a

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
good happy medium right there so i'll go

66
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
ahead and close out of that

67
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
and when i'm drawing isometric designs

68
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,320
what i like to do is i like to start

69
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
with the smallest objects first and then

70
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
draw outwards to the largest objects

71
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
that way i can ensure that i don't run

72
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
out of boxes as i'm drawing

73
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,280
objects so what i want to do now is draw

74
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,959
the buttons of the phone first because

75
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
those are the smallest objects

76
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
what i'm going to be drawing is a a

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
phone laying flat on a surface

78
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
like that so let me grab

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
let me grab the bezier pen which is over

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
here

81
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,959
and if you notice the way the grid works

82
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,120
is every five lines you have a main line

83
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
which is slightly darker than the other

84
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,239
five lines so what i'd like to do is i

85
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,760
like to start at one of the main lines

86
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
right here

87
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
click to create a point bring the line

88
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,959
to the other main line right here

89
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
and over here then up back up here and

90
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
then back to the starting point

91
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
and this is going to be the home button

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
of the phone and this button is going to

93
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
have rounded corners but i'm going to go

94
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
back and add that later i'm going to

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
draw everything with sharp corners first

96
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,959
and then i'm going to go back and make

97
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
the corners rounded later so the next

98
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
biggest object for me to draw would be

99
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,280
the screen so

100
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
let me start out here the screen is

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
going to be over here represented by

102
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
this area

103
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
so i'm going to start five units away

104
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
from the button on the left side and one

105
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,480
unit up

106
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,879
like that and bring it the same distance

107
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
to the other side

108
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,760
using the main lines as a reference

109
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,519
and then i'm going to bring this out

110
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
here

111
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
one two three four now you know what i

112
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,280
missed that let me undo that by hitting

113
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
ctrl z

114
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
there we go it's pretty common to miss

115
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
the line you're going for so uh if you

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
if you end up missing the line just hit

117
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
ctrl z to undo it

118
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
or you can go back and edit it with the

119
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,599
nodes tool which i'll show you in a

120
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,319
minute so

121
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
let me bring this out here out here

122
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
about that much

123
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,879
up here and then back to the starting

124
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,840
point

125
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
now if you notice i totally missed the

126
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
mark there this line is not parallel to

127
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,720
this line right here so i'm going to

128
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,159
grab the nodes tool and fix that i'm

129
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
just going to put that back over here

130
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
where it should be

131
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
looks like i missed it by one let me try

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,200
that

133
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
to move around i'm just holding ctrl and

134
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
rolling up and down the mouse wheel and

135
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
then i'm pressing down the mouse wheel

136
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
and moving mouse

137
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
to to to move around like that looks

138
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
like i got to go one more like that

139
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
there we go that looks that looks right

140
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
so what i'm going to do now is

141
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
create the other button up top here or

142
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
actually the speaker the speaker hole

143
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
i'm just going to use this

144
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
duplicate this object so let me grab the

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
select tool click on this object

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
press ctrl d to duplicate it and then

147
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
click and drag this

148
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
up here right there

149
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
so what i'm going to draw now is the

150
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
outside edge of the phone so let me go

151
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
back to the bezier pen

152
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
and i'm going to start this one unit

153
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
away one unit away from the button here

154
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
and then down here

155
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
bring this out to about there that's

156
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
looking good

157
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
out here

158
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,360
and bring this one unit away from this

159
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
edge right here

160
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
and then back to the starting point now

161
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
i totally missed the mark there so let

162
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
me go back and edit that

163
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
let me grab the nodes tool this needs to

164
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
be

165
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
this needs to be right here okay that's

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
looking good

167
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
all right so what i'm going to do now is

168
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,320
i'm going to start rounding some of

169
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
these corners let me go to the select

170
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,160
tool

171
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,199
i'm going to start with the button right

172
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,120
here i'm going to click on that and i

173
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
want to open up the path effects menu

174
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
i'll go to path path effects

175
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
and i'm going to click to add a new path

176
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
effect this little plus button right

177
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
here

178
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
and i'm going to look for corners if you

179
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
can see i already have it typed in

180
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,720
because i was using this previously you

181
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
just type in corners

182
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
if you remove the search function the

183
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
search text it shows you all of the path

184
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,000
effects

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
if you just type in corners there you go

186
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,199
there's the path effect we're looking

187
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,479
for the corners

188
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520
fillet chamfer there we go

189
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
and what that's going to do is let me

190
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
zoom in on this if we grab the nodes

191
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,720
tool

192
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
you notice we have these four green

193
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,800
knots in the corners here

194
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
and you could take these knots and use

195
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
it to round to the corners like that

196
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,080
i don't just want to round to that one

197
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
corner though i want to round all of

198
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,479
these corners so i'm going to click and

199
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
drag over all four of those knots

200
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
and then just click in oops click and

201
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
drag this in like this to make these

202
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
rounded

203
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,039
and it looks like the snapping is

204
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,000
getting in the way so i'm going to

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
temporarily disable snapping

206
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
and then move this in like that

207
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,680
and now i can turn snapping back on you

208
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
know i'm going to leave it off because

209
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,680
we have to do the same thing to the

210
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
other buttons so

211
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
let me come back out here and do the

212
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
same thing to this speaker hole right

213
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,120
here

214
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
add a path effect corners

215
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
click and drag over all four points and

216
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,280
then just click and drag it inward like

217
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
that to give it rounded corners

218
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
over here there's four different

219
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
settings this is the fillet setting if

220
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
you choose like chamfer it's going to

221
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
give you a different style of corner if

222
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
you're getting this different style of

223
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
corner when you do this just make sure

224
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,600
you have fillet selected

225
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
it should be there by default but maybe

226
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
maybe it's not so that's how you can set

227
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,680
it back

228
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
if that's the case and now i want to

229
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
round the corners of the phone edge here

230
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
so to do that let me select that object

231
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
add a new path effect corners and for

232
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
this one i want to turn snapping back on

233
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,599
because i want to snap to one of these

234
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
grid lines i'm going to click and drag

235
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
this down

236
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,639
or you know what i have to select all

237
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,720
four of them let me click and drag over

238
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,199
all four of them

239
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
bring that in like that there we go

240
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,479
that's looking pretty good now that's

241
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
looking more like a phone

242
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
okay so let me uh let me go back to the

243
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,919
select tool

244
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,680
let's select over all of these objects

245
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,039
and convert them to paths we'll go to

246
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,919
path

247
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
object to path and that's going to

248
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
change that from a path effect to now

249
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
it's an actual

250
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
it's an actual path not just a path

251
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,479
effect if that makes any sense

252
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
the reason why i do that is because this

253
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
is this is sort of a new path effect and

254
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,639
it doesn't really

255
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
function uh the way it should sometimes

256
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
i'll there's sometimes i'm working with

257
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
this path effect and like the corners

258
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
will just randomly go back to being

259
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,919
sharp

260
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,520
and i'll have to go back and make them

261
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
rounded again that's why i like to

262
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
convert them to path beforehand so i

263
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
don't have to go back and do that so

264
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,919
let me now let's now take the button

265
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
here and just raise that to the top with

266
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
this button over here race

267
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
race selection to the top same thing

268
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
with the screen right here raise

269
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
selection to the top

270
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
nothing visually is happening on the

271
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
screen as you do this we're just doing

272
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,120
this so that

273
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
we have these objects layered above the

274
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
background which is the phone

275
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
edge here and i'll do the same thing to

276
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
this raise this to the top

277
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
and now i want to fill this in with some

278
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
color so i'm going to take this object

279
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,400
right here

280
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
and let's open up the fill and stroke

281
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
menu with this button over here

282
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
or you can press ctrl shift and f on the

283
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
keyboard

284
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
and i'm going to fill this in maybe with

285
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,879
like a light shade of gray like that

286
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,479
that's looking pretty good let's get rid

287
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
of the outline by holding shift and

288
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,479
clicking on the x over here

289
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,919
i might actually might want to make that

290
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,799
a little darker so i can see it better

291
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,159
and now i will do the same thing for

292
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
this button i'm going to make this maybe

293
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
a darker shade of gray

294
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
let me get rid of that outline by

295
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
holding shift and clicking the x

296
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,920
and i'll do the same thing over here i

297
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
want to make this the same color so i'm

298
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,720
just going to grab the dropper which is

299
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
over here and just select that

300
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
so it's the same color and then get rid

301
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
of the outline by holding shift and

302
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
clicking the x

303
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,680
and now i will grab the screen and i

304
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,200
guess i will make that

305
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
i guess i'll make that white for now let

306
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
me get rid of the

307
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,680
outline by shift-clicking the x like

308
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,959
that

309
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,640
and now what i want to do is i want to

310
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
give this phone a little bit of depth i

311
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
want to make it look like it's a

312
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
three-dimensional object so i'm gonna

313
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
i'm gonna duplicate this background over

314
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
here and move it down a little bit

315
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
so let me select the object right click

316
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
it and go to duplicate

317
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
then hold ctrl and move it down like

318
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
that and

319
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
drop it to the bottom over here where it

320
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
says lower selection to the bottom and i

321
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
want to make this the same color that

322
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,279
this object is over here so let me grab

323
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
the dropper tool

324
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,839
click on that and there we go

325
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
i actually might want to move this up a

326
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
little bit i don't want that much depth

327
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
that looks pretty good right there so if

328
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,120
you notice here

329
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
there's an empty space between the edges

330
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
of these two objects right here so we

331
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,440
want to add

332
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
lines right here to fill that in to make

333
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
it look to make it look the way it's

334
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
supposed to look

335
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
to do that maybe i should put this down

336
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
back to where it was to better

337
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,079
illustrate that

338
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,440
to better illustrate what i'm about to

339
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
do so i'm going to put that back to

340
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,920
where it was

341
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
i'm going to select both objects the

342
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,279
original background i'm going to hold

343
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
shift click the uh the new background we

344
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,920
just created and i'll go to extensions

345
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
generate from path and extrude

346
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
and i want to make sure we have polygon

347
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
selected and not lines and go ahead and

348
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
click apply

349
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
and that's going to create new objects

350
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
between the two objects we have selected

351
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
as you can see here

352
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,079
it created all of those objects so i

353
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
want to take this object that we just

354
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,240
created

355
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
and i want to ungroup that with this

356
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
button up here or ctrl shift ungroup

357
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
and i want to get rid of everything

358
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
except for these lines over

359
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
here that we just created so i'm going

360
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
to hold shift and click on that little

361
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
object right there to deselect it

362
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
come over here hold shift click on this

363
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
object to deselect that

364
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,519
and then press delete on the keyboard to

365
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
get rid of everything else

366
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,920
and now i can take this object hold

367
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
shift

368
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
take this object and then hold shift and

369
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
take the bottom object

370
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,360
and unify them all together by going to

371
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,560
path

372
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
union and as you can see now it looks

373
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
the way it's supposed to look

374
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,279
and if you temporarily disable let me

375
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,240
hold shift

376
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
if you hold shift and press three on the

377
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,440
keyboard it will temporarily disable

378
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
the grid on this on the screen so you

379
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
can see how it looks without the grid

380
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,760
getting in the way

381
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
i might want to take this screen and

382
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
make this darker like that there we go

383
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
now it's looking more like a phone

384
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
okay so the phone part of the design is

385
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
out of the way i'm now going to create

386
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
like a little uh

387
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
like a little chat bubble to go over the

388
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
uh the top of it here like i showed you

389
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,120
in the

390
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,040
the design of the thumbnail to put the

391
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
grid back to where it was

392
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
i'm just going to hold shift and press

393
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
three on the keyboard

394
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
or other or in other words you just use

395
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
the pound key which is

396
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
up here where it says view page grid

397
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
that's another way you can toggle that

398
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
off and on i just like to use the

399
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,360
keyboard shortcut so

400
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
let's create a chat bubble to go over

401
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,320
here now so i'm going to come over here

402
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
out of the way

403
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
i'm going to create three circles to

404
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
make it look like somebody's typing

405
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
so let me grab the bezier pen

406
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,079
start right there again i'm using the

407
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
main lines in increments of five to

408
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
create these

409
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
there we go i'm just going to duplicate

410
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
this

411
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,519
ctrl d move this over here so that it's

412
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,639
one unit apart

413
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
ctrl d so that it's one unit apart

414
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,399
and now i'm going to draw a box going

415
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
around these three that's two units

416
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
apart so let me go back to the bezier

417
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
pen

418
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,360
i want to start out two units away one

419
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
two

420
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
come up here like that one two

421
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,760
good over there

422
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,320
and then back to the starting point

423
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
let's see if that worked okay yeah it

424
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
looks like i got that right

425
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
all right so now what i will do is i

426
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
will round the corners of these objects

427
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,920
here so let me

428
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
grab the select tool let me select this

429
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
object

430
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,079
add a new path effect corners

431
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
go to the nodes tool select all of these

432
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
nodes right here

433
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,680
and then just click and drag them in

434
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
like that

435
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
let me turn off snapping so that i can

436
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
get these a little closer to each other

437
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
without them getting in the way

438
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
box over here

439
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,680
and now what i will do is i will do the

440
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,519
same thing to this object right here so

441
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
let me click on that

442
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,800
add a path effect rounded

443
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
and for this one i will turn snapping

444
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
back on

445
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,399
maybe right about there that looks

446
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,480
pretty good so now i want to grab the

447
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
select tool

448
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
click and drag over all of these convert

449
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
these to pads by going to path

450
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,079
object to path and now i'm going to

451
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
create a little point down here on the

452
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,199
bottom to make it look like a speech

453
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:13,920
bubble

454
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
so let me grab the bezier pen again i'm

455
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
going to come in over here a little bit

456
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
bring this down to about here

457
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
and then bring this across over here

458
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
this is the only line we're drawing

459
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
that's not going according to the grid

460
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
so i'm going to bring this up here like

461
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
that maybe over here that looks good

462
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
and then back to the starting point and

463
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
now we can grab the select tool and

464
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
unify those two together by holding

465
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
shift

466
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
and clicking on the object next to it

467
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,839
and go to path

468
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
union and now it's one shape like a

469
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,120
speech bubble

470
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,959
now much like we did with the phone and

471
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,320
the three-dimensional

472
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
drop here i want to do the same thing

473
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,600
only going that way so

474
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
let me take this object first i want to

475
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
color this in actually

476
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,240
let's take these three circles right

477
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
here select those all raise those to the

478
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,959
top

479
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
and then fill them in with white

480
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,560
nothing's going to visually change on

481
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
the canvas because the canvas background

482
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,760
is white so you have a white object

483
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
against a white background so it doesn't

484
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
look like it's there but there is a

485
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
white fill there

486
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
let me get rid of the outline by holding

487
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,519
shift and pressing x

488
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,680
over here in the bottom left corner and

489
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
then i'll take this and i'll make this

490
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
something like

491
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
blue or green or yellow or whatever

492
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
whatever color you want to make it

493
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
i'll just use that color blue get rid of

494
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
the outline

495
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
shift clicking the x and let me

496
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,519
duplicate this by pressing ctrl d

497
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
and i will make this one a little darker

498
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
like that

499
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
maybe even use an off shade of blue like

500
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
that

501
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
bring this out here send that to the

502
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,920
bottom this button over here lower

503
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
selection to the bottom

504
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,399
there we go and now i want to extrude

505
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
these two together so let me hold shift

506
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
and click on both of those

507
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
and go to extensions generate from path

508
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,120
extrude and click apply

509
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,560
and then just give it a minute to do its

510
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,399
thing when i was doing this tutorial

511
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,920
setting it up before it took a while for

512
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,480
this to

513
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
load but this time it went nice and

514
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
quick so that's good let me close out of

515
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
that

516
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
we now have this object that we're

517
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,399
looking for let me ungroup that with the

518
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,959
ungroup button

519
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
and again i want to keep this object

520
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
over here that's connecting these two

521
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,040
points together i want to keep this

522
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
object over here

523
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,079
and i want to keep this object over here

524
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,440
and i want to delete the rest of them so

525
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,480
i'll hold shift

526
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
click that object to deselect it hold

527
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,519
shift

528
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,440
click that object to deselect it and

529
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
then come over here hold shift

530
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
click that object deselect it and all we

531
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
have selected now are the objects we

532
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
want to get rid of so now you can press

533
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
delete on the keyboard and there you go

534
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
so let's take these objects right here

535
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
that we just created shift click each of

536
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
them so we have all three selected

537
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,519
and then hold shift and click the

538
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,079
original and go to path

539
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,320
union and that's exactly what we're

540
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
looking for right there a three

541
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
dimensional

542
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,519
a 3d style isometric chat bubble

543
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
like that so what i want to do now is

544
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
place this over to design over the

545
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,600
design so

546
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
i'm going to get rid of i'm going to

547
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
temporarily get rid of the

548
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,480
isometric grid because we don't need it

549
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
anymore we're done drawing objects so

550
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
let me hold shift and press three on the

551
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
keyboard to get rid of that

552
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
let me disable snapping for now so that

553
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,119
doesn't get in the way

554
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,799
click and drag over this whole thing and

555
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,160
press ctrl g

556
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
on the keyboard and place it over the

557
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
object over here like that

558
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
ctrl shift to scale it down and then you

559
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
can take this duplicate it bring it over

560
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,599
here

561
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
and if you want you can make this a

562
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,919
different color

563
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
ungroup it i'll make this yellow

564
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,039
make this also yellow but maybe an off

565
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,520
shade

566
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,799
maybe like red like that

567
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,880
and then finally you could take this you

568
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
could put like a little drop shadow down

569
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
here by duplicating this object

570
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,360
i'm actually going to duplicate both of

571
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
these objects the light gray hold

572
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
shift and the dark gray ctrl d to

573
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,799
duplicate

574
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
path union unify them together make this

575
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
black

576
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
hold ctrl and just click and drag this

577
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,320
down like that send that to the bottom

578
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
that looks pretty good and bring the

579
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
opacity of this down

580
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
like that so we have a little bit of a

581
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
shadow there it would look a little more

582
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
convincing if this were a different

583
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
color which i think i'll do that now

584
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
i'll make this

585
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
i'll make this something like purple

586
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
i'll make this a lighter shade of that

587
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
purple

588
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,039
and then i'll make these ones white

589
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,039
or you know what and i'll use the same

590
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,400
shade as that purple

591
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
and then this i'll make this a darker

592
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,919
purple as well i'm just using the

593
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,600
keyboard shortcuts to toggle back and

594
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
forth between the dropper the dropper

595
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,520
tool is

596
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,039
the letter d on the keyboard and the

597
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,720
select tool is s

598
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
so i just like to toggle back and forth

599
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
between those let me make that little

600
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
darker

601
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
that's looking good maybe add some more

602
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,120
saturation to that

603
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
that right there is what i'm looking for

604
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,039
come over here make this now i can make

605
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,240
this a little darker so it's a little

606
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,080
more convincing

607
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
and i'd say that looks good enough so i

608
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,799
think that should do it for this

609
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,160
tutorial that's how you can go about

610
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,520
creating these simple

611
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,559
isometric drawings with rounded corners

612
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
using some of the new features in

613
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
inkscape version 1.0

614
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
