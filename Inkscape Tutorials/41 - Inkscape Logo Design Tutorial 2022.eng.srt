1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,719
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,639
you can create this mountain range logo

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:05,560
with the winding River using nothing but

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,080
simple shapes in inkscape I should

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,360
mention though that this tutorial is

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,000
going to be more of an intermediate to

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Advanced tutorial and that I'm not going

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,599
to be going over every single step in

9
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,080
excruciating detail so if you're Vaguely

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,439
Familiar with how the tools work in

11
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:19,800
inkscape then you should be able to

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,279
follow along with this tutorial

13
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,680
otherwise sit back and enjoy what

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,320
inkscape can do

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,640
[Music]

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,120
so to get us started here in inkscape

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,680
let's start out by making sure we are

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,879
working with a similar layout by coming

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,160
up here to where it says View and having

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,559
WID screen disabled now for some reason

21
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,879
I think some of the newer versions of

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
inkscape automatically start out in

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,360
widescreen mode so if you have that

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,199
enabled just go ahead and disable that

25
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,960
and your layout should look the same as

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,359
mine here on the screen so the first

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,719
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

28
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,600
create the shape or the emblem for the

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,239
logo and I'm going to use the stars and

30
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,320
polygons tool for that I'm going to use

31
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,920
the polygon setting with all of these

32
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,119
input values here and I'm going to click

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,080
and drag upward with my mouse on the

34
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,720
canvas while holding control and shift

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,240
so I can get a six-sided shape like that

36
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,759
where the points go vertically up and

37
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,000
down as you can see there let me make

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,960
that a little

39
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,720
larger okay I'm going to grab my

40
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,640
selection tool move this up towards the

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,520
center of the page a little more and I'm

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
going to convert this to a path by going

43
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
to path object to path and then I'm

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
going to grab the edit paths by nodes

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
tool and I want to take these two nodes

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,840
right here and I'm going to enable the

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,479
transformation handles and I'm just

48
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,159
going to scale these nodes down a little

49
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,799
bit like

50
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,920
that okay then I'm going to take these

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,040
nodes over here and I'm going to scale

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
these down like that I'm holding control

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
and shift while I do this to lock the

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
the uh aspect ratio and then I'm going

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
to move these nodes up like that and now

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
we're starting to get the shape of our

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
emblem I may even pull this out a little

58
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,719
bit you may have to tweak this a little

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,640
bit just to get it how you like it that

60
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,799
right there is about what I'm going for

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
so I'm going to leave it as it is

62
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm going to turn off my transformation

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,200
handles and then grab the selection tool

64
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,799
and let me open up the fill and stroke

65
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,399
menu which is located over here and I

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,080
will bring down the opacity of this a

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
little bit so I could see through the

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
object as I'm working with it so what I

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,959
want to do now is round off the corners

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
here and to make these Corners rounded

71
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm going to use a path effect for that

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,519
so I'll come up here to where it says

73
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,720
path choose path effects click the plus

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
icon down here to add new path effect

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
and the path effect I am looking for is

76
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,239
Corners so I'm just going to type in

77
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,879
corners and there it is the corners path

78
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,640
effect I'm going to grab the nodes tool

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm going to click and drag over all of

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,319
the nodes right here and I'm going to

81
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,680
pull down one of these green handles to

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
make these Corners rounded and you can't

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
really see it happening as it happens

84
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
probably not on my screen but if you see

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,519
on your screen there should be a blue

86
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,159
outline indicating the degree to which

87
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,519
the corners are being rounded right

88
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,400
there and if you release the click you

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
could see now we have some rounded

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,159
Corners there which is what I'm going

91
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,920
for now I want this top half of the the

92
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,400
design to be completely rounded so what

93
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,599
I'm going to do is I'm going to deselect

94
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,440
these nodes and I'm going to take just

95
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,519
this node right here oops click the

96
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,080
wrong thing I'm going to take just this

97
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,239
node right here and I'm going to bring

98
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,080
this all the way down like that so we

99
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
end up with something like that right

100
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
there and now I will finalize this by

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,519
going to path object to path press one

102
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,239
to zoom back out to

103
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,239
100% and maybe even let me just make

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,879
this a little a little uh add a little

105
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,200
more vertical height to it like that

106
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,640
this is just a personal preference I'm

107
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,319
just eyeballing this as I go along okay

108
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,159
that's looking good right there so now

109
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,599
I'm going to create some Mountains for

110
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,480
the background here to create the

111
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,640
mountains I'm going to use the squares

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
and rectangles tool I'm going to click

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,959
and drag I'm going to hold control and

114
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,239
shift while clicking and dragging to

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,200
create a perfectly symmetrical square

116
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,799
like that and I want to give this

117
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,040
rounded Corners a little bit I'm going

118
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
to make these Corners a little rounded

119
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,159
like that not much just a little bit and

120
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,519
then I will grab the selection tool and

121
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,640
rotate this around like that I'm going

122
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,519
to hold control while rotating so we get

123
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
it nice and vertical like that and I'm

124
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,480
going to give this a different color

125
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,000
just so I could differentiate it up

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,879
against the emblem over here I'm going

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
to duplicate this a few times to make

128
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
some mountains in the background so I'm

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
going to press control D to duplicate

130
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,238
I'll put this one up here control

131
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,120
duplicate again put this one down here

132
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,880
and then another copy over here and

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,520
that's about what I'm going for right

134
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,880
there so I'm going to shift click all of

135
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,479
these so I have them all

136
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,960
selected and I will unify them all Al

137
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,039
together by going to path

138
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,320
Union and now I'm going to take a

139
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
duplicate of the emblem here I'm going

140
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,479
to select the emblem control D to

141
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,759
duplicate it hold shift click on this

142
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,880
shape and we're going to take the

143
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,400
intersecting area here by going to path

144
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,039
and selecting

145
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,039
intersection and now I'm going to add a

146
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,080
little bit of a uh a shadow effect to

147
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,479
the corners of these mountains here let

148
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,120
me grab the pen tool let me enable

149
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
snapping and then I'm going to snap to

150
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,440
this corner right here to create a point

151
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm going to hold control and bring this

152
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
line I'm going to bring this line down

153
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
to the right to make sure it's parallel

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
with this line right here this angle of

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,120
this mountain I'm going to bring it the

156
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,919
opposite way like that then click and

157
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll bring this one up here I'm letting

158
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,880
go of control at this point I'll bring

159
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,680
this one up here click again and then

160
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,199
back to the starting

161
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
point okay so I had a little technical

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
difficulty there I had to redo that one

163
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,800
okay let me grab a duplicate of this

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,919
copy now contrl D put this over here put

165
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,800
this one over here

166
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,280
and there we go now I want to shift

167
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,560
click all of these to select them unify

168
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,240
them together path Union and then

169
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,639
subtract them from the mountains hold

170
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,440
shift click on the mountains path

171
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
difference and there we go that right

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,280
there is the effect I'm going for okay

173
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,759
so now I'm going to create I'm going to

174
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,319
create a little winding River to place

175
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,560
right here in the Forefront of the uh

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
design here so let me turn off snapping

177
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,840
first let me grab the pen tool and for

178
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,800
this we're going to get a little

179
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,919
creative I'm going to create just one

180
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,319
vertical line like this I'm going to

181
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
click once to create a point hold

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
control put this line down here like

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
that click again and press enter and

184
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
grab the nodes tool and give this line a

185
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,039
little bit of a curve I'm going to

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
select these handles over here and curve

187
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,240
this out like

188
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
that there we go grab the selection tool

189
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
and duplicate this and I want to

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,639
position this in such a way that the

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,440
space between the two lines represents

192
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
the shape kind of like a winding River

193
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,319
now we're going to change the

194
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,680
perspective of this to make it look like

195
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,240
it's actually part of the landscape here

196
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,639
but for now we're just trying to get

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,039
this this shape right here between these

198
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,560
two lines and once you have that shape

199
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,919
like that select both of them convert

200
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,919
these Strokes to a path path stroke to

201
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,440
path and then unify them together go to

202
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,759
path Union and now break them apart by

203
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,639
going to path break apart and now if I

204
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,120
click off of that to deselect it you can

205
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,440
see this has been broken up into

206
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,599
separate pieces and I want this piece

207
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,120
over here I'm G to press delete on the

208
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,080
keyboard to get rid of that and we're

209
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,319
looking for this piece right here this

210
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,240
is what we want to work with so let me

211
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
go back to my fill and stroke menu and

212
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,319
bring down the opacity of this a little

213
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
bit so I can see it better I'm going to

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,840
place this over here and now I'm just

215
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,560
going to use the transformation handles

216
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,160
to uh scale and Shear this as needed I'm

217
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
just going to make this shorter like

218
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,800
that maybe even scale this

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,960
up like that there we

220
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,520
go maybe even make this a little wider

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,400
so that it stretches out more across the

222
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,039
design okay that looks

223
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,319
good and if you really want to sell this

224
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,039
effect you can use the perspective path

225
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,160
effects so let me come over here to the

226
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,319
path effects menu let me add A New Path

227
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,160
effect and for this one I'm looking for

228
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,639
perspective envelope so I'm going to

229
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,960
type in PR RS and there it is

230
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,120
perspective and now down here where it

231
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
says type make sure you have perspective

232
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,960
enabled and I'm going to enable this one

233
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,319
right here that says mirror movements

234
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,360
and vertical and now I can grab the

235
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,000
nodes tool and I should be able to take

236
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,759
these two right here and bring this up

237
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,360
like that and as you can see we're

238
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,319
changing the perspective of this River

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
here to make it look like it's uh

240
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,639
disappearing into the vantage point

241
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,639
there now I'm going to convert that to a

242
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,080
path by going to path object to path

243
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
make that a little bit bigger so that it

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
stretches Out Among the bottom of the

245
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
design

246
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,599
here and now I will fit that into the

247
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:23,000
emblem I may even make this a little bit

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
whoops I may even make this a little bit

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,080
um wider like that I want the start of

250
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,159
this to be closer to this corner right

251
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,360
here so that looks good as it is I'm

252
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
going to leave that I'm going to take

253
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,839
this emblem shape right here control D

254
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,080
to duplicate it shift click the river

255
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,679
and go to path intersection and there we

256
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,160
go now we have that right there okay so

257
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,399
let's create a little pine tree to put

258
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,839
right here in the Forefront of the

259
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,680
design to do that I'm going to grab the

260
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,200
squares and rectangles tool I want to

261
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
make make sure I have sharp

262
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,240
Corners click and drag to create a

263
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
square like that convert it to a path

264
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
again make sure you have sharp Corners

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
here path object to path grab the nodes

266
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
tool I'm going to delete this node right

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,160
here by pressing delete on the keyboard

268
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
and then I'll take these nodes over here

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,880
and I'll make those Corners sharp like

270
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
that and now I can grab the selection

271
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,760
tool and rotate this back around while

272
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
holding control so we lock it onto 15°

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
angles like that we want this nice and

274
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,200
flat and upright and I'm just going to

275
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,399
make this a little narrower I'll

276
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,680
duplicate that bring this one down here

277
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
make this one a little

278
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,959
bigger and then I'll duplicate that and

279
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,320
I'll bring this one down here and make

280
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
that one a little bigger like that I

281
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,120
should probably be using darker colors

282
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
so you can see this better let me go

283
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
with blue there we

284
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
go and there we go I think that right

285
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,279
there looks good so I'm going to use

286
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,240
that as it is I'm going to select all of

287
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,079
those path Union and there we go there's

288
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,920
our tree so let me scale this down and

289
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,440
place this at the front of the design

290
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
over

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
here I may even place

292
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,000
this I think right about here would be

293
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,680
good I want this to be I want the tip of

294
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,760
this tree to go to the the edge of the

295
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,440
river right here whoops what happened

296
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
okay there we

297
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,839
go I'm going to place that right about

298
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,760
there okay that's good enough so let me

299
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,040
duplicate the emblem and take the

300
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,720
intersecting area there

301
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,640
intersection and let me give this thing

302
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,800
some color so we could start

303
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
differentiating the elements here let me

304
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,480
select everything we can now bring the

305
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,120
opacity up and start adding in some

306
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,560
color so I want the mountain range here

307
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,200
to be a dark shade of blue actually I'm

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
want to start with the background here I

309
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
want the background to be a light shade

310
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,279
of blue I'm going to start with uh that

311
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,560
shade right there maybe that and then

312
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,959
I'll take this and I'll make this a dark

313
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,920
blue like that and I want the tree to be

314
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
that same dark shade of blue so I'm

315
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
going to grab the dropper tool which is

316
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,240
located over here I just like to use the

317
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,120
letter d on the keyboard D for dropper

318
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,160
it's easy to remember and there you go

319
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
and S for selection back to the

320
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,560
selection tool grab the uh the river

321
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,639
here I'm going to make this the same

322
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,079
color as this right here D for the

323
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,600
dropper s for selection there we go and

324
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,040
now I'm going to place us a sun a little

325
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
bit of uh sunrays in the background here

326
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
so let me grab these circles and

327
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,839
ellipses tool click and drag to create a

328
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,800
perfectly round circle like that place

329
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,079
it in the center of the design I'm going

330
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,639
to make this white so we can see it

331
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,680
better and that's actually the color I'm

332
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
going to use for the Sun so let me

333
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Center this up I'm going to shift click

334
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,320
both of these open up the aligned

335
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
distribute menu which is over here we

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,279
can press control shift and to access

337
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,639
that and from the relative two I want

338
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,200
last selected chosen I'm just going to

339
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,399
Center that up on the vertical axis like

340
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,000
that now let me make this a little bit

341
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,360
bigger and I'm going to lower this down

342
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
beneath the mountains now you can lower

343
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,560
you can raise and lower objects using

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,200
these buttons I just like to use the

345
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,680
page up and page down keys on the

346
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,560
keyboard so I'm going to press page down

347
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,360
to lower that there we go and now I'm

348
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,639
going to make a duplicate copy of this

349
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm going to press controll D I'm going

350
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,959
to make this one

351
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,760
bigger there here we go and I'm going to

352
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,240
make this one a lighter shade of blue

353
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
again pressing D on the keyboard to grab

354
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,399
the dropper grab the uh fill and stroke

355
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,480
menu make this one a lot lighter oops

356
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,079
and then I'll just take this and page

357
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,040
down and lower it beneath like that and

358
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,920
I'll maybe even make that one a little

359
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,720
darker okay there we go now I'm going to

360
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,959
duplicate this circle again controll D

361
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
I'll make this one a little

362
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,560
darker maybe even add a little more blue

363
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,480
into it like that and I'll make this

364
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,680
larger and I'm going to lower this down

365
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,880
by pressing page the the page down key

366
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
like

367
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,800
that there we go I'm going to make this

368
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,399
about this big and then I'll make this

369
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,560
one about this

370
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,639
big and at this point we're just trying

371
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,279
to size things up to make sure it fits

372
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,160
nicely and then I'm going to make this

373
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,720
emblem I want this to be a darker shade

374
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,519
of blue than this so let me press D on

375
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,680
the keyboard to grab the dropper and

376
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll make this one a little darker

377
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,120
okay that looks better now I'm going to

378
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,560
update the river color to match this

379
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,120
shade of blue right here so let me just

380
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
grab the dropper and do that and now I'm

381
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,839
going to take the intersecting area of

382
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,160
this circle right here so let me grab

383
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,839
the emblem and duplicate that shift

384
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,399
click the circle path

385
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,240
intersection there we go and as you can

386
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
see the design is coming together here

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,000
the one final last step would be to add

388
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,360
a little bit of a white border going

389
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,440
around the outside and a drop shadow

390
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,959
beneath it so it really pops off the

391
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,199
page so to do that let me select just

392
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,720
the emblem right here and go to path and

393
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,120
choose uh linked

394
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,639
offset and I want to make this offset a

395
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,160
totally different color so we can see it

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
better I'm going to choose red I'm going

397
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,959
to grab the node tool and there should

398
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,480
be this little node up top over here and

399
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,839
you should be able to grab this and pull

400
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,440
this out like that and I want the border

401
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,959
of this emblem to be about about that

402
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,399
big I can finalize that by going to path

403
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,199
object to path and then I will make that

404
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,639
white grab the selection tool and now

405
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,160
I'm going to duplicate that by pressing

406
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,680
control D and I'm going to make this one

407
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,560
black and now I can use my page down key

408
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
to lower that down and then I can use my

409
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,880
arrow keys to bring this down a little

410
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
bit there we go I'll give that a blur

411
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,360
and I'll bring down the opacity of that

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
blur like that and now I'll have to

413
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
deselect it and select it again and now

414
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,800
I can use my arrow keys to move that

415
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
down a little bit just to give a little

416
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
bit of

417
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
offset okay there we go and I think that

418
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,279
should do it for this lesson that is how

419
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
you can go about creating a mountain

420
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,759
range logo with a winding River and a

421
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,759
pine tree and a rising sun coming up

422
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,959
beneath it inside of this element using

423
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,000
nothing but simple shapes in inkscape

424
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,560
before I end this video if you found

425
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,079
this lesson useful then consider

426
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,680
checking out my inkscape master class

427
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,560
it's a collection of over 60 videos

428
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
where I go over all of the tools and

429
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,279
features in inkscape and I explain what

430
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,600
they are and Demon demonstrate how they

431
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,279
work kind of like how I did in this

432
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,320
video we even have a private Community

433
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
where you can ask questions and get help

434
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,759
from me anytime you want and best of all

435
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,519
there's no monthly membership fees you

436
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,560
just pay $17 one time and you're in for

437
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
Life I'll have some information about

438
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
that in the description of the video if

439
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,639
you want to check that out as always

440
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,079
thanks for watching
