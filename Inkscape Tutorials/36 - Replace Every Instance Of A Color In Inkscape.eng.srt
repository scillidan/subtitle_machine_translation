1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,040
so let's go over how you can use

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,620
inkscape to replace every instance of a

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,319
single color on a document all at once

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,540
if you see from my example design here I

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,099
have this assortment of objects in a

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,019
variety of colors let's say I want to

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,820
take every object with this salmon color

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
right here and change it to a yellow

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,140
shade normally to do that I would have

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,300
to click on each object individually and

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,340
change the colors one by one which can

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,199
be a pretty tedious and time-consuming

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
task depending on the size of your

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
artwork

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,580
there is an easier way to go about doing

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,679
this in inkscape though in order to do

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,820
this what I'm going to first do is I'm

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,380
going to click on one object right here

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,480
that contains the color that I'd like to

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,700
change with the object selected I'm

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,379
going to come up to the edit menu I'll

22
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,600
go down to select same and in this menu

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,860
over here to the right you should see

24
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,600
all of these different attributes that

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
you can choose to select your objects by

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
so for example if I choose to select my

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,780
objects by fill color

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,940
it's going to select every single object

29
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,800
on my document that contains that fill

30
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,719
color of the one object I have selected

31
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,120
and to change that color now all I have

32
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,920
to do is apply a different shade like

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,899
that and as you can see every single

34
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,400
color has been replaced with the color

35
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,460
that I chose there now this example here

36
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,320
contains several colors so I'll have to

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,820
repeat this process a couple of more

38
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,500
times I'm going to select this object up

39
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,740
here I'll go to edit select same and if

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,119
you look over here you can see all of

41
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,439
these different properties that you can

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,060
use to select your objects by you could

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,979
select by fill and stroke not just the

44
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,780
fill you can select by just the fill

45
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,060
color just the stroke color just the

46
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,520
stroke style and by object type whether

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,619
it be a square or a circle or even a

48
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,600
custom drawn path with the bezier pen

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm just going to use fill color for

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,840
this demonstration and I'm going to

51
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,220
change that to a lighter shade of yellow

52
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,380
and then I'll change this color of this

53
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,479
object right here I'll go to edit select

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,500
same

55
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,060
fill color

56
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,220
and I'll change this to a darker shade

57
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,600
of yellow maybe something a little off

58
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,659
like orange add a little orange in there

59
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,460
okay that looks good

60
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,200
and now we are finished as you can see

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,659
it's as simple as changing colors

62
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,759
globally on your document is as simple

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,619
as selecting the one object that

64
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,600
contains that color and then using the

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
edit menu to select every other object

66
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,719
so that is how you can go about

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,060
performing a color replace using

68
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,700
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

69
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
then consider checking out my inkscape

70
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,720
master class it's a collection of over

71
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,640
60 videos where I go over all of the

72
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,500
tools and features in inkscape and I

73
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,060
explain what they are and demonstrate

74
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,980
how they work kind of like how I did in

75
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,020
this video we even have a private

76
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,520
Community where you can ask questions

77
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
and get help from me anytime you want

78
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,780
and best of all there's no monthly

79
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,780
membership fees you just pay 17 one time

80
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,879
and you're in for Life I'll have some

81
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,319
information about that down below if you

82
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,180
want to check that out as always thanks
