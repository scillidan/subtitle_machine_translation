1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
in this tutorial I'll be going over how

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,120
you can use the transform tool in

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,319
inkscape I'll first be going over a

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,000
quick demonstration of what it is and

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,559
how it works and then I'll show you an

6
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:10,880
example of how to create something

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,320
interesting with it like I've done here

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
with this spiraling hexagon design

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
before we get started though if you want

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,359
to learn more about how inkscape Works

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,320
be sure to check out my inkscape master

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
class it's a collection of over 80

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,119
videos where we go over all of the tools

14
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,119
and features in inkscape and I explain

15
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,519
what they are and demonstrate how they

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,119
work kind of like how I'm doing in this

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,359
video we even have a private Community

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,880
where you can ask questions and get help

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
from me anytime you want I'll have some

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,120
information about that down below in the

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
description if you want to check that

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,040
out and with that out of the way let's

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,360
get started so I have this example

24
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,640
graphic placed on my document here and

25
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm going to open up the transform menu

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
by going to object and selecting

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
transform and it should open up over

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,160
here on the right hand side of your

29
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,760
screen now what the transform tool does

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
is it allows you to make basic

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,760
transformations to objects that you

32
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,199
would normally make with the selection

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,079
tool only it allows you to do it using

34
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,359
numerical values so if you come over

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,159
here to the top you can see these tabs

36
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,439
we have these different options for

37
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,840
moving scaling rotating skewing and

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,759
Matrix we're going to ignore the Matrix

39
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,000
one for this demonstration I'm just

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,159
going to show you how these other ones

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
work so let's say I have this object on

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,920
my page and I want to move it over a

43
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,000
certain number of pixels you can

44
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,720
normally move objects by just clicking

45
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,079
and dragging but the problem with doing

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,400
it that way is that you don't get a

47
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
precise movement let's say I wanted to

48
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,960
move this over exactly 50 pixels I can

49
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,560
can come over here to the horizontal

50
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
input and type in 50 and then come down

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
here and click apply and you can see it

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
moves the object over 50 pixels so let

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,079
me undo what I just did right there let

54
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,000
me reset this value and now I'll show

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,680
you how scale works scale is useful

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,240
because normally when you want to scale

57
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
an object by a certain numerical value

58
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,680
you would use the width and height

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,799
inputs in the toolbar up top so if I

60
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,960
wanted to scale this down to 400 pixels

61
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,280
wide I would type that in and press

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,560
enter and you can see it scales it down

63
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,799
but the the problem with using this

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
approach is that it takes the object off

65
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
of the center of its axis so if you

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
notice the object is no longer in the

67
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,038
center of my document it now went to the

68
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,800
top left because with these inputs up

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
here it scales the object from the

70
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,080
bottom right to the top left now if I

71
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,599
undo that it'll put it back in the

72
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,640
center the benefit of using the

73
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,519
transform tool is that it allows you to

74
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,599
scale the object using the numerical

75
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,720
value directly from the center and you

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
can also use a percentage value as well

77
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
now if you want to use pixels you can go

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,879
ahead and select pixels but for this

79
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,840
demonstration I'll just use percentages

80
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,519
and I'm just going to type in well first

81
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm going to select scale

82
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
proportionately so it scales both

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
dimensions and I'm going to scale this

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,040
down by

85
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,640
50% and I will click apply and you can

86
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,360
see what happens it scales the object

87
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
down exactly in the center so that it

88
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,280
doesn't lose its alignment on the

89
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
page now let's go over the rotate tab

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,319
normally when you want to rotate an

91
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,360
object you can click on it to select it

92
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,879
click on it again to get the rotation

93
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,840
handles and you can rotate it around

94
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
freeh hands like that or you can hold

95
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
the control key and lock it to 15 degree

96
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,080
increments the problem with using this

97
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
approach is that you don't get an exact

98
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,640
rotation so let's say you wanted to

99
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,200
rotate your object by a specific

100
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
numerical value like 26° or some kind of

101
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,560
random number you would normally have to

102
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,159
click and drag like this and look

103
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,239
towards the bottom of the screen to see

104
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,840
the Angles and hope that you can release

105
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,440
the click exactly where you need it to

106
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,360
be or you can just use the rotation tool

107
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
so I can come over here and type in let

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
me just replace this value type in 26

109
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,319
and you can choose whether to rotate it

110
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,360
clockwise or counterclockwise and then

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,480
click apply and you can see it rotated

112
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,599
the object 26° and the way the transform

113
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,840
tool works is this is all cumulative so

114
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
if I keep clicking apply over and over

115
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,239
again it'll rotate it

116
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,879
26° relative to its previous position so

117
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,879
I can keep rotating this indefinitely

118
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,120
like that and you get the

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
idea now let's go over how you can

120
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
create that spiraling hexagon design

121
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
that I showed you at the beginning of

122
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
the video I'm going to grab my stars and

123
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,760
polygons tool over here and the settings

124
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,519
I want to use are polygon I want six

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,840
corners and rounded and randomize both

126
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,480
set to zero and then I'm going to click

127
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,920
and drag on the canvas and then hold

128
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,519
control and shift and click and drag so

129
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,079
that we get a nice uh upright hexagon

130
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,120
like that you can rotate it around to

131
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,358
make sure that the corners are going

132
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,120
perfectly up and down vertically like

133
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,440
that and I'm going to grab my selection

134
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
tool and I first want to Center this on

135
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
the page so I will come over here to

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
object and I will choose a line

137
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,120
distribute and I'm going to choose page

138
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,840
from the relative to dropdown and I'm

139
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
going to Center this up on the page and

140
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
then I'm going to zoom in and I'm going

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
to hold control and shift and scale this

142
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
down to make it really small we want

143
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,479
this object to be pretty small and I'm

144
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,120
going to remove the fill color by

145
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,000
clicking the Red X down here and I'm

146
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,720
going to apply a black Stroke by holding

147
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,759
the shift key and pressing the color

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
black next to that uh number right there

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
or next to that red X and now I want to

150
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
make sure that this stroke is one pixel

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
so I'll open open up my fill and stroke

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,800
menu by double clicking this stroke box

153
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
down here and I'll come over here to the

154
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,720
stroke style Tab and I'm going to size

155
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,199
this at one pixel and I want to make

156
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,120
sure that the join has sharp corners and

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
then I want to come up here to this

158
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
setting in the toolbar that says when

159
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,479
scaling objects scale the stroke width

160
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,319
by the same proportion I want to make

161
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,280
sure that that is enabled and now what

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,199
I'm going to do is I'm going to come

163
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,160
over here to my transform tool and I'm

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
going to use two different

165
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Transformations I'm first going to scale

166
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
it by 110% and then I'm going to rotate

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,680
it by 10° but before I do that I want to

168
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,240
make a duplicate copy so this is the

169
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,880
original copy I'm going to make a

170
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,039
duplicate by either right clicking it

171
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,759
and going to duplicate or just pressing

172
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,039
command D or controll D and when you

173
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,680
press that you'll have a duplicate copy

174
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
there and once you do that come over

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,440
here to the scale tab let's scale this

176
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
we'll first of all enable scale

177
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,639
proportionately and we're going to scale

178
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,120
this by

179
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,280
110° or 110% and click apply and then

180
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,400
we'll come over here to rotate we're

181
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,199
going to rotate this by 10° so let me

182
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,199
replate this replace this with 10 and

183
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,960
there we go and now I'm just going to

184
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,240
repeat that process over and over until

185
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
we get the intended effect so I'm going

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
to press command D again to duplicate

187
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,080
the object and I will rotate it and then

188
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,160
come over here and scale it and then I

189
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,759
will do that again press control D to

190
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,919
duplicate scale it and then rotate it

191
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,599
and then do the same thing control D to

192
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,440
duplicate rotate it scale it and you can

193
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,960
see that the design is starting to come

194
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
together as I do this so I'm going to

195
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,520
duplicate this a bunch of times and

196
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,120
apply these Transformations and then I

197
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,919
will catch up with you when I'm all

198
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
done and you can make as many copies as

199
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
you want I made this many right here if

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
I click and drag over all of these it'll

201
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
show you how many objects you have

202
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
selected let me move this out of the way

203
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
you can see we have 19 objects selected

204
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
so I have 19 copies in total what I'm

205
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,639
going to do is I'm going to convert

206
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,960
these to a path so I'll go to path and

207
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,319
select stroke to path and then I will

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
unify them together by going to path and

209
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
selecting Union and now what I will do

210
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
is I will come back over here to my fill

211
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,080
and stroke tab I want to bring the

212
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,879
opacity down in half so I can see what

213
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,599
I'm about to do once I do this and now I

214
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,360
will go to path and select break apart

215
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,639
and you can see what I mean there once

216
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
you break that apart you can see all of

217
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,879
the different layers beneath the

218
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,560
original so I'll click off of that to

219
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,400
deselect it and I want to take this

220
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,319
larger hexagon in the back here and just

221
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,720
press delete on the keyboard to get rid

222
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,360
of that and then I'll take this object

223
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
in the center and press delete to get

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,879
press delete to get rid of that and then

225
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,520
I will bring the opacity of this up to

226
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,199
to 100% And if you want you can go and

227
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,840
color in each of these arms a different

228
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
color if you want to apply your own

229
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,240
design uh your own style to it or what

230
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,599
you could do is you could just select it

231
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,879
all and go to path and select Union and

232
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,159
we end up with this cool little abstract

233
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,319
sort of hexagon shape so I think that

234
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,599
should do it for this tutorial that's

235
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,639
just one example of how you can use the

236
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
transform tool in inkscape to create an

237
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,080
interesting design if you found this

238
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,879
lesson useful then consider checking out

239
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,080
my inkscape master class it's a

240
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
collection of over 60 videos where I go

241
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,560
over all of the tools and features in

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
inkscape and I explain what they are and

243
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,599
demonstrate how they work kind of like

244
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,840
how I did in this video we even have a

245
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
private Community where you can ask

246
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,479
questions and get help from me anytime

247
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
you want and best of all there's no

248
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,400
monthly membership fees you just pay $17

249
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
one time and you're in for Life I'll

250
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,000
have some information about that down

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
below if you want to check that out as

252
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,560
always thanks for watching
