1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,780
you can divide your artwork up into

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,299
individual Carousel slides and then

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,360
export them as individual PNG or jpeg

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,179
images using inkscape so I'll go ahead

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,740
and get started here in inkscape the

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,179
example we'll be working with for this

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,340
demonstration is the Instagram Carousel

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,260
slide which they recommend a size of

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,560
1080 by 1350 so what I'm going to do is

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
grab the rectangle tool and I'm going to

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,340
click and drag to draw a rectangle and I

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,400
want to make this to be 1080 width by

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,399
1350 height so I will grab my selection

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,680
tool I'll come up here to where the

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,480
width and height inputs are and I'll

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,219
change the width to well first of all

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,420
make sure you're working with pixels

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,760
here and then make sure this lock icon

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,559
is turned off and I will make this a

21
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,719
width of 1080.

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,640
and then I will make this a height of

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,379
1350.

24
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,840
and now we have the size this represents

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
one slide on the carousel so if you want

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,000
to have three or four slides we're going

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,440
to have to create three or four copies

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,820
of this and stack them next to each

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
other so let me first change the

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,260
documents so that it's the size of this

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,119
rectangle here so with the rectangle

32
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,680
selected I'm just going to press Ctrl

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,659
shift r on the keyboard or if you're

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,400
using Mac it would be command shift R

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
and it's going to resize the document to

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,240
the selection as you can see there and

37
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,740
now we want to get rid of that border

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,780
and the shadow around the border so let

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,180
me go to document properties I'll go to

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,439
file

41
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,320
document properties

42
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,479
and where it says border let's first

43
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
turn off the Border shadow

44
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,960
and then we will turn off the Border

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,280
altogether

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,560
and then we can close out of this menu

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,079
so we now have a single document for a

48
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,520
single tile so what we have to do is

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,799
create three or four duplicate copies of

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,360
this for the for this demonstration I

51
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,640
will create three slides if you want to

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,960
create more you can go ahead and do that

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,880
first I'm going to turn on snapping up

54
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,979
here in this top right corner and then

55
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm going to snap this rectangle to the

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,159
right hand side of the page there like

57
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,560
that and then I will grab the documents

58
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,119
tool down here

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,979
I will snap to the bottom right corner

60
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,320
then click and drag and then snap to the

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,060
top left corner to draw the second page

62
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,640
and if I move this over we now have a

63
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,619
second document there now it looks like

64
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,598
one continuous document but these are

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,580
two separate two separate documents here

66
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,640
we have page one and then page two

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
so now I'm going to create my third

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
slide I'm going to snap this over here

69
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,080
to the right hand side

70
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,120
and I will grab my documents tool again

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,819
snap to the bottom right corner

72
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,760
click and drag

73
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,220
there we go there's page three so let me

74
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,360
grab this and move this out of the way

75
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm just going to work with three slides

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,900
for this demonstration so I'm going to

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,879
delete this rectangle now if you want

78
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,260
four or five slides you'll just have to

79
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,360
repeat that process a few more times but

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
we now have the template that we can use

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,319
to design our independent slides and I'm

82
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,819
gonna for this demonstration I'm gonna

83
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,620
bring in an image that I've downloaded

84
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
from a stock photo site let me just open

85
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
this up I have this on my other screen

86
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,379
over here I'm going to click and drag

87
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,060
the image onto my canvas like that

88
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,660
okay so now I have imported my artwork

89
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,819
onto the canvas the problem that we have

90
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,980
now is that you can't see exactly where

91
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,680
the artwork lines up with the canvas so

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,260
we're going to re-enable borders so that

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,819
we can see that let me place this on top

94
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,340
of the top of the document like that and

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,599
then I will open up the document

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,300
properties menu again file document

97
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
properties

98
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,060
and now

99
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm going to turn the Border back on

100
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,319
I'm going to make it so that the border

101
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,940
is always on top I'm going to tick that

102
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,560
box and now you will see the border on

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,080
top of your artwork and I'm going to

104
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,060
leave show shadow turned off that's not

105
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,220
necessary and depending on the

106
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
composition of your image you may want

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,280
to change the color of your border if

108
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,019
you notice here my border is kind of

109
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,340
blending in with the image it doesn't

110
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,379
stand out very well so I'm going to make

111
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,299
this border white so I'm going to change

112
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,819
the Border color up here

113
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,280
then I'm going to make this white

114
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,260
and you can see you can see that border

115
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,640
much better now

116
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,140
and if you want to bring down the

117
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,900
opacity of it so it isn't so sharp you

118
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,819
could bring this down a little bit and

119
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,440
now it gives you a better idea of what

120
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,819
the continuous image will look like

121
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,680
because the Border isn't so prominent

122
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,560
there so let me close out of that now

123
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,019
and we now have our document set up with

124
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,659
three different Carousel slides that we

125
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,280
can add our contents to so I'm going to

126
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,380
resize my image to fit this better I'm

127
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,760
going to turn off snapping now we don't

128
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,959
need that anymore

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,699
and I'm going to hold Ctrl while I'm

130
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,260
scaling and I'm going to place my

131
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,060
artwork right about where I want the

132
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,520
three slides to be so in this first

133
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,160
slide I want the subject to be in here

134
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,740
and then the last two slides I can let

135
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,699
it be the rest of the image like that

136
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,380
and what you could do now is you can go

137
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,900
through here and add some contents so I

138
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,160
think for this demonstration I'll just

139
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,440
add some simple little dummy text and

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,400
then we'll take it from there

141
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
okay so I have some sample text in there

142
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
if you want to make sure that your

143
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,580
elements that your design elements are

144
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,800
aligning perfectly with each individual

145
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,139
slide of the carousel just open up your

146
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,639
aligned distribute menu by going to

147
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,680
object and selecting align and

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,940
distribute down here at the bottom of

149
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,139
the list

150
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,660
and then set the relative to set this to

151
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,300
page and now whichever page you have the

152
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,880
design element placed over you can

153
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,919
Center and align it based on that

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,419
particular page there so I'll make a

155
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,820
duplicate of that by pressing Ctrl D and

156
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,440
I'll move this over here

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,479
and then I will Center this up on this

158
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,580
page as well

159
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,199
okay so let's say that this is the

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
design I want to export these are the

161
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,220
three slides I want to work with here

162
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,419
to do this we're going to create

163
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,419
separate images of each tile here using

164
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,759
the batch export feature so let's go up

165
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,539
to where it says file and go to export

166
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,460
and then over here in the export menu

167
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,139
we're going to choose batch export

168
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,000
because we want to export all three of

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
these slides at once

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
and we're going to choose pages over

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,060
here and if you notice over here this is

172
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,020
a preview of what's going to get

173
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,180
exported we have page one page two and

174
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,280
Page Three now if yours is not in order

175
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,139
don't worry sometimes it just indexes

176
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,639
them here in the wrong order but they

177
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,199
will be exported with the proper name

178
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,900
and the and in the proper order so uh

179
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,120
this this title page one page two page

180
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,280
three down here you can choose like a

181
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
prefix for the name

182
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,039
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

183
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,660
click this little folder icon over here

184
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,340
to choose where I would like to export

185
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,900
these designs

186
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,880
so what you can do here is change the

187
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
name of the files that will be exported

188
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,139
the default here as you can see is

189
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,880
bitmap.png if I leave the default here

190
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,160
as it is the files are going to be saved

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,639
with the names bitmap Dash page1.png and

192
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,979
then page2.png and so on and so forth

193
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm just going to leave that as it is

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
down here you can choose your file type

195
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
if you'd like the default is PNG but if

196
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
you want to export as JPEG or Tiff or

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,039
webp there you go there that option is

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,500
and I'm going to click save and what

199
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll do here is I will just put up on

200
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,919
the screen here the result of exporting

201
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,740
these three documents as individual

202
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,139
Carousel slides and you can now upload

203
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,660
these to Instagram or wherever else to

204
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,000
have three separate images that make one

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,280
continuous image so that's how you can

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,199
divide your artwork up into individual

207
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,199
Carousel slides using inkscape if you

208
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,880
found this lesson useful then consider

209
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,800
checking out my inkscape master class

210
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,960
it's a collection of over 60 videos

211
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,580
where I go over all of the tools and

212
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,620
features in inkscape and I explain what

213
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,180
they are and demonstrate how they work

214
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,759
kind of like how I did in this video we

215
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440

216
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,180
