1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,280
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,740
you can create half tone gradients using

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,960
inkscape so to get started the first

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,580
thing I'm going to do is create a new

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,940
document size to 1280x720 your document

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,620
doesn't have to be that size just make

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,059
your document in whatever size you'd

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,500
like your gradient to be

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
so I'll turn on snapping up here and

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,460
I'll grab my rectangle tool and I'm

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,779
going to snap to the corners of my

12
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,220
document and click and drag to create a

13
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,039
rectangle in the size of my document

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,779
now I'm going to make this rectangle

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,119
white and I'm going to apply a black and

16
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,679
white gradient so let me open up the

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,059
fill and stroke menu by coming up here

18
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,280
to where it says object and selecting

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
fill and stroke

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,420
now Under The Fill tab I'm going to

21
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,920
select this button right here that says

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,840
linear gradient

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,520
and when we get these handles here on

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,899
the screen I'm going to select this

25
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,520
handle over here on the right and I'm

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
going to make this one black

27
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,360
and then I'm going to take this gradient

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,920
handle and snap it to the bottom right

29
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,960
corner and I'll take this gradient

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,760
handle and snap it to the top right

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,899
corner

32
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,120
and now we have a white to black radiant

33
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,500
like that

34
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,140
so now let's open up the layers menu let

35
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,880
me grab my select tool let's come up

36
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,380
here to where it says layer and select

37
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,340
layers and objects

38
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,360
and what we're going to do now is we're

39
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,920
going to turn off actually no we're

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
going to lock the layer here and then

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,360
click the plus icon over here to create

42
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,080
a new layer

43
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm going to click add I'm going to

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,479
leave the default as it is make sure

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,820
it's above current and click add and now

46
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm going to zoom in on the top left

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
corner of my document over here and I'm

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,820
going to grab my ellipse tool I'm going

49
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,320
to snap to the top left corner and I'm

50
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
going to click and drag to create a

51
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
circle and I'm going to hold to the

52
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,579
control key to make sure we're creating

53
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,680
a perfectly round circle and I'll make

54
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
it about that size right there don't

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,040
worry too much about the size at this

56
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
point we can go back and change that

57
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,740
later

58
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,960
now this step is important if you're

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,100
using one of the newer versions of

60
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,899
inkscape because I noticed by default it

61
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,060
sets the stroke to unknown so come over

62
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,340
here to the fill and stroke Tab and

63
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,200
under the stroke paint tab if you have

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,299
this question mark box highlighted just

65
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,740
click this x right here to make sure

66
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,659
there's no stroke because if that is

67
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,920
enabled then it's going to mess up what

68
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,540
we're about to do

69
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,758
so now once you've done that

70
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,038
grab your selection tool with the object

71
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,959
selected go to edit

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,080
clone create titled clones

73
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,940
and the settings we're going to use here

74
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,459
we're going to use Trace

75
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,140
select the option right here that says

76
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,120
trace the drawing under the Clones we

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
want to trace by color

78
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,599
we're going to leave these set to zero

79
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,700
and the only two options we want enabled

80
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,980
over here are size and color and then

81
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,840
come down here and choose width and

82
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,180
height over rows and columns now where

83
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,099
it says width and height input the width

84
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,140
and height of your document my document

85
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,599
was 1280x720 so I have that there

86
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,459
already and then I just have this

87
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,959
enabled here to save these settings next

88
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
time I use this so I'll click create now

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
and once you do that you can see it

90
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
generates those it generates that black

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,180
circle over the linear gradient and

92
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,680
turns it into this halftone gradient so

93
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
let's work with this some more let's

94
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,519
first go back to our layers menu let me

95
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,800
collapse this and I'll turn off the

96
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
visibility of layer 1. so now we just

97
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
have the halftone gradient and if you

98
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,640
want to change the size of these dots

99
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,440
you could zoom in on this let me grab

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
the original dot over here

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,459
and let me turn off snapping now because

102
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,319
that'll just get in the way and I'll

103
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,360
make this a little smaller

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,980
and you can see what happens as I make

105
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,959
that smaller it makes the gradient

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,940
smaller as well and I can make this

107
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,860
bigger and get the opposite effect

108
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,840
now we have that effect right there and

109
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,940
anything I do to this object will also

110
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,800
be applied to the rest of these dots so

111
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,239
you can change the color now if you'd

112
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,220
like as well

113
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,780
and there you go that is how you can

114
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,239
create a simple halftone gradient using

115
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
inkscape if you found this lesson useful

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,500
then consider checking out my inkscape

117
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,659
master class it's a collection of over

118
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,640
60 videos where I go over all of the

119
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,440
tools and features in inkscape and I

120
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,060
explain what they are and demonstrate

121
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,980
how they work kind of like how I did in

122
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,019
this video we even have a private

123
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,519
Community where you can ask questions

124
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,620
and get help from me anytime you want

125
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,780
and best of all there's no monthly

membership fees you just pay 17 one time

127
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
and you're in for Life I'll have some

128
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
