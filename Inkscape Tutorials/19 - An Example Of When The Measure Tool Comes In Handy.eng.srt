1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,100
in this tutorial we'll be going over an

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,019
example of when the measurement tool

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,299
would come in handy in inkscape and the

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,799
example we'll be working with in this

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,639
lesson is the Gmail logo now this is a

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,980
rasterized PNG image that I have copied

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,960
and pasted into inkscape if I zoom in

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,119
here you can see the pixelation let's

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,400
say we wanted to trace a vector copy of

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,439
this logo to work with the way that you

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,820
would normally do that is by creating

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,100
individual shapes in this example it

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,740
would be rectangles that make up the

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,900
design here now the problem with the

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Gmail logo is that these lines here go

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,520
at an unusual angle normally when you're

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
working with inkscape you can rotate

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
objects in 15 degree increments or you

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,120
can rotate them freehand now the problem

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,620
with rotating them freehand is that

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,480
you'll have to guess what size the

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,579
rectangle has to be before rotating it

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,920
otherwise it won't be accurate so this

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,539
is where the measurement tool comes in

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,500
handy

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,940
so I'm going to click on the logo to

27
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,960
select it and I'm going to bring down

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,760
the opacity in half just so I can see

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,140
the measurements that I'm taking on top

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,480
of it and then I'm going to zoom in here

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
and I want to take a measurement of this

32
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,960
line right here to find out what this

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,580
angle is and to do that I'm going to use

34
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,780
the measurement tool which is located

35
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,880
over here in the toolbar or you can

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,500
access it by pressing the letter M on

37
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,640
the keyboard

38
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
and with that tool enabled I'm going to

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
bring my cursor over to the edge of the

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,460
line here and I'm going to click and

41
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,140
drag a line

42
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,900
that goes along the edge of the logo

43
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
there and as you can see the measurement

44
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,540
that I'm working with is 37.14 now this

45
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,040
isn't totally accurate so I'm just going

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
to change this a little bit just to make

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
sure it's flush against the edge there

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,259
okay now we have a more accurate

49
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,380
measurement this angle right here is

50
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,700
36.95 so I'm going to remember that

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,140
number and now I'm going to create

52
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,420
guides and change the angles of those

53
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,579
guides to match that right there so let

54
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,220
me go back to my selection tool

55
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,740
now I'm going to enable the ruler on my

56
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,380
canvas so that I can create my guides if

57
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,060
you're using Windows or Linux you can

58
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,700
get your ruler by pressing Ctrl r or if

59
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,259
you're using Mac you could press command

60
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,299
R and there we have the ruler on the

61
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,799
screen

62
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,600
so with the ruler enabled I'm going to

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,159
bring my cursor to the top edge of the

64
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,020
ruler and click and drag down to create

65
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,399
a guide like that

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,139
and now I'm going to change the angle of

67
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,760
this guide by hovering my cursor over

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
until it highlights red and then double

69
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,480
clicking it and then we'll get this menu

70
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,220
here where we can change the angle if

71
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,080
you see right here we have angle and

72
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,940
this the angle is set to zero so I'm

73
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,020
going to change this to my measurement

74
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,300
which is 36.95 and I will press ok

75
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,459
and now I can take this guide and I can

76
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,560
place it up against the edge of the

77
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,360
design there and now I can make a

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
duplicate of this guide I can double

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
click it again and I can go to duplicate

80
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,420
and I can take this duplicate copy and I

81
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400
can place this on the bottom Edge right

82
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,580
here

83
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,540
let me just move in a little closer here

84
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,860
and make sure that that is a little more

85
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,280
accurate

86
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,319
okay that's better

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,879
now you may be wondering if we have to

88
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,319
create more guides for this side

89
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,120
normally we would but with this design

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
this design is symmetrical so we won't

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,019
have to do that we can just create the

92
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,239
left hand side and then make a duplicate

93
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,620
copy and mirror it over here to the

94
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,239
right hand side so we're good with these

95
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
guides as it is let's trace the rest of

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
this logo I'm going to grab my bezier

97
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
pen by pressing B on the keyboard and I

98
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
want to make sure I have the proper

99
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
setting enabled

100
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,099
and I'm going to start the line halfway

101
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,420
through the design right here first let

102
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,640
me turn on snapping so I can snap to the

103
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,959
guide

104
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to snap right there

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,739
and then hold Ctrl and bring the line

106
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,420
straight up to the other guide and click

107
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,680
again

108
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,879
and then I'm going to bring this line

109
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,739
all the way out here I want this to I

110
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,060
want this to really stick out far

111
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,140
because we're going to trim off the

112
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,400
edges I'm going to bring this out here

113
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,140
and then I'll snap to this line again

114
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,879
and then I'll come back to the starting

115
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,739
point over here like that

116
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,440
and now we've completed the shape

117
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,180
so now let's complete the rest of the

118
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,159
design I'm going to turn off snapping

119
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,580
let me fill in this shape here I'm going

120
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,780
to give this a color I'm going to remove

121
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,519
The Stroke by holding shift and clicking

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,560
this red X down here and I'll bring down

123
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
the opacity of this as well so I can see

124
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
what's going on beneath it

125
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,659
and now I'm going to create another

126
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,879
shape for this leg of the logo right

127
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,840
here I'm going to come over here to my

128
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
rectangle tool and I'm going to click

129
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,680
and drag to create a rectangle that goes

130
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,959
over the top like that I want this to

131
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,519
stick out as well and then I'm going to

132
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,780
zoom in on this let me make this a

133
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,220
different color so I could differentiate

134
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,000
it

135
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,798
and I'm going to grab my select tool and

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm going to come down here and zoom in

137
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,339
a lot just so I can make sure that I get

138
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,320
an accurate placement on the edge of the

139
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
logo there and I did that for the bottom

140
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,680
Edge I'll come over here and do this for

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,300
the right Edge as well

142
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,860
I'm going to change this width right

143
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,180
here

144
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,280
and then I'll do the same over here for

145
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,419
the left Edge I'm going to make sure

146
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,520
everything is accurate or as close as it

147
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
can be sometimes it's a little different

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
a little difficult when you have

149
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
pixelation

150
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
and now I'm going to trim off these

151
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,460
unwanted edges there's various ways that

152
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,780
we can do this but for this particular

153
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
logo I'm just going to select both of

154
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,360
these objects and go to path and select

155
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
fracture

156
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,740
and now I can take this object and get

157
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,600
rid of it and then I can take this

158
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,580
object right here and get rid of that as

159
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,620
well and now we can turn off the

160
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,360
visibility of the guides because they're

161
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,220
just getting in the way now by pressing

162
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,600
the vertical Bar Key so I'm going to

163
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,979
hold shift and press the vertical Bar

164
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,020
Key to turn off the visibility and now

165
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060
let's round these edges

166
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,620
so let me zoom in on this if you notice

167
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,020
now we have three different shapes that

168
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,880
make up the left hand side of that logo

169
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,759
so let me zoom in over here let me go to

170
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,039
my edit pads my nodes tool

171
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,800
and I'm going to enable the corners life

172
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
path effect and we're going to get these

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,740
round knots here and I'm going to take

174
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,120
this round knot and I'm going to click

175
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,000
and drag this down until this corner

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,860
matches the Contour of the logo there

177
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,539
just like that and that looks pretty

178
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,340
good so I'll finalize that by going to

179
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,520
path and selecting object to path and

180
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,660
then I'll come down here and do the same

181
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,820
thing I'm going to click on this object

182
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
and I'm going to enable the live path

183
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
effect again the corners life path

184
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,280
effect and then I'll take this knot and

185
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,500
then I will bring this down until this

186
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,419
matches the Contour of this left hand

187
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,620
side right there

188
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,560
and then I'll finalize that by going to

189
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,259
path object to path and now we can zoom

190
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,539
out and at this point the left hand side

191
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,460
of the design is finished we now just

192
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
have to duplicate it and mirror it to

193
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,699
the other side so let me grab my

194
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,400
selection tool let me take this take all

195
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,440
of these objects and move them over here

196
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,419
let me bring the opacity of them all the

197
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,139
way up

198
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,880
and then I'll bring the opacity of the

199
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,259
original logo all the way up as well

200
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,460
because we're going to color this in in

201
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,479
a minute

202
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,340
and I'll move this over as a matter of

203
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,860
fact so I don't run out of canvas space

204
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,360
and now I'm going to duplicate this I'm

205
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,259
going to right click it and go to

206
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,520
duplicate

207
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm going to bring this over here I want

208
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,639
to flip this horizontally with this

209
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,900
button right here or you can just press

210
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,699
the letter H on the keyboard

211
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,160
and I'm going to enable snapping again

212
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,479
and I'm just going to snap these two

213
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,039
together

214
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,139
and now I want to unify these two pieces

215
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,000
together because this is actually one

216
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,380
piece as you can see in here so I'm

217
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,419
going to select this object hold shift

218
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,600
select this object and go to path

219
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,919
Union

220
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,020
and now all we have to do is Select each

221
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,180
object and grab our dropper tool and

222
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,740
change its color so I'm going to select

223
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm going to start with this object

224
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,860
right here I'm going to grab the dropper

225
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,080
tool which is located over here or I'm

226
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
just going to use a keyboard shortcut

227
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
which is the letter d and then I will

228
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,240
just sample that area right there to

229
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
make that the same color and then I'll

230
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
go back to my select tool by pressing

231
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,060
the letter s select this object and then

232
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,560
back to the dropper by pressing the

233
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
letter d and I'll do the same thing I'll

234
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,039
just toggle back and forth between those

235
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,039
two tools and fill in the rest of my

236
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,419
colors like this

237
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,880
and just like that we have created a

238
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,580
vector copy of the Gmail logo so that's

239
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,620
just one example of when the measurement

240
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,199
tool can come in handy in inkscape

241
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,180
if you found this lesson useful then

242
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,039
consider checking out my inkscape master

243
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,259
class it's a collection of over 60

244
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,180
videos where I go over all of the tools

245
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,979
and features in inkscape and I explain

246
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,720
what they are and demonstrate how they

247
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,460
work kind of like how I did in this

248
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,560
video we even have a private Community

249
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479

250
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,060

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,099
just pay 17 one time and you're in for

253
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,780
Life I'll have some information about

254
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,919
