1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,839
although inkscape is meant for working

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,040
with vector graphics

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,880
it does have some features and tools

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,560
that allow you to make common edits to

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,160
photographs and other types of

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,840
rasterized images

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
and even though you'd be better off

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
using proper photo editing software for

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,400
this sort of thing

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,839
you may find yourself working in a

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,520
vector environment once in a while

12
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
and needing to just make a quick edit to

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,800
an image

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,119
in these instances launching yet another

15
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,439
application can be an inconvenience

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,279
this is where inkscape's photo editing

17
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
ability comes in handy

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,400
and in this video i'll be going over 8

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
different ways in which you can edit

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,479
photos

21
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,390
in inkscape

22
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,300
[Music]

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
this is nick with logosbynick.com and in

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,320
this video i'll be going over some of

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
the ways in which you can edit photos in

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
inkscape

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
but before we get started if you'd like

28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,239
to learn everything that there is to

29
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,079
know about inkscape be sure to check out

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,760
my inkscape master class

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
it's a collection of over 60 videos

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
where i go over every tool and feature

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,000
in inkscape

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
and i explain what it is and demonstrate

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
how it works i'll have a link in the

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,479
description of the video if you want to

37
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
check that out

38
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,479
the first way in which you can edit a

39
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,960
photo in inkscape is by cropping it

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
to crop your photo all you have to do is

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
create a rectangle going over the

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
portion of the photo you'd like to crop

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
and then create a clipping mask from it

44
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
from there you can just resize your

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
document based on the cropped image by

46
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,280
pressing ctrl

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,759
shift and r and then from there you can

48
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,920
export your work as a png file

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,280
i'll have a tutorial linked in the

50
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
description of the video if you need

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
more details

52
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,840
not only can clipping pads be used to

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
crop photos in inkscape

54
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
but they can also be used to extract

55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,040
subjects from the photo

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
this allows you to do all kinds of

57
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
unique things like create a photo

58
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,439
pop-out effect or

59
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,840
remove a background from an image these

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
extractions can be made by simply

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,119
grabbing the bezier pen

62
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,600
and manually drawing a path around the

63
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
subject you'd like to extract

64
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,439
then from there you can create a

65
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
clipping path from it by selecting both

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,920
objects

67
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
and navigating to object clip set

68
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,040
another way that you can edit photos in

69
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
inkscape is by adjusting their opacity

70
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,639
and inkscape allows you to change

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
opacity values in a variety of different

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,599
ways

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,840
you can change the overall opacity of an

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
image by selecting it and opening the

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,959
fill and stroke menu

76
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
from there grab the opacity slider and

77
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
adjust it to your liking

78
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
you can also give a photo partial

79
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
transparency or a transparency gradient

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
by using layer masks this makes it so

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
that one side of an image is visible

82
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,400
but gradually tapers off to transparency

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
this can be really useful when designing

84
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
things like headers and posters where

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
you need to incorporate imagery with

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
text in other vector elements

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
layer masking is somewhat of an advanced

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
topic but the gist of it is that you

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
create an object with the black and

90
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,239
white gradient

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
and then apply it over your image as a

92
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
mask the black areas create a

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
transparent area in the photo whereas

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
the white areas remain opaque

95
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,680
i'll have a tutorial for this linked in

96
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
the description of the video if you want

97
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
a more in-depth explanation

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
inkscape also allows you to make some

99
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,120
common color adjustments to your photos

100
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
for example you can invert the colors of

101
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
an image by selecting it and navigating

102
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,000
to filters

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
colors invert you can also make your

104
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
image black and white

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
or grayscale by navigating to filters

106
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,200
color

107
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
grayscale and from there you can adjust

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
the rgb values to your liking

109
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
in fact the filters menu has lots of

110
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
interesting and unique effects that can

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,040
be applied to your images

112
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
so be sure to browse through there and

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
experiment for yourself

114
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
speaking of color adjustments inkscape

115
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,760
also allows you to make some more

116
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,680
advanced color corrections like color

117
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
channels and

118
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,519
levels and hsb values all you have to do

119
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,519
to access these settings is navigate to

120
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,400
extensions

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
and raster and from there you will have

122
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
a wide array of raster effects that you

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
can use to edit your photos in inkscape

124
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,519
in a past tutorial i used these effects

125
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,599
to create a carved wood effect

126
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
from an image of a piece of wood

127
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
another common edit you may like to

128
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,799
apply to your photos once in a while is

129
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
to apply a blur or maybe sharpen your

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,599
image

131
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,840
to apply a blur open the fill and stroke

132
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
menu by pressing ctrl

133
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
shift and the letter a on your keyboard

134
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
and from there you can use the blur

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
slider to apply a gaussian blur to your

136
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,000
liking

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
to sharpen your image simply navigate to

138
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
filters

139
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,199
image effects and select sharpen

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,160
unfortunately

141
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,919
there's no way to adjust the threshold

142
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
of the filter but this can still be a

143
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,720
handy trick

144
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,680
for a quick touch-up

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
as we went over earlier you can use the

146
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
bezier pen to manually draw

147
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,160
shapes over subjects to extract them

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
from their background

149
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
if the background you'd like to remove

150
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
is white though then you won't need to

151
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
go through all of that trouble

152
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
you can simply use the trace bitmap

153
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,800
feature to generate a vector silhouette

154
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
of your subject then apply it as a

155
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
clipping path

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
it should be noted that this method is

157
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
far from perfect there are instances

158
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
where the auto trace feature won't be

159
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,759
able to make an accurate distinction

160
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,880
between the foreground and the

161
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,520
background

162
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
but when it does work it can save you an

163
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,479
incredible amount of time

164
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
the final method that you can deploy for

165
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
editing photos in inkscape

166
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
is using blend modes this is somewhat of

167
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
a hidden feature in inkscape that not a

168
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,080
lot of users know about

169
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,479
to access it open your layers menu by

170
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,600
pressing ctrl

171
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
shift and l on your keyboard from there

172
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,080
you can add a new layer on top of your

173
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,960
image layer

174
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,039
and any of the contents placed on that

175
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
layer can be blended into the image

176
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
beneath it

177
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
using the blend mode drop down near the

178
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
bottom of the menu

179
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
as you could imagine we've only begun to

180
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
scratch the surface of all the different

181
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
ways that you can edit photos in

182
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
inkscape

183
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,479
although these features may not be as

184
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,720
robust or intuitive as a raster image

185
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,919
editor like

186
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,520
they can still come in handy if you just

187
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
need a quick and basic edit

188
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
and you don't feel like launching

189
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
another application let me know in the

190
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,919
comments if there's any ways that you

191
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,680
