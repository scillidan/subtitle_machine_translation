1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,719
in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,919
how you can use inkscape to draw objects

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,319
that have a complicated Contour to them

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,720
and a good example of this would be

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,599
these eyeglass frames which I've created

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
here for this demonstration so I'll be

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
showing you how to create this before we

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,719
get started though if you want to learn

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,680
more about how inkscape Works be sure to

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,000
check out my inkscape master class it's

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,840
a collection of over 80 videos where I

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,720
go over every tool and feature in this

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
software and I explain what it is and

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,679
demonstrate how it works we even have a

15
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,119
private Community where you can ask

16
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,759
questions and get help from me anytime

17
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,480
you want so I'll have some information

18
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,680
about that down below if you want to

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,200
check that out and with that out of the

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,440
way let's get started so let me move

21
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,120
this out of the way and I'm going to get

22
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,640
started by drawing a rectangle so I'm

23
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,200
going to grab my squares and rectangles

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
tool and I'm going to draw a rectangle

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,320
and I'll grab my selection tool and I

26
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,600
want to size this rectangle at 400x 200

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,160
pixels so for the width I'll put in 400

28
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,239
and then for the height I'll put in 200

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,079
now we want to convert this to a path by

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,160
going to path and selecting object to

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
path and I'm going to zoom in on this a

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,719
little bit now I'm going to grab my

33
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,440
nodes tool and I'm going to click and

34
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
drag over these two nodes right here to

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,119
select both of them and I want to enable

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,960
this option up here in the toolbar that

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,759
says show transformation handles for

38
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,560
selected nodes I'm going to turn that on

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,439
and that's going to give us

40
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,840
transformation handles for these

41
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,520
selected nodes and I'm going to hold

42
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,880
control and shift and I'm just going to

43
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,280
scale these two nodes in about this far

44
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,560
now if you look at the bottom left of

45
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
the screen it'll show you how much

46
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,439
you're scaling it by for this

47
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,880
demonstration I'm going to scale it by

48
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,040
about 70% it doesn't have to be exact

49
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,320
but somewhere thereabouts is good enough

50
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,880
and once you do that you can go ahead

51
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,399
and disable this setting that we just

52
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,320
enabled and now that that's done I'm

53
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
just going to click and drag this top

54
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,240
Edge right here to give this a nice

55
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,079
curved contour and I'll do the same

56
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,240
thing down here I'm going to click and

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
drag this down as well to give that a

58
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
rounded contour and maybe I'll bring

59
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,320
that up a little more and I'll do the

60
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,439
same thing over here on the side edges

61
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,159
of the glass frame or the eyeglass

62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
frame so now we're going to take these

63
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
corners and make them rounded so I'm

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,560
going to come up here to the toolbar and

65
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm going to select this option right

66
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,439
here that says add corner LP and once

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
you do that click and drag over all four

68
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
nodes right there and we're going to

69
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
take this rounded node and bring that in

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
and as you can see as I do that it's

71
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,040
rounding the corner of those nodes now

72
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
right about there looks good once I do

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,480
that I'm going to click on just this

74
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
node right here and I'm going to make

75
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,519
this one a little extra

76
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,760
rounded and that right there is about

77
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,480
the effect we're going for so I'm going

78
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,120
to finalize this now by coming back up

79
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
here to the toolbar and selecting this

80
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
option that says object to path when you

81
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,319
hover your cursor over it click on that

82
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,239
and now we've converted that to a path

83
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,920
so let me grab my selection tool zoom

84
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,120
out a bit and now I'm going to turn this

85
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
from a solid object into a uh like an

86
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
eyeglass frame so to do that I'm going

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,959
to first make this a lighter shade of

88
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,280
gray and then I'm going to go to path

89
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
and I will select linked path or linked

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
offset and that's going to create

91
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
another copy of it behind it so I want I

92
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,319
want to make that other copy black so

93
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,200
let me click on black and I'm going to

94
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
take this node and bring this out about

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,920
that far we want this Noe to be about

96
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,000
that far and that right right about

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
there looks good and I will click this

98
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,879
button again that says object to path

99
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,000
now I'll grab my selection tool hold

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,120
shift and click on the gray object in

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
the middle so that we have them both

102
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,000
selected and we're going to subtract

103
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,959
them from each other by going to path

104
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,720
and selecting difference and once you do

105
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,879
that let's come over here to the fill

106
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,519
and stroke menu if you don't have your

107
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
fill and stroke menu open just come down

108
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
here to the fill and just double click

109
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
that and it should open over here on the

110
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,519
right hand side and I want to take this

111
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,400
and bring the opacity down roughly in

112
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,959
half and once that's done let's right

113
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,480
click on this and go to duplicate and

114
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
I'm going to hold control and bring this

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,959
object over here to the left like

116
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
that and I'm going to zoom in on this

117
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
right here and the reason why I made

118
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
them halfway transparent is because I

119
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,319
want to see where they line up I want to

120
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,319
take this object and I'm holding control

121
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,680
the whole time I do this to lock it onto

122
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
the horizontal axis and I want to

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,799
overlap overlap this object about that

124
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,319
far and you can see the area where they

125
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,760
overlap right about there and I'm going

126
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,400
to duplicate this object again I'm going

127
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
to right click it and go to duplicate

128
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,680
and I'm going to take this copy and put

129
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,280
it up here and I want to zoom in and I

130
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
want to make this object if I'm looking

131
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,599
right about here I want it to intersect

132
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,640
with the other object right about there

133
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,959
and where I'm going with this is I'm

134
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,918
going to create an object from this

135
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,639
empty space in here and I'm going to use

136
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,160
that as sort of like the uh the edge of

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,840
the eyeglass frame there so once that's

138
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
done I'm going to position that right

139
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,960
about there you may want to try to

140
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,800
visualize what this Contour looks like

141
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,680
like going up top here so if you may

142
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
have to move it just to make it look

143
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
more fluid I think right about there

144
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,680
looks pretty good if it doesn't look

145
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
perfect don't worry about it we're going

146
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,400
to address that in just a moment so let

147
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,639
me move this in just a little

148
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,759
more and once that's done I'm going to

149
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,280
select all of these so let me click and

150
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
drag over all of them to select them and

151
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
now I'm going to go into my shape

152
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,919
Builder tool which is over here I'm

153
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,639
going to click on that and I want to

154
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,280
make sure I have the addition option

155
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,520
enabled and then I'm going to click on

156
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,639
this object right here and then this

157
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,880
object right here and it's going to make

158
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,960
them into separate objects and now I can

159
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,680
go back to my selection tool and now I

160
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
have that as a separate object and what

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,400
I want to do now is take just this

162
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,039
object I'm going to make this red just

163
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,000
so I can differentiate it and hold

164
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,320
control and shift and scale this up

165
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
about that far we want this to be a

166
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
little bit bigger and then I'm going to

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,840
bring this in and place it right about

168
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,360
there now mine looks a little sloppy

169
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,919
there's some Jagged edges in there don't

170
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,160
worry about that we're going to smooth

171
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
that out in just a minute the idea is we

172
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
want to have this object that we can

173
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,840
work with and we can use as that shape

174
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,240
for the edge of the eyeglass frame so

175
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
let me move that out a little

176
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,759
more and once that's done I'm going to

177
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,120
hold shift and click on the other

178
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,960
objects so we have them both selected

179
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
and I will go into the shape Builder

180
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,400
tool again and I just want to click

181
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
click and drag a line going through

182
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,840
those just to unify them all together

183
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
and then go back to the selection tool

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
and now we have something like that

185
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,280
right there so now that that's set let's

186
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
go to our nodes tool and let's go in

187
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,759
here and clean this up so if you notice

188
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,080
over here we have a bunch of nodes

189
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,440
that's what's giving it that uneven look

190
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm I'm going to take these three nodes

191
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,319
over here to the left and I'm going to

192
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,840
press delete on the keyboard to get rid

193
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
of them and you should be able to take

194
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,400
this handle right here and just jiggle

195
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,919
it bit and you'll see it straightens out

196
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,240
so we have a nice straight fluid line

197
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,599
and then I'll take this handle over here

198
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:13,840
and just straighten that out a little

199
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,800
bit we want a nice fluid curve going

200
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,759
through there and then I'm going to do

201
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
the same thing over here if you notice

202
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,639
there's an extra node in here if there's

203
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,759
any extra nodes get rid of them you only

204
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,000
want one node there and then I'm going

205
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
to take this handle and bring that out I

206
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
want to make this handle so that it's

207
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,360
going parallel with the other handle or

208
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
the other side of the handle and once it

209
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,400
looks about parallel you can hold the

210
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,960
control key and then click the node and

211
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
then it'll make it automatically smooth

212
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,280
and I'm going to take this and bring

213
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,919
that in a little bit so it gives it more

214
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
of a swoop and now I'm going to cut off

215
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,240
this little corner right here so let me

216
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
grab my pen tool which is located over

217
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,919
here I'm going to click to add a point

218
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,680
hold the control button bring the line

219
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,080
straight down click to add another point

220
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,639
and then add some more points going

221
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,840
around the outside and then connect it

222
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
back to the starting point and I'm just

223
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,479
going to bring this in a little

224
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,000
more right about there looks good and

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,479
then I'll hold shift and click on the

226
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,560
object so that we have them both

227
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
selected and once again we'll go to path

228
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
and select difference and now we have

229
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
that little Notch there on the left hand

230
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,759
side I'm going to shape this up a little

231
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,720
more let me go back to my nodes tool I'm

232
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,240
going to grab this left Edge right here

233
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,960
and pull that out a little bit and I'm

234
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
going to round these Corners just a tiny

235
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
bit so I'm going to come back up here to

236
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
the add Corners live path effect and I'm

237
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,960
going to select just those two corners

238
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,759
and I'll grab this round knot right here

239
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
and just round those Corners a little

240
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,400
bit about that much looks good and then

241
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,199
I will click this button over here that

242
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,160
says object to path and there we go I'm

243
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,039
going to select Ju Just this object

244
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,720
right here and I want to click on it

245
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,840
again to get the rotation handles and I

246
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,720
want to rotate this clockwise just a

247
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
couple of degrees just to give it a

248
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
little bit of a

249
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,360
tilt about that much looks good okay so

250
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,400
now I'll uh duplicate it I'll right

251
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,120
click and go to duplicate

252
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,960
hold control bring this over to the

253
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,039
right and then I want to flip this

254
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,400
horizontally to do that I'm just going

255
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,159
to press the letter H on my keyboard and

256
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,360
it's going to flip it horizontally and

257
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
then I'll just move this over a little

258
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
more just to space it out you want to

259
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,680
eyeball about how far apart these uh

260
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,479
lenses should

261
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,039
be I think right about there looks good

262
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
and then I'm going to draw a rectangle

263
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,560
going

264
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,919
through the uh space between these two

265
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,199
objects so let me grab my rectangle tool

266
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,400
and I'm going to click and drag to draw

267
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,639
a rectangle going through there and I'm

268
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,240
going to grab my selection tool I want

269
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,159
to make sure that the bottom of the

270
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,799
rectangle ends where this curve before

271
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,599
this curve begins over here so if it's

272
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,320
up here it's about too high because this

273
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,958
curve is already beginning I want to

274
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,240
bring it down here about that far where

275
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,640
we still have a little bit of a straight

276
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
edge there and up here I want to bring

277
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
this up a little bit maybe about that

278
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
far the placement up here isn't as

279
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
important as long as it's somewhere

280
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
thereabouts it should be pretty good and

281
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,240
now I will select everything here and go

282
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,360
into my shape Builder tool and I'm just

283
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,839
going to draw a line going through all

284
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,800
of these objects here to make them one

285
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,320
single object go back to the selection

286
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,399
tool and now we're going to shape this

287
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,120
up so that it looks like this over here

288
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
what it's supposed to look like so to do

289
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,200
that let me grab my nodes

290
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,680
tool I want to select these two nodes

291
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,720
right here and I want to add a new node

292
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,959
in the middle so to do that I'm going to

293
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,399
come over here to this button at the top

294
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,800
left corner that says insert new nodes

295
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,279
and click on that and I'll take just

296
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,560
that node I'm going to click on just

297
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,200
that node and hold control and bring

298
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
that down and I want to make this into a

299
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,079
symmetrical node so I'll come back up

300
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,560
here to the toolbar and I want to select

301
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
this option that says make selected node

302
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,079
symmetric and that's going to give us

303
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,839
this symmetrical node with these handles

304
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,200
that move in and out uh the same way

305
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
then I want to select this node over

306
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,839
here hold shift select this node over

307
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,640
here so that we have them both selected

308
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,560
and I'll press delete on the keyboard to

309
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,720
get rid of those nodes and if you notice

310
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,399
we're starting to get a little bit of a

311
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,240
we have a nice fluid dip in here so let

312
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,160
me move this up a little more and I'm

313
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,440
going to move this handle out I'm going

314
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
to hold control while I do this to keep

315
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
it on its axis and I'll move this one

316
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
out about the same

317
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,519
distance and then I want to take this

318
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,360
one and just bring that in a little bit

319
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
and if I go back to my selection tool

320
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
and click off of it you can see uh how

321
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,519
it looks it looks pretty fluid but it

322
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,720
could look a little better so I'm going

323
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
to take this and bring that up a little

324
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,560
more that should help it look a little

325
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,720
more even okay that looks better and now

326
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,320
I'm just going to use I'm going to use

327
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
the nodes tool again to take this bottom

328
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,320
Edge and just bring this up like that

329
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,639
and to straighten this out I'm going to

330
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,399
click on this node take this handle and

331
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,040
bring this straight up or not straight

332
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,839
up but going up at the angle it want you

333
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,000
want it to match the angle of the edge

334
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,079
of this Frame right here so I'll bring

335
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
that up about that far and then I want

336
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
to take this node or this handle and do

337
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
the same thing we want to bring it up

338
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
about just as high and again we want to

339
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,760
use the same angle as the frame right

340
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,040
there and if I zoom out you can see we

341
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
are finished I can take the opacity and

342
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,480
bring it up to 100% And as you can see

343
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,720
we have created those eyeglass frames

344
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,880
with those really complicated Contours

345
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,320
using inkscape if you found this lesson

346
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,959
useful then consider checking out my

347
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,399
inkscape master class it's a collection

348
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,519
of over 60 videos where I go over all of

349
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,560
the tools and features in inkscape and I

350
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,160
explain what they are and demonstrate

351
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
how they work kind of like how I did in

352
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,079
this video we even have a private

353
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,680
Community where you can ask questions

354
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,320
and get help for me anytime you want and

355
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,880
best of all there's no monthly

356
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,639
membership fees you just pay $17 one

357
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,760
time and you're in for Life I'll have

358
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
some information about that down below

359
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,079
