1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
one of my favorite things about working

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,199
with vectors is having the ability to

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,200
make complex designs out of simple

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,359
shapes a good example of such would be

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,120
this iconic leaf design that was made

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
using only two circles a square and a

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
little bit of design magic in today's

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,639
lesson i'll be showing you how

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
so getting us started here the first

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,359
thing we're going to do is draw our

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,640
circle so i'm going to locate the

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
circles and ellipses tool which is

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,279
located over here

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,719
and then i'm going to click and drag on

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,239
the canvas while holding down the

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
control key so we get a nice perfectly

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
round circle like that

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,000
now what i'm going to do is open up the

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
fill and stroke menu which is located

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,079
over here or you can press ctrl shift

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
and f to open that up and it should open

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
up on the right hand side of your screen

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
over here now you can use these sliders

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
to make this whatever color you'd like

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,399
i'm going to make my leaf green so i'm

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
going to use a green shade over here

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
[Music]

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
there we go

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,120
and what i'm going to do now is reduce

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,719
the opacity of this circle i want to

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,239
drop this down roughly in half because

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
it's important that we're going to see

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
through the shapes that we're about to

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,080
work with

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
once you've done that you can go back to

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,200
the select tool over here and what i

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,880
want to do is right click on this object

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
and go to duplicate now we have two

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
copies of it

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
so now i'm going to hold down my control

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
key and click and drag this shape down

42
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
here so that we have this intersecting

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
area between these two circles right

44
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
here which is going to represent our

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
leaf shape so now i'm going to create a

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
new object out of these intersecting

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
areas by clicking and dragging over both

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
of them we want to make sure we have

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
both of them selected and then go to

50
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,280
path and select intersection

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
and this is going to represent part of

52
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
our leaf anyway

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
so now we're going to create this stem

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,119
i'm going to put this off to the side

55
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,040
for now i'm going to use a couple of

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
squares to make this stem i'm going to

57
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,320
grab the squares and rectangles tool

58
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,840
which is over here

59
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
click and drag on the canvas to create

60
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
your shape hold down control to lock the

61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
aspect ratio so we get a nice

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
symmetrical square like that

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
and now what we want to do is first make

64
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,479
sure that the corners of the square are

65
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,600
sharp up here in the toolbar this icon

66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
right here that reads make corners sharp

67
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
when you hover your cursor over it if

68
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,399
it's grayed out then that means your

69
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,600
corners are already sharp and you're

70
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
good to go if you have rounded corners

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
go ahead and click that button and it'll

72
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
make your corner sharp

73
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
okay so let's convert this to a path now

74
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
let's go to path and select object to

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
path

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
and now we can grab the nodes tool which

77
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
is right here and i'm going to click and

78
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
drag over this node right here to select

79
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
it and i'm going to press delete on the

80
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
keyboard to get rid of that node

81
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
and then i'm going to click and drag

82
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
over the remaining three nodes and make

83
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
them sharp by clicking on this button up

84
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
here that says make selected nodes

85
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,879
corner

86
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
and now we have this triangle shape like

87
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,519
that

88
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
so let's go back to our select tool

89
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
let's give this a different color so we

90
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
can differentiate it from the leaf when

91
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,519
we apply it over i'm going to make this

92
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,640
red

93
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
and i'm going to right click this and go

94
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,440
to duplicate

95
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
and i'm going to make this one a

96
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,959
different color i'll make this one blue

97
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
and then i'll come up here where it says

98
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
flip selected objects vertically i'll do

99
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
that so it's flipped vertically and i'm

100
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
going to hold ctrl and move this one

101
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,200
down here like that now we want this to

102
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
attach to this right here so i'm going

103
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
to temporarily turn on snapping which is

104
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
this little magnet icon up here in the

105
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
top right corner and then you should be

106
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
able to just click and drag and snap it

107
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
in place like that and then we also want

108
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
to flip this horizontally so come over

109
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
here where it says flip selected objects

110
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
horizontally and select that this is

111
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,599
what we're looking for right here

112
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
so let's turn off snapping now

113
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,560
actually no you know what let's leave

114
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
that on for now i'm going to click and

115
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
drag over both of these objects

116
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,599
i'm going to group them together by

117
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
going to object

118
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,150
and selecting

119
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,840
[Music]

120
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
and then i'm just going to take this

121
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,640
bottom node right here or this bottom

122
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
handle and just bring this up so that we

123
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
end up with a shape like this so we have

124
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,959
these two triangles these two long

125
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,640
triangles going this way

126
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
and now i'm going to take my leaf let me

127
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
bring this over here let me make this a

128
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
little bigger i'm going to hold ctrl and

129
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
i'm going to click and drag this scaling

130
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,760
handle right here

131
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
to scale that up

132
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
and i want to take the corners this

133
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
corner of this object right here and

134
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,560
snap it

135
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
into this corner right here just like

136
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
that and now we can turn off our

137
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
snapping because if we leave that

138
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,280
enabled any further it's just going to

139
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
get in our way

140
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,480
so now we have our stem in place i'm

141
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
just going to hold ctrl and move this

142
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
over like this

143
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
i might even make this a little more a

144
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
little longer like that

145
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
and what's how this works is this red

146
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,238
object is going to represent the stem

147
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
and this blue object is actually going

148
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
to be used as negative space for this

149
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
leaf let me show you what i mean here

150
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
let's ungroup this object let's go to

151
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
object and select

152
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,880
ungroup and then click off of the

153
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
graphic to deselect everything i'm going

154
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
to select just this blue shape right

155
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
here and then i'm going to hold shift

156
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
and click on the green leaf right there

157
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
so we have both of them selected and i'm

158
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
going to subtract those two shapes from

159
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
each other by going to path

160
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
difference

161
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,639
and now we end up with something like

162
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,840
that right there

163
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
so let's click and drag over everything

164
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,479
here both of those objects and go to

165
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,840
path

166
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
union and now we have our base shape for

167
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,479
the leaf in fact we can take the opacity

168
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
of this and bring this back up and i'm

169
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
going to scale this down i'm going to

170
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,520
hold ctrl and to lock the proportions

171
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
and scale that down like that so we have

172
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
a rudimentary leaf here we're going to

173
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
make this look a little more whimsical

174
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
and and with curved edges uh by using

175
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
the pen tool so let me uh right click on

176
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
this and go to copy

177
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
or the pencil tool router come over here

178
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
to the pencil tool or the draw free hand

179
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
lines tool you can use the letter p on

180
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,680
your keyboard to access that

181
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
and up here where it says shape in the

182
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
tool setting we want to change that to

183
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
from clipboard

184
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,639
and the smoothing up here this is

185
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,800
important as well this is based on this

186
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
will vary based on your screen

187
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
resolution but i'm going to start out

188
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,560
with 60 and see how that looks

189
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
and now what i'm going to do is i'm just

190
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
going to click and drag like this to

191
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
create

192
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
a line like that and if you notice it

193
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
took that strap that it took that uh

194
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
shape and stretched it out along that

195
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,039
path

196
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
now the problem here is that the the

197
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
leaf is way too thin so let's come over

198
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
here to the edit pads my nodes tool

199
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
and there should be some little there

200
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
should be a little handle right here

201
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
that you could just pull out like this

202
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
and it increases

203
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
the size of your leaf as you can see

204
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,759
here

205
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,120
and this right here is the effect we're

206
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
going for

207
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
so let me make this green

208
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
let me remove the stroke by holding

209
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
shift and clicking on the red x over

210
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
here

211
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,319
and now i'm going to grab my selection

212
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
tool and scale this down to size a

213
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,560
little more a little more of a normal

214
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
size like that

215
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,880
and now what i'm going to do is i'm

216
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,319
going to finalize this by converting it

217
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
to a path i'll go to path

218
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,319
and select object to path

219
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,919
and we have a little bit of a whimsical

220
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
leaf here now the problem is i'm not too

221
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
happy with how these lines look they

222
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
don't look as fluid as they could be so

223
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,479
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

224
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
manually adjust them let me zoom in on

225
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
this by holding ctrl and rolling up the

226
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,680
mouse wheel

227
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
i'm going to grab my edit paths by nodes

228
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,880
tool i'm going to click on this object

229
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
to select it and if you see all of these

230
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
little nodes here going along this edge

231
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,120
i'm going to select all of those nodes

232
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
i'm going to hold shift while doing this

233
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
to make sure i can select multiple nodes

234
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
at a time and we want to have only these

235
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
nodes selected up here and then just

236
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
press delete on the keyboard to get rid

237
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
of them and now you should have these

238
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
two handles that you can adjust

239
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
according to your preference so i want

240
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,080
to give this more of a fluid contour

241
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,560
like that that looks a lot better so i'm

242
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,759
going to do the same thing down here now

243
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
i'm going to start selecting these nodes

244
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
while holding shift on my keyboard so i

245
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
can select multiple nodes at a time

246
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
and then press delete on the keyboard to

247
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
get rid of them

248
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
and now i can take this handle and

249
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
manually shape it

250
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,730
however i please

251
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,479
[Music]

252
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
okay there we go that looks a lot better

253
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
so let me grab the selection tool i'm

254
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
gonna press one on the keyboard to zoom

255
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
back out to a hundred percent and there

256
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
you go now we have one of our leaves

257
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
okay so let me show you another way you

258
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
can do this or actually let me just show

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
you how to make another leaf of another

260
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,879
uh style

261
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
instead of drawing the curved line like

262
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
it did before i'm going to draw like a

263
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
u-shaped line so i should still have

264
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
this copied to my clipboard we do have

265
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
the settings in place here from

266
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
clipboard i'm just going to click and

267
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
drag to create like a smiley face like

268
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
that

269
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
okay that didn't come out as expected

270
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
that looks really sloppy right there so

271
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
i'm going to press ctrl z to undo that

272
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
i'm going to increase the smoothing up

273
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,199
to 70.

274
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,380
and try that again

275
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,120
[Music]

276
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
okay that looks a little better that

277
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,759
that's not that's still not what i'm

278
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,039
looking for but that's enough for me to

279
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,240
work with so i'm going to leave it as it

280
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,319
is let me grab my selection tool let me

281
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
scale this down like that i'm going to

282
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
hold ctrl and shift while scaling so i

283
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
could scale from the center and preserve

284
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
the proportions

285
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
and i'm going to make this green

286
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
i'll remove the stroke by holding shift

287
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
and clicking the x

288
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
and i will go to path

289
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
object to path

290
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
and now i can go to my edit pads by

291
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
nodes tool and let me zoom in and clean

292
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
this up a little bit

293
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,000
press the delete key to get rid of those

294
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
nodes just like we did before same

295
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,360
process

296
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
take this handle and

297
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,480
take this handle and bring that in a

298
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,190
little bit

299
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,000
[Music]

300
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
there we go

301
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
[Music]

302
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
and then i will take these handle take

303
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
these nodes down here and get rid of

304
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
them

305
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
just like i did before just to make this

306
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
more smooth i missed one right there let

307
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,600
me get rid of that one there we go

308
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,480
so let me adjust this handle

309
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
and i think this one looks pretty good

310
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,080
yeah that's good enough and once you're

311
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
done you can grab the selection tool

312
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
zoom out to 100

313
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
by pressing one on the keyboard and

314
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,040
there we go now we have another leaf

315
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
and there you go you should get the idea

316
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
you can draw all of these different

317
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,399
whimsical style leaves by grabbing your

318
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
pencil tool over here and drawing

319
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
different contours as you can see there

320
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
like that or maybe not maybe not as

321
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
sloppy but you get the idea

322
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
okay

323
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
so there we go let me take this one

324
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,740
scale this down

325
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,120
[Music]

326
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
and there we go there is another leaf

327
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
okay so now we have all of these

328
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,080
different leaves and different shapes

329
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,279
going in different directions and

330
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,959
different contours and you could

331
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
actually arrange these to make somewhat

332
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
of a pattern or you can use these for

333
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
logos or icons or whatever else you'd

334
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,959
like

335
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,000
so i think that should do it for this

336
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
tutorial that is how you can draw simple

337
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
iconic leaves using inkscape before i

338
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
end this video if you found this lesson

339
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
useful then consider checking out my

340
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
inkscape master class it's a collection

341
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
of over 60 videos where i go over all of

342
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
the tools and features in inkscape and i

343
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
explain what they are and demonstrate

344
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
how they work kind of like how i did in

345
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
this video we even have a private

346
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
community where you can ask questions

347
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
and get help from me anytime you want

348
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
and best of all there's no monthly

349
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
membership fees you just pay 17 one time

350
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
and you're in for life i'll have some

351
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,920
information about that in the

352
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
description of the video if you want to
