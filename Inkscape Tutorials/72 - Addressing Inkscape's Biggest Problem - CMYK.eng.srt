00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,770
Inkscape is an incredible piece of

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,330
software that I've been using for over a

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,490
decade to create designs for myself and

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,919
my clients as much as I love Inkscape

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,660
though there's one particular problem

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,099
that has it I'll be addressing in this

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,840
video and I'll also be going over some

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,850
solutions for working around it as well

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,750
[Music]

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,859
this is Nick with logos by Nick comm and

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,779
in this video I'll be discussing how you

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,330
can work around ink scapes in ability to

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,700
generate files with the CMYK color

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,710
profile and if you'd like to learn more

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,300
about how Inkscape works be sure to

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
check out my Inkscape masterclass it's a

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,620
collection of over 60 videos where I go

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,510
over every tool and feature in Inkscape

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,640
and I explain what it is and demonstrate

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,350
how it works I'll have a link in the

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,640
description of the video if you want to

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,350
check that out so one of the biggest

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,329
downsides of working with Inkscape is

24
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,520
its inability to generate files with the

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,969
CMYK color profile this is problematic

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,710
when designing things for prints because

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,359
the only colors that can be generated

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,879
with ink are colors that are within the

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,580
CMYK color space

30
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,430
Inkscape by default works within the RGB

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,560
color space these are colors that are

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,659
generated using light and are intended

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,090
for use on screens and other electronics

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,280
with digital displays because of that

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,220
the RGB color space has a wider range of

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,740
colors to work with than CMYK does

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,360
because light can be used to generate

38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,610
more colors than ink n so if you create

39
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,560
a design with Inkscape then you go to

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,540
print it chances are you're going to be

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,909
using colors that are out of gamut or in

42
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,890
other words not within the range of what

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,409
can be created with ink most print shops

44
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,329
will refuse to print your document if

45
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,829
this is the case because they know that

46
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,299
you're not going to be happy with the

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,310
result now you may think to yourself

48
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,170
okay I'll just use colors that are

49
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,659
within the CMYK color space that it

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,570
should be fine right well not exactly

51
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,040
it's a little more complicated than just

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,310
using CMYK colors every document has a

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,710
color profile embedded within it and if

54
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,540
you created that document with Inkscape

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,030
then it's going to have an RGB profile

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,159
because that's the only format Inkscape

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,469
supports the problem with printing an

58
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,330
RGB document is that you're taking

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,919
colors that were originally generated

60
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,400
using light

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,170
and trying to reproduce them with ink

62
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,569
this usually results in their finished

63
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,700
printed product having colors that look

64
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,530
dull and muddy and just overall

65
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,120
different than they did on your screen

66
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,040
when you design them even if you made

67
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,900
sure to only use colors that work within

68
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,659
the CMYK color space it's just not

69
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,370
possible for something to look the same

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,220
in print as it does on your screen if

71
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,560
you're creating it in an RGB color

72
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,900
profile and because of that a lot of

73
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,640
print shops will immediately turn down

74
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,560
your document if they see that it has an

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,440
RGB profile embedded now some print

76
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,269
shops will do a spot conversion and

77
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,190
adjust the colors for you this is

78
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,079
actually becoming a lot more common and

79
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,670
a good example of this would be Vista

80
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,129
Print I've printed RGB documents with

81
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,510
them in the past and the results were

82
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,430
actually pretty good but they weren't

83
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,650
perfect the best way to ensure that your

84
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,989
design will look the same in print as it

85
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,239
does on your device is to make sure that

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,849
your document is using a CMYK color

87
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,549
profile in illustrator this can be done

88
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,129
by going to file document color mode and

89
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,670
choosing CMYK color an affinity designer

90
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,379
this can be done by going to file

91
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,230
document setup clicking on the color tab

92
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,169
and choosing CMYK from the color format

93
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,599
drop-down Inkscape however lacks the

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,069
ability to do this and it's one of the

95
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,840
biggest downsides of working with it in

96
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,909
my opinion designing things for print is

97
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,829
just going to be more challenging in

98
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,690
Inkscape but it's not impossible

99
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,669
there are some workarounds for creating

100
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,980
a CMYK document from your Inkscape

101
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,750
designs and I'd like to share some of

102
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,909
them with you in this video now I must

103
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,799
warn you in advance that these methods

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,909
are far from perfect

105
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,650
but they will get the job done and they

106
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,579
are better than nothing

107
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,000
if you're a Linux user there's a

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
third-party extension that you can

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,299
install for Inkscape that will allow you

110
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,180
to export PDF documents with a CMYK

111
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,879
color profile the extension is called

112
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,030
export PDF CMYK and I'll have a link in

113
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,500
the description for those of you who are

114
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,299
linux users and want to try it out I

115
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,220
haven't tried it myself but I've heard

116
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,079
good things the benefit of using

117
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,849
something like this is that it allows

118
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,190
you to export your design in an editable

119
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,320
vector format where you can manually

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,108
adjust the DPI which is also important

121
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,120
for printing documents the downside

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,010
though is that you can only export a PDF

123
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,410
document so if your print shop requires

124
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,380
a rasterized format like jpg or TI F

125
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,780
you're out of luck the other downside is

126
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,880
that it's only for Linux users so those

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,650
of us on Windows and Mac are also out of

128
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,580
luck

129
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,320
Scribus is an open-source application

130
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
for desktop publishing similar to Adobe

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
InDesign and it's available for all

132
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,860
three operating systems one great thing

133
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,660
about Scribus is that it allows you to

134
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,970
open PDF documents that were originally

135
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,220
created with Inkscape and manually

136
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,740
change the colors based on a CMYK color

137
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,530
profile then once you're done you can

138
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,050
export your design as a PDF document and

139
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,510
you will now have a print ready document

140
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,270
with a CMYK color profile embedded I

141
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,550
made an entire tutorial about how to do

142
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,840
this a few years ago if you want to

143
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,430
check that out I'll have it linked into

144
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,360
the description of the video

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,150
much like the Linux extension the upside

146
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,220
of using Scribus is that you can get an

147
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,650
editable vector format that most print

148
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,530
shops overwhelmingly accept the downside

149
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,540
though is that this only works on pure

150
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,330
vector pads if your design uses a lot of

151
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,790
Inkscape specific features like Gaussian

152
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,030
blurs masking clipped objects filters

153
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,130
and so on they're not going to translate

154
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,680
over to Scribus unfortunately in that

155
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,850
case you'll have to generate a

156
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,490
rasterized PNG file and use a different

157
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,030
solution

158
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,320
Krita is an open-source design

159
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,210
application that functions sort of like

160
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,460
a hybrid between Inkscape and it

161
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,930
allows you to work with and create

162
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,060
vector objects but it also allows you to

163
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,700
paint and manipulate images as well one

164
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,830
major benefit of use in Krita is that it

165
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,010
has the ability to export CMYK documents

166
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,110
already built-in there is a catch though

167
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,540
you won't be able to export your design

168
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,150
in a vector format like SVG or PDF

169
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,610
credit does allow you to export in these

170
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,860
formats but unfortunately your document

171
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,690
will be forced into having an RGB color

172
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,390
profile Krita is ideal if you need a

173
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,170
flattened raster format like PNG jpg and

174
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,960
TI F those formats can be exported with

175
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,840
the CMYK color profile to do so first

176
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,120
export your design from Inkscape as a

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,640
PNG file then open it up with credit

178
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,820
then navigate to image properties and

179
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,580
under the image color space tab select

180
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,310
the CMYK option from the model drop-down

181
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,740
from there you can export your design in

182
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,480
any restor format and it will have a

183
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,639
print ready CMYK color profile embedded

184
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,560
another way that you can convert your

185
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,500
Inkscape document to CMYK is to use a

186
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,539
web-based color conversion service

187
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,340
there's a lot of them out there but the

188
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,620
one I'm most familiar with would be RGB

189
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,159
to CMYK org this allows you to take a

190
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,770
PNG file that you exported from Inkscape

191
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,560
and convert it to either jpg or TI F

192
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,409
format with the CMYK color profile

193
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,300
embedded the benefit of using a site

194
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,620
like this is that it's quick and

195
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,759
convenient and you won't have to

196
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,949
download any additional software the

197
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,569
downside though is that you're limited

198
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,969
to only those two formats and another

199
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,349
problem I've noticed with web-based

200
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,389
converters like this is that they tend

201
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,939
to produce inconsistent results and you

202
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,529
don't get to see how the final design

203
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,479
looks before saving it I've had

204
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,430
instances where the final design looks

205
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,169
so different from the original in terms

206
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,840
of color that it was hardly usable

207
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,360
the final solution for generating a CMYK

208
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,120
document from your Inkscape design is to

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,790
simply save it as an SVG file then open

210
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,410
it up with illustrator or affinity

211
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,660
designer and correct the colors yourself

212
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,880
personally I think this is the best way

213
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,070
to approach the CMYK problem as an

214
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,810
Inkscape user because it gives you the

215
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,850
most control with all of the other

216
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,710
methods I discussed you're basically

217
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,510
just taking your document and swapping

218
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,310
out the color profile without ever

219
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,500
having an opportunity to correct your

220
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
colors once they've been converted

221
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,370
illustrator allows you to do that though

222
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,169
and I have an entire tutorial about

223
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,260
converting RGB colors to CMYK while

224
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,330
maintaining their vibrance on my other

225
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,770
channel if you want to check that out

226
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,419
I'll have that link in the description

227
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,280
as well this is actually what I do

228
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,710
myself since Inkscape is the software

229
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm most familiar with it's what I use

230
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,639
for most of my design work and that does

231
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,289
include designs that are made for print

232
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,630
once I'm finished creating my design in

233
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,580
Inkscape I simply open it up with

234
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,120
illustrator set the color mode to CMYK

235
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,799
adjust the colors as needed and then

236
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,570
export it to whatever format I'd like

237
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,550
and that's another benefit of using this

238
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,950
approach you're not confined to just PDF

239
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,650
or just jpg you can save your work in

240
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,720
any format imaginable and it'll have a

241
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,839
CMYK color profile embedded you can even

242
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,160
save your work directly as an

243
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,230
illustrator file which believe it or not

244
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,690
some print shops do require the same can

245
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,130
be done with affinity designer as well

246
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,280
just open your Inkscape SVG change the

247
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,280
document color mode to CMYK adjust your

248
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,500
colors as needed then save your work to

249
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,839
whatever format you'd like I understand

250
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,820
that these two applications are not free

251
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,950
and because of that this may not be a

252
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,290
feasible option for some of you until

253
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,510
Inkscape implements some kind of support

254
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,410
for CMYK

255
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,360
this is the best option we have and I

256
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,190
would highly recommend it if you are in

257
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,200
a position to acquire one of these two

258
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,390
programs if not that any of the other

259
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,680
methods that were discussed in this

260
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
video should work just fine that should

261
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,490
do it for today's video if you have any

262
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,290
questions leave a comment below and as

263
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,290
always thanks for watching
