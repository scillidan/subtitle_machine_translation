00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,519
this is nick with logosbynic.com and in

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
this lesson we'll be going over how you

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
can create multi-page documents using

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
inkscape now in order to follow along

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,680
with this lesson you'll need to update

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
to version 1.2 which was just released

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,279
yesterday because this is a new feature

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,279
to inkscape if you remember a couple of

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,560
years ago i made a tutorial

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
demonstrating how to design pdf reports

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
and ebooks and various types of

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
multi-page documents but because

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
inkscape didn't have the ability to do

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
this at the time we had to save each

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,079
page as an individual pdf and then merge

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,440
them together using a third-party

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,719
application

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
but thanks to version 1.2 those days are

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,039
over so let's get started here and

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,800
demonstrate how this works so when you

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,039
open up inkscape version 1.2 this should

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,879
be your view when you first open a new

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
document this white square right here or

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
rectangle rather represents your page

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,559
now if you notice down here at the

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,000
bottom of the tools menu you'll see you

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,799
have a new tool here called the create

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
and edit document pages tool if you

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,520
click on that it'll activate nodes on

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
your page right here and you can take

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,799
these nodes and use them to scale them

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
and change the size of your document and

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
you could even move your document around

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
the workspace like this if you need to

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
do that

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
now what you can also do with this tool

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
is you can click and drag like this to

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
create another page like that and now

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
you have two different pages here

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
okay now if you want to create an exact

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
copy of a page you already have what you

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
can do is you can click on one of those

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
pages and you come up here to the tools

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
menu bar at the top of the screen and

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,079
click on this little icon right here

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,000
that says create a new page and when you

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,439
click on that it's going to create a new

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,840
page in the same dimensions that the

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
current page that you have selected is

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
so this new page is the same size as

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
this page over here

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
now if you look over here through this

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,799
drop down we have all of these different

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,159
pre-made templates that you can choose

56
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,520
from if you want to change the size of

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
your page to something specific say for

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
example if you're designing a us letter

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
8.5 by 11 inches you can change it to

60
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,159
that right there and there you go now

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,799
you have 8.5 by 11 inch document and

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,318
then again you could change this using

63
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
these nodes at any time just as you

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
would with the original page

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
okay so looking up through these uh menu

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
items right here let's go over what each

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
of these things do now if you notice

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
over here as i click on these different

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
pages you'll see up here they are

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
ordered one through three this is page

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
one of three

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
this is page two of three and this is

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
page three of three this represents the

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
order of the pages so if i were to save

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
this as a pdf document this would be the

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
first page this would be the second page

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
and this would be the third page if i

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
want to change their order at any point

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
all i have to do is select one of them

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
and then on either side of the order

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
right here we have this one that says

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
move page backwards

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
and now that will be page two of three

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,879
even though nothing visibly changes on

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,160
the canvas if i were to save this

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
document this would be page one

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
this would be page two and then this

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
would be page three so let me go ahead

89
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
and undo that

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,480
so now this is one this is two and this

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,640
is three and then up here we have names

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,879
you can name each page if you want this

93
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
is really just for personal reference

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,599
this isn't going to change the name of

95
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
your document or anything this is just

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
for example if you want to change this

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,120
to

98
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,879
um i don't know like something like

99
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
brochure contents

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
there you go

101
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
and then over here you could write in

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
um

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
business card

104
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,519
just in case you know naming your pages

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,879
comes in handy in some way so that's

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,640
what that does and if you want to delete

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
any of your pages what you could do is

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
you can select on it like that click on

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
it with the tool and you could either

110
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
press delete on your keyboard

111
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,480
or you can click on this button over

112
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
here that says delete the selected page

113
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
okay so let me go ahead and undo that

114
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
let me show you what these other tools

115
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,519
in here do what i'm going to do is i'm

116
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
going to grab the stars tool and create

117
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
a star right on top of this page right

118
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
here

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
now if i go back to the pages tool if

120
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
you notice i have this option right here

121
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
that says move overlapping objects as

122
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
the page is moved this means that if i

123
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
move the page the object will move with

124
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
it so if i move this page you'll notice

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
the object is fixed in place it's not

126
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
moving anywhere

127
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
that's because i have that setting

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
turned off if i turn that setting on now

129
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
when i move a page the contents of the

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
page will be moved along with it like

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
that as you can see there

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
okay so that's how that works and then

133
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
finally over here we have fit the page

134
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
to the current selection or the drawing

135
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,800
so if i have an object selected let me

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
grab my selection tool

137
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
if i have an object selected like that

138
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
i can come back over here to the create

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
and edit document pages and i can click

140
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
on this button right here that says fit

141
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
the pages to the current selection of

142
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
the drawing if i click on that you see

143
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
what happens there the page is now fit

144
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
to the size of that document right there

145
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
or that object right there so that's how

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,680
that works

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
so let me give you a working

148
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
demonstration of how you can save a

149
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
multi-page document now so let me take

150
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
this and get rid of this i'm going to

151
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
grab the text tool i'm just going to

152
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
this is just for an example here you

153
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
don't have to follow along with what i'm

154
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
doing i'm just going to put some numbers

155
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
on the page

156
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
like this i'm gonna put this over here

157
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
just so you can visualize how this works

158
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
this is page one this is gonna be page

159
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
two and this is gonna be page three and

160
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
what i'm gonna do now is in order to

161
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
save this as a multi-page document i'm

162
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
gonna go to file and i'm gonna go to

163
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
save as and i want to choose pdf down

164
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
here

165
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
and i'll click save

166
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
leave all of the defaults as they are

167
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
click ok and now what i'm going to do is

168
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
i'm going to go and open up that pdf

169
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
document and show you how it works

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
okay so as you can see here i've opened

171
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,479
up my multi-page pdf document that i've

172
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,720
created thanks to inkscape version 1.2

173
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
and as you can see everything is in its

174
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
order this was page one this was page

175
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
two and this was page three

176
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
so that is how you can create multi-page

177
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
documents using inkscape if you found

178
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
this lesson useful then consider

179
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
checking out my inkscape master class

180
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,680
it's a collection of over 60 videos

181
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,199
where i go over all of the tools and

182
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,199
features in inkscape and i explain what

183
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,960
they are and demonstrate how they work

184
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
kind of like how i just did in this
