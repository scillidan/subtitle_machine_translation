00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,719
this is nick with logosbynick.com and in

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,400
this tutorial i'll be demonstrating how

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
you can take a vector object and apply

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,640
this very quick and simple sketch effect

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,119
to it using the hatches path effect in

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,320
inkscape

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,920
so to get us started here i'm going to

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
apply this effect to a really simple

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,359
shape first so let me get this out of

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
the way i'm going to grab the circles

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,720
and ellipses tool and i'm going to click

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,920
and drag on the canvas to create a

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
circle like that i'll hold ctrl to make

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,200
this perfectly round

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
so i'm going to apply the sketch effect

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,000
to this shape and then we'll go ahead

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
and apply it to some text

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
so the first thing we want to do is open

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
up the path effects menu so i'm going to

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
come up here to where it says path and

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,399
i'm going to click on path effects

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
and you're going to get this little menu

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,879
over here in the right hand side of the

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
screen and what we're looking for down

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,320
here is where this little plus icon is

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
you click on that to add a new path

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
effect and you're going to see you have

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
this whole list of different path

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
effects to choose from the one that we

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
are looking for is right here it's

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,239
called hatches if you're having

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,840
difficulty locating it you can come up

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
here to the search bar and just type in

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
hatches and there you go there it is

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,479
okay so once we apply that as you can

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
see it took the object and filled it

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
with these lines otherwise known as

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
hatches and what you can do now is grab

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
the edit paths by nodes tool and if you

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
notice let me zoom in on this a little

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,240
bit

43
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
if you notice we have these green nodes

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
right here we have this one green node

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
and then we have this green node and

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
then down here we have this yellow node

47
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
and then we have this yellow node so let

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
me show you how this works this first

49
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
green node right here if you click and

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
drag it it allows you to change the

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,600
position of the hatches on the object

52
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,759
this green node over here allows you to

53
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
change the density and the direction of

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
the hatches so if i bring the green node

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
closer to the other green node it makes

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
the hatches more dense like that so it

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
fills in more of the shape and then if

58
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
you rotate it around like that you can

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
change the direction of it

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,119
so let me place this right about here

61
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
over here we have um

62
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,119
this these yellow handles right here

63
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,880
represent the bend so you what you can

64
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
do is take this one handle and give this

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
object a bend like that by clicking and

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,280
dragging it out like that and this other

67
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
yellow handle represents the start point

68
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
of that bend so if you were to take this

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,318
over here notice the two handles are

70
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
moving together if i put this one over

71
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,000
here this will be the start point and

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
then over here this will be the end

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
point and i can move this all the way

74
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,200
out like that and you can as you can see

75
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
we are creating quite an intense bend

76
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
there so let me put that back towards

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
the original one because i don't want

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
this to have much of a bend at all i'll

79
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
put this back in the center of the

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
object and let me zoom out a little bit

81
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
i'm going to grab the select tool now

82
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
let's say we want to make these hatches

83
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
thicker or larger what you can do is

84
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
just scale down the object using the

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
select tool i'm going to hold ctrl so

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
that it scales proportionately scale it

87
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,160
down like that and as you can see it

88
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
makes the hatches bigger if you scale it

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
down if you scale it up it makes them

90
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
thinner so let me scale this down a

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
little bit so i get a nice a nice size

92
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
hatch that i like right there that looks

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
pretty good and after you do that you

94
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
may want to edit the um you may want to

95
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
go back to the nodes tool and edit the

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
the density of those hatches as you can

97
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
see here make them a little closer

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
together like that

99
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
and once you're finished applying this

100
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
effect you can finalize it by going to

101
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,720
path

102
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,159
object to path

103
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
and now that is a vector path and no

104
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
longer a path effect

105
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,519
okay so that is how you can create that

106
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,080
simple sketch effect for like a regular

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
object let me show you how to do this

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,959
with text now

109
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
i'm going to grab the text tool

110
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,799
right over here click on the canvas and

111
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,080
i'm going to write

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,599
sketch

113
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
and i'm going to change the font of that

114
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
i'm going to go to text text and font

115
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
and i'm looking for

116
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
i'm going to use a heavy font for this

117
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
i'm going to use chunk 5. you can use

118
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
whatever font you'd like but i'd

119
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
recommend using a really bold

120
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
heavyweight font click apply

121
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,840
let me grab the select tool and scale

122
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
this up

123
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
hold ctrl so it locks the proportions

124
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
like that

125
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
now the thing with these path effects

126
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,480
with this sketch or this this uh hatch's

127
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
path effect it only works on pads it

128
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
won't work on objects that aren't pads

129
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,840
this right here is a text object so that

130
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
the hatch's path effect won't work on

131
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
this unless we convert it to a path

132
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
so in order to change this from a text

133
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
object to a path we just select it and

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
go to path

135
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
object to path

136
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
and now i can come back up here to my

137
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
path effects menu add that path effect

138
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
again there it is hatches

139
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,959
and if you notice here there's not much

140
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,238
visibility there because there's not

141
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
much density between those hatches so

142
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
let me zoom in

143
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
let me grab the edit pads by nodes tool

144
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
and i'm going to take this green handle

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
and bring it towards the original like

146
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
that and as you can see we are getting

147
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
the sketch effect as we intended

148
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
there we go that looks pretty good right

149
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
there now i'm going to zoom out

150
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,919
and to finalize this i will go back to

151
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,639
the select tool i'll go to path

152
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
object to path and there you go now we

153
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,759
have our simple sketch effect that we

154
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,160
have created using inkscape

155
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
if you found this lesson useful be sure

156
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
to check out my inkscape master class

157
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
it's a collection of over 60 videos

158
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
where i go over all of the tools and

159
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
features in inkscape just like i did in

160
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
this video and i explain what they are

161
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
and demonstrate how they work we even

162
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
have a private community where you can

163
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
answer ask questions and get help from

164
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
me anytime you want i'll have a link in
