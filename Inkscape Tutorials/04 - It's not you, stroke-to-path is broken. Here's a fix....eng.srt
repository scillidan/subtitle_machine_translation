00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,120
in this tutorial I'll be addressing a

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,800
bug that exists in the current version

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,960
of inkscape where converting a stroke to

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,799
a path gives you a different result than

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,719
what you expect and to show you what I

6
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,200
mean I have this simple fourpoint shape

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
that is a stroke and if I convert this

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,239
stroke to a path you can see what

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,840
happens we end up with a broken shape

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,359
now this is not what's supposed to

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,000
happen so I would imagine this is some

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
kind of bug in the software now the

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,720
inkscape team is usually good with

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,240
addressing these sorts of things so I'm

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
sure this will be ironed out in the next

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,679
update but in this tutorial I just want

17
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,840
to show you a simple fix for this so let

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,879
me press contrl Z to undo what I did

19
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,480
there what I'm going to do is I'm going

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,719
to select the object and now before I

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,239
convert it to a stroke I will go to path

22
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,600
and I will select reverse and now if I

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,920
go to path and select stroke to path you

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,320
can see we end up with the result as

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,680
intended now I don't know much about the

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
back end of this software and how this

27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,840
sort of thing works but I would imagine

28
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,879
it has something to do with how the

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,680
start and end point of a path is defined

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,640
because the reverse function is normally

31
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,119
only used when we place text on a path

32
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:05,880
and we want to define whether the text

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,720
goes on the outside of the path or the

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,880
inside of the path but in this instance

35
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,280
it's also useful here as well another

36
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,520
thing you can do you can also flip the

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
object so if I were to press the letter

38
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,720
H on my keyboard and flip it

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
horizontally that will also work the

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,759
same way and I would imagine because it

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
reverses the path the same way path

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
reverse does and then after that you

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,400
could just press h again and then it's

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
back to the starting point so that

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,640
should do it for today's video I just

46
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,479
wanted to get this fix out there in case

47
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,159
you were encountering this problem and

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,960
it was frustrating you if you have any

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,479
questions leave a comment below and as

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,920
always thanks for watching
