1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,399
in this tutorial we'll be going over how

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,100
you can rasterize Vector objects in

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,140
inkscape more importantly though we'll

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,700
be going over why you would want to do

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,040
such a thing so let's get started here

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,080
on my canvas I have this example design

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,120
which consists of individual Vector

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,619
elements if I zoom in on this you can

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,600
see there's no quality loss

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,180
if I wanted to make a rasterized or a

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,640
pixel based copy of this design here all

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,760
I have to do is Select it and go to edit

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,480
and select make a bitmap copy

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
and when you do that it creates a copy

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,100
of your selection only it's a pixel

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,020
based copy so if I zoom in on this you

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,840
can see this is indeed a pixel based

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,760
image

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,500
now let's have a look at an example of

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,480
when this sort of thing would be useful

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,760
so on my screen here I have this

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,739
halftone pattern that we created in a

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,420
previous tutorial and this actually

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,520
serves as a perfect example of when to

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,140
use this sort of thing because this

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,539
design here consists of hundreds maybe

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,000
even thousands of tiny little circles

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
and because of that the software has to

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
process the information of each and

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
every one of these elements which can

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,760
slow down the software and decrease

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,979
performance so this is where making a

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,780
bitmap copy comes in handy because it

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,760
allows you to create a pixel based copy

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,460
which will free up a lot of CPU usage

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,560
and make the software run a lot better

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
open my layers menu I'm going to come up

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,420
here to layers and select layers and

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,280
objects

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,320
and I'm going to look for

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,000
here we go Layer Two this is where all

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,159
of the objects remain on this layer I'm

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,540
going to select the objects I want to

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,920
make a copy of

46
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
and if I go to edit and select make a

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,380
bitmap copy we now have an image over

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,759
here in the layers menu so I'm going to

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,200
take this image and I'm going to pop it

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
out of the layer and place it on top of

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
the layer and if I scroll up you can see

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
it up there and then I'm going to

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,159
collapse the layer

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,259
and I'm going to lock the layer and turn

55
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,420
off the visibility of the layer and now

56
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,840
we have just this pixel based image here

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,540
and now the software is already running

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,939
much smoother if I try doing this and

59
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,740
working with this with thousands of

60
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,420
individual little elements being

61
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,160
displayed on the screen it's going to

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,280
decrease performance by a lot now one

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,660
problem you may encounter when doing

64
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,220
this sort of thing if I zoom in here you

65
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,739
can see the resolution isn't too great

66
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,599
so if you want to make bitmap copies

67
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,520
while preserving a higher resolution

68
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
than what the default is what I would

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
recommend doing is going into inkscape

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,520
preferences if you're a Windows or Linux

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,140
User it's up here in the edit menu and

72
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,400
come down here to where it says either

73
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
preferences or inkscape preferences if

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,300
you're using Mac just come over here to

75
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,980
where it says inkscape and select

76
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,959
settings

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,940
and in the menu what we're looking for

78
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
is over here where it says imported

79
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,540
images I'm going to come down here to

80
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,040
where it says resolution for create a

81
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,160
bitmap copy the default is 96. I'm going

82
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,680
to change that to 300. and then close

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,900
out of the menu and now next time when

84
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,360
you make a bitmap copy it'll be a much

85
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
higher resolution so let me show you

86
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,420
here as an example let me get rid of my

87
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,360
other copy and let me make a new copy

88
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,660
of my halftones here I'm going to select

89
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,160
all of my halftones

90
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll go to edit make a bitmap copy

91
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
take the image layer pop that out

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,780
collapse the layer

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,940
turn this off

94
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,400
and there we go this is a much higher

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,080
resolution like I'm zooming in Beyond

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,659
100 and you don't see any pixelation yet

97
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,519
in fact I could zoom in quite a bit

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,080
without any kind of pixelation

99
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,599
whatsoever I have to go pretty far there

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,980
before you start seeing the pixelation

101
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
so that's a little tip that you can use

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,060
to help create higher resolution copies

103
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,180
of your rasterize objects if you found

104
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,680
this lesson useful then consider

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
checking out my inkscape master class

106
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,819
it's a collection of over 60 videos

107
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,440
where I go over all of the tools and

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,480
features in inkscape and I explain what

109
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
they are and demonstrate how they work

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,620
kind of like how I did in this video we

111
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,299
even have a private Community where you

112
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,099
can ask questions and get help from me

113
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,620
anytime you want and best of all there's

114
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,599
no monthly membership fees you just pay

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,019
17 one time and you're in for Life I'll

116
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,340
have some information about that down

117
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,019
below if you want to check that out as

118
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,220
always thanks for watching

119
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,240
[Music]

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,600
thank you
