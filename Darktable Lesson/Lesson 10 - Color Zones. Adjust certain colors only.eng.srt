00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,509
this video we'll be doing the color

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,669
zones module and learning how to use it

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,740
color zones you can find it down here

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,389
under more modules this is an

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,579
alphabetical order just go down to color

7
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:16,529
zones and then we'll just click it and

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,449
make sure that appears and that's how we

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,089
got this effect here so what we did we

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,119
took our original image or our base

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,009
image and then we just adjusted the

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,390
color so we've got some more pink and

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,369
purple instead of what the original was

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,960
with like this red paint you can

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,720
download this image from we saturate on

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,770
through the link in the description this

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,690
video if you want to follow along

18
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,070
there's a really good image for using

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,440
this tool so the color zones when we

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,060
select it we have some different options

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,190
we have it shows us a bunch of little

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,440
colored boxes and when we hover our

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,720
mouse over it does this sort of weird

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,200
squiggly type thing we can adjust the

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,000
size and the influence of it with our

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,650
scroll wheel and then we have lightness

27
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,880
saturation and the chart kind of changes

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,430
for saturation and we have hue and the

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,140
chart will change for that as well well

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,910
the what I did for to create that look

31
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,610
let's just go back and go to compress

32
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,560
history stack so this is kind of back to

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,650
the base now what I first did I went to

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,370
hue and we selected by hue well actually

35
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,360
let's start with the beginning

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,760
lightness so we can select certain

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,940
colors certain pixel color groups within

38
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,520
this image and adjust the lightness of

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,040
just those colors so to do this we can

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
need to look on the chart and

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,550
approximate with our eye or we can click

42
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,620
and get the color picker here and we can

43
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,720
drag this around to a certain point so

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,330
if we drag it to these yellows it draws

45
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,060
a an indicator to see that there's like

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,190
a black line now that wasn't there

47
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,610
before

48
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,350
in right in the middle of these yellows

49
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,890
and so that shows us where that kind of

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,100
falls the zone that these colors are in

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,500
and then we can just left click on these

52
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,590
and we can increase the lightness or the

53
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,869
darkness of just those colors let's zoom

54
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,580
out I'm hitting the control wheel on my

55
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,758
mouse the scroll wheel so if we adjust

56
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,919
that we see where it's changing just the

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,810
darkness of that yellow but it's keeping

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,840
it the same

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,420
Hieu if we double-click it'll reset to

60
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,459
zero we can also adjust the saturation

61
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,769
so our mark is still there that black

62
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,050
line is still there we can give it less

63
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,150
if we go down it's less saturation all

64
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,519
the way to pretty close we can go to

65
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,379
black and white I think or we can give

66
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,510
it more saturation all the way up to

67
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,510
really kind of unrealistic looking

68
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,090
unnatural looking double-click brings

69
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,370
that back into normal and the hue is

70
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,440
kind of the fun one so the hue is what

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,450
lets us take it where it's at right now

72
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,610
is sort of this yellowish greenish color

73
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,920
and if we move it up we can move it into

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,579
a more green or more blue I'm getting my

75
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,660
mouse out of the way because it has this

76
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,640
yellow thing around it so you can't see

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
very well with it but if we drag it down

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,160
it'll go into the blues or purpley we

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,129
get really down into those blues and if

80
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,079
we bring it up we can get it into also

81
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,629
well blues it's sort of it sort of loops

82
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,010
over again so once you get to the very

83
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,319
top it loops over back to the bottom but

84
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,269
we can get some greens in there so we

85
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,799
can keep those greens you see it looks a

86
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,709
little bit maybe not so realistic so we

87
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,920
can take down the saturation now so we

88
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,150
can bring down the saturation a little

89
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,430
bit or bring down the lightness a little

90
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,280
bit of those so that looks more like

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,349
kind of more like paint and then we can

92
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,700
do the same thing we can create another

93
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
instance of this this is something we

94
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,280
haven't really learned yet I don't think

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,590
if we click this icon here and go to new

96
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,470
instance now we have a color zones one

97
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,420
so we have color zones

98
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,630
where to go we have covers owns that we

99
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,030
just did then we have color zones one so

100
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,590
under cover zones one we can do the same

101
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,590
thing to this other side we select sort

102
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,109
of the colors that those are at and then

103
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,760
we can do the same thing change the hue

104
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,489
of just those colors and so we can make

105
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,319
those from sort of more purple like and

106
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,709
change the saturation of those and the

107
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,329
lightness of those as well if we want to

108
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,060
darker or lighter you will go darker on

109
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,849
that so we've really kind of made we've

110
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,900
changed the way this looks without

111
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,819
affecting the whites that's kind of the

112
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,930
problem a lot of times when you're

113
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,489
trying to change the color of something

114
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,630
you might go to grab this even my color

115
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,579
balance is gonna adjust the colors of

116
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,590
the back of everything so the whites

117
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,460
gets kind of thrown off a little bit

118
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,310
color correction here is one that's a

119
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,560
really good thing but it it's good when

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,030
you don't have a lot of whites for when

121
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,430
you're okay adjusting your white balance

122
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,650
because it changes the way your whites

123
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,410
look well the way we've done it we were

124
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,210
able to adjust these colors using the

125
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,850
color zones without affecting any other

126
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,770
colors let's look at one more example

127
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,600
since this is a super fun and super

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,669
powerful tool here's a car that looks

129
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,620
pretty cool but we see I've adjusted a

130
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,300
little bit in the background there this

131
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,830
is what the original looked like so it

132
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,979
was a blue car and then after the using

133
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,530
well I use color zones and zones on it

134
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,910
to give us some more kind of contrast

135
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,110
but so we can just go down to just that

136
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,180
base curve again compress history stack

137
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,639
and we'll grab not color correction

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,080
because color correction we know what

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,419
that does is make it look it adjusts

140
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,280
everything so we don't do color

141
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,850
correction we do color zones and the

142
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,530
color is own we just find those blues we

143
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,030
can even just click in here and just

144
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,620
eyeball it without having to get the

145
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,600
color picker and we can make them make

146
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,910
it a lighter blue color we can go to the

147
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,160
hue and make it a different color

148
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,860
altogether we can make it more green we

149
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,389
can kind of bring that over and make it

150
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,270
more of a purple and without affecting

151
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,919
the brick and the rest of the building

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,650
so really really cool stuff that we can

153
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,150
do here and we didn't have to do any

154
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,260
masking at all to achieve this look so

155
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,310
it's really cool and we could do the

156
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,720
same thing with the bricks if we want to

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,789
do we could grab the color picker select

158
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55,460
the bricks the bricks are over here so

159
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,570
we could change the color of the

160
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,080
building

161
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,020
give it more you know have it look a

162
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,240
little different color as well or we

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
could leave it the same color and change

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870
the the darkness of it make it really a

165
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,260
darker building or make it look lighter

166
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,130
but one more thing I wanted to mention

167
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,229
about this these zones do have these

168
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,210
little triangles here at the bottom so

169
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,919
if we want to let's bring that back kind

170
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
of how it was this one with the car if

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
we find that zone that that's in we can

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,389
adjust these triangles and get a little

173
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,979
bit more accurate kind of makes this

174
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,919
more sharp and more pronounced so see

175
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,510
what that's doing as we click these

176
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,960
triangles it sort of makes that

177
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,340
selection area a little bit different

178
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,710
but these triangles correspond with node

179
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,870
with these circles the triangles

180
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,090
one with these circle nodes so if ever

181
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,650
there's a like if we want to select in

182
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,630
between these two there's a circle here

183
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
and a circle here if you want to select

184
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,260
in between the two bring one of these

185
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,250
over to that point and that's that

186
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,320
I think this world will do it now in the

187
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,820
there's another module called just

188
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,060
what's it called zones any but let's

189
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,580
find that zone system so the zone system

190
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,220
you can have some control over this too

191
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,080
but just without colors anyway I just

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,370
want to throw it out there appreciate

193
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,870

194
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,190
