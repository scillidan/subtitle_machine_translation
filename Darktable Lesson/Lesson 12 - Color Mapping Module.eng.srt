00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,680
welcome to another darktable tutorial

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,060
today we're going to learn how to use

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,519
the color mapping module which will let

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,869
us take an image this is just like a

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,669
JPEG image I just downloaded from

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,519
pixabay and as a certain look to it but

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,800
we can use the color mapping module to

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,519
kind of map similar colors in certain

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,960
images so these are all this original

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,210
images for the most part they haven't

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,009
been edited at least not in darktable

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,839
they probably have been edited to kind

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,999
of achieve this look but we don't have

14
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,430
the history stack so if we want to kind

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,760
of replicate a certain look we can do

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,550
that using the color mapping module so

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,440
under more modules we just go down it's

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,360
in alphabetical order so we find color

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,340
mapping which is this one right here and

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,350
we click it and it enables it up top

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,270
here and so now this is the color

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,550
mapping module and we see it's already

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm not sure if it's grabbing this or if

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,580
this is from what I was using last time

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,800
but if we get something maybe like this

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,450
one we go back to the original of this

27
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,350
and see what it looked like

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,950
we can choose to acquire a source or

29
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,140
acquire a target and it's called acquire

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,120
but really it's putting the the colors

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,400
on to a target but when we do acquire

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,050
source it'll grab whatever we're looking

33
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,950
at at this current level of history and

34
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,560
it will just acquire if we have it set

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,870
up for three it'll grab three different

36
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,480
areas of colors and it hasn't like from

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,850
light to dark and so it grabbed the red

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,130
from this car and the rims over here it

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,540
grabbed some of the greens and yellows

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,790
from the plants and to grab some of

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,409
these blues and grays from work from

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,420
around to and so if we wanted to apply

43
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,240
this look to another image say maybe

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
this image here we would just have this

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,710
image loaded in and then we go to

46
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,450
acquire as target and what that'll do is

47
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,760
attempt to put these colors over top of

48
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,610
this image so it took just a second to

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,590
do that some processing but now we see

50
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,440
it's using these colors and it's finding

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,619
similar colors that kind of correspond

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,790
and it's applying them so we see it

53
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,650
didn't change the white at all but it

54
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,600
should change the look of this so if we

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,770
disable this we can see how it looks

56
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,720
like before and after oh I guess it did

57
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,219
change the white it darkened some of the

58
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,719
white some of the grays and the whites

59
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,760
were darkened let's look at another

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,040
example and this one I was doing early

61
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,890
I did five targets so let's change it up

62
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,290
again or five clusters so I set up to

63
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,120
five because I kind of want to get the

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Blues the yellows and oranges and then

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,489
some of these dark dark grays and also

66
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,950
some of the light Gray's and so or the

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,629
the shades whatever they are blues

68
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,530
shades of blue

69
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,810
so I'll click acquire as source and

70
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,019
we'll see this source acquired here and

71
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,760
then I'll go to an image that I've done

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,549
of clouds this one here which is for the

73
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,439
most part unaffected let's put it back

74
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,049
down there and so this is just my kind

75
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,810
of more or less raw image and I'll just

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,370
go acquire as target and it'll probably

77
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,079
make it look pretty similar to that

78
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,170
other picture so there we go we've see a

79
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,810
lot more oranges in the skyline a lot

80
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,450
more purpley in the top we don't get as

81
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,430
many as much of that blue we get a lot

82
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,319
more purple just because of what it

83
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,569
interpreted this picture is having but

84
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,280
again we can kind of change that a

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,000
little bit kind of the shadows a little

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,370
bit on there I guess I would say and

87
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,750
then also this color dominance just

88
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,060
makes it kind of like saturation or how

89
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,660
strong the colors are and so we can

90
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,739
leave that up there so that's not too

91
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,139
bad not as good but then again it's a

92
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,819
good starting point for the colors at

93
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,000
least so it looks a lot more interesting

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,410
than it did before at least we have

95
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,090
those colors to work with and then we

96
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,150
can apply modules on top of this to get

97
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,010
the look we want so play around with

98
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,690
that color mapping module it's a good

99
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,489
tool to have and sometimes you'll just

100
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,739
want to it yeah without having to go

101
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,959
through and and grab a certain look of

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,419
an image you can just very quickly you

103
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,849
know copy it acquire it as target and if

104
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,349
nothing else you can kind of analyze and

105
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,329
see what those colors are out helps you

106
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:01,829
break out and be like oh yeah that is

107
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,620
more of a yellow than a green and it can

108
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,120
kind of help you interpret the colors of

109
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,639
an image so a great module and I think

110
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,620
I've gotten to the end of what I can

111
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,690
teach you in darktable you may have even

112
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,879
noticed that there's lots of resources

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,339
you may have encountered already here on

114
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,560
YouTube and all over the internet

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,279
teaching how to use some of these

116
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,750
different modules specifically and

117
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,219
diving deeper than we've gone in this

118
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:25,139
tutorial series but I think I'm going to

119
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,210
go ahead and end this series here if you

120
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,289
any questions or comments leave them

121
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,800
below as I come across new techniques or

122
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,690
interesting new features in darktable

123
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,780
I'll go ahead and add to this series but

124
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,949
for now I think I'm gonna move on to

125
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,870
another video series so thanks for

126
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,370
watching really appreciate you sticking

127
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,810
with this tutorial hopefully you've

128
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,340
learned something and look forward to

129
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,599
