00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,590
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,910
this video we're going to be taking

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,650
these raw images that we got from we

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,719
saturate calm and I'll show you how to

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,089
apply a watermark over top of the image

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,949
you can either apply it directly over

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,839
top like this we can put it our own

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,670
custom on in the bottom corner so I'll

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,900
call you I'll show you a couple

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,089
different ways that you can do that

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,830
we do that in the darkroom it's actually

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,720
a module so let's apply one to this

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,539
image right here we go to darkroom and

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,130
we see I already have it brought in here

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,599
but if you don't have yours it's not

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,520
here in your favorites by default you

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,010
need to go to more modules in the bottom

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,810
right hand corner and then just search

19
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,520
for watermark these are in alphabetical

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,080
order so it'll be down here at the

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,490
bottom and the double use and click

22
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,000
watermark and that will appear and we

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
can click on it up here as an option so

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,530
there's this drop-down when we it's

25
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,290
enabled right now if we click enable it

26
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,260
will show across here this marker is

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,370
darktable

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,770
we can change it to this has bulb which

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,960
is a black square we can change it to

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,060
this promo which shows information about

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,489
dark table and about the camera and lens

32
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,980
this first one dark table also showed

33
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,480
information about the camera and lens

34
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,060
and the metadata from the actual image

35
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,580
has the dark table logo there and then

36
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,130
this last one is this simple text so we

37
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,409
can put in our own text and change the

38
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,350
color and position of it so this is

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,310
probably one we're going to want to do

40
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,420
right now you can play with the other

41
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,530
ones but they're not incredibly

42
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,570
customizable this simple text is the

43
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,740
only one that's built in that's

44
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,110
customizable and then we can also add

45
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,240
our own so a fifth and a sixth and a

46
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,100
seventh we can add our own custom ones

47
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,770
in SVG format and I'll show you how to

48
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,450
do that in just a second here but to

49
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,040
change this text we just click in text

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,900
and we can type in whatever we want

51
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,440
TJ photos and so we can have that there

52
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,170
and then we can change the color of it

53
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,270
so we click here on color and maybe I'll

54
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,450
make this white and go select so now we

55
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,250
can have it really bold and on top there

56
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,810
if we want but we can make it more

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,360
subtle by going to opacity and turning

58
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,740
down that opacity that's kind of the

59
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
transparency or how clear it looks zero

60
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,038
is all the way invisible and 100 is all

61
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,568
the way visible so maybe I'll put it

62
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,480
down here to about like 17% or very very

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
subtle

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,770
there we have it we can change also the

65
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,900
scale the size of this we can scale it

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,650
down we can change the rotation so

67
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,030
people will rotate it and put it like

68
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,850
this and then we can also change the

69
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,560
position of it so right now it's a line

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,390
to the center we could align it to the

71
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,820
right we could line it to the bottom

72
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,530
right corner we could line to the bottom

73
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,570
we'll just keep it Center aligned right

74
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,790
now and then we can subtly do this X&Y

75
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,390
offset to kind of subtly adjust where

76
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,650
it's at within the picture so there we

77
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,690
go we have a nice sort of soft watermark

78
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,550
now across just with some simple text oh

79
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,770
we can also change the font which is a

80
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,060
pretty important one so you might want

81
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,430
to grab a font that's more any installed

82
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,780
fonts you have on your system you can

83
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,090
inst you can put over here alright so

84
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,980
that's the way to do basic text that's

85
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,500
using the built in module to add our own

86
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,660
in here it's a little bit more

87
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,040
complicated first of all we need to

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,780
create it so if you already have a

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,490
watermark then we can just use yours you

90
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,100
just need to put it in SVG format and if

91
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,410
we hover over just hover our mouse over

92
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,750
here the Mizzou min it'll tell us where

93
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,420
to put these so it says SVG watermarks

94
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,730
in your home directory so mine happens

95
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,459
to be home TJ I'm using Linux so this

96
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,570
file system might look a little

97
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,620
different than yours if you're using

98
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,590
Windows and then send the dot config

99
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,020
darktable in a folder called watermarks

100
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,459
or it's also in the USR / share / share

101
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,520
/ dark table / watermarks on Windows I

102
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,110
believe it's either in Program Files or

103
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,700
maybe in your app data I'll try to

104
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,870
include the link in the description this

105
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,550
video of where to put it but what we

106
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,680
need to do is go out of dark table and

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,780
find that directory so I'll minimize

108
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,080
this and first of all I'll just show you

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,330
you can use Inkscape I would recommend

110
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,790
doing so I've done I've created a quick

111
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,410
little logo here using Inkscape it's

112
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,120
just a transparent background so

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,180
anything we draw behind this Oh show you

114
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,670
real quick oh that I had to draw

115
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,590
something hoops anything we draw behind

116
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,590
here it'll show up so we can change the

117
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,900
color and it'll everything is Trant

118
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,548
everything in white is transparent in

119
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,100
this that make sense and so I can't did

120
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,530
a little bit of a gradient on black text

121
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,729
don't know if I'll show up very well or

122
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,300
not but anyway let's export

123
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,009
this we want to save it actually as an

124
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,440
SVG so I'm gonna go to file and I'll go

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,599
to save and then I asked where do you

126
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,860
want to save it well we need to go to

127
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,259
that location that dark table told us if

128
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,780
we hover over this it's in the dot

129
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,639
config dark table watermarks now on

130
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,960
Linux a dot means it's a in a hidden

131
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,990
directory so we can find that if we do

132
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,479
like this tells us all the everything in

133
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,629
this directory well if we do LS - aah

134
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,490
there's a bunch of other files with a

135
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,860
dot in front of them that dot means it's

136
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,569
hidden so it's there we just can't see

137
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,940
it so this dot config is the one that we

138
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,389
want we can also see those files by just

139
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,060
right-clicking in here and going to show

140
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
hidden files again all of these steps

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,889
are specific to most Linux operating

142
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,099
systems not Windows so if you're on

143
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,810
Windows you can ignore all this part and

144
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,310
you'll have to find it to do it another

145
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,889
way so now we have our dot config we'll

146
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,690
go into there we just need to find dark

147
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,090
table so dark table is right here and we

148
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,569
see there is no watermarks folder yet so

149
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,580
we need to create that looks like we

150
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,080
can't create it from within here so we

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,940
need to actually go here another way

152
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,819
so let's what I've done now see I'm in

153
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,830
the dialog for saving so I need to go to

154
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,960
my folders directory or to my file

155
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,319
explorer I need to go to home and then

156
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,669
find that and again same thing

157
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,469
right-click you can go to show hidden

158
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,599
files if you're not seeing those and

159
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,479
then we just need to go to darktable

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,699
and first create the folder to save it

161
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,460
into au dot config I mean first dot

162
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,889
config then darktable and we see the

163
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:03,509
here some configuration stuff for

164
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,110
darktable

165
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,240
we've seen to right-click and go create

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,069
directory and it will have to call it

167
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,159
water marks spelled exactly like that

168
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,349
all lowercase hit enter now that this

169
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,870
folders here and empty we can close out

170
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,979
of this and go back in and save our our

171
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,139
SVG there so we go to save I know this

172
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,000
seems a little complex but oh look it's

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,139
already there now so we're in that

174
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,460
directory and we'll just call it we'll

175
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:37,340
just call it up here TJ custom watermark

176
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,190
with some underscores for spaces and

177
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,300
we'll hit save

178
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,270
so that's saved as an SVG file now we

179
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,970
can we can see that SVG file if we were

180
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,870
to go into here config darktable

181
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,320
watermarks now we see that SVG file and

182
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,120
also it's also seen by darktable now we

183
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,100
don't have to restart darktable we can

184
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,870
just come over here to our drop downs

185
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,070
now and we have a new option

186
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,060
mm-maybe just close the watermark and

187
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,770
open it again

188
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,360
okay maybe go back to light table and go

189
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,210
back into darkroom now it's there okay

190
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,280
so we had to we had to reload dark just

191
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,990
the darkroom not the program but just we

192
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,520
had to get you back in the darkroom and

193
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,470
we show the drop down we can see now we

194
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,460
have another option

195
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,290
TJ custom watermark that wasn't there

196
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,810
before we click on that and that places

197
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,390
the TJ custom watermark with all the

198
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,950
settings that was there before maybe we

199
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,440
just go to reset all the settings and do

200
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,990
that drop down here we go so now we see

201
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,520
this watermark is placed over here

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,830
doesn't look great on this photo we can

203
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,600
align it maybe to the bottom left hand

204
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,390
corner and adjust that offset a little

205
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,660
bit so that it goes right to there and

206
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,910
down to there adjust the scale a little

207
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,090
bit so we'll put it there and then we

208
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,790
might want to do adjust the opacity and

209
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,290
I just kind of made this little

210
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,630
watermark up quick so it doesn't that

211
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,160
black text I probably make that text

212
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,220
white or something but yeah that's how

213
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,590
you do your own custom watermark and now

214
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,120
that I've put it I line it to the bottom

215
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,890
left and done this opacity like this let

216
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,870
me turn it up a little bit if we want to

217
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,420
apply it to every image in here what we

218
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,880
can do is just click on it in the light

219
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,040
table area kind of how we've kind of

220
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,420
done this in the past just not with a

221
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,090
watermark and we go to history stack and

222
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,760
click copy but then under the things to

223
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,370
copy if we uncheck all the changes

224
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,890
except for watermark and hit OK now it's

225
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,560
just copied that watermark with the

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,720
opacity and the location that we put it

227
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,580
now we can click on a couple of these

228
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,070
other ones and we can hold ctrl while we

229
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,230
select all four of them and then we can

230
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,450
go paste and then we can just paste that

231
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,720
watermark on all four of these and now

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,440
we see it yeah I did it we can't see cuz

233
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,940
it's off the screen we can see here

234
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,990
these things are

235
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,790
Haller but they are going to be on there

236
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,440
if we double-click we can probably see

237
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,810
that yeah it's down there so we need to

238
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,010
come in and adjust it just because of

239
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,709
the size of these that we can see that

240
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,110
watermark so that is adding custom

241
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,260
watermarks to images in darktable and we

242
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,000
see that it added to all of those ones

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,620
if we had a hundred pictures we could

244
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,300
add a hundred at once this is a great

245
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,880
way to watermark images if you're you

246
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,709
know gonna be sharing them with clients

247
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:16,820
or if you just want to put a tiny

248
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,130
watermark on with your your website or

249
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,070
something yeah if you have any questions

250
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,480
