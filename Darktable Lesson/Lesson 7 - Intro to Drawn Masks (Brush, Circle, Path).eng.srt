00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,009
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,660
this video we'll learn how to apply

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,629
masks to our images so it's just a basic

4
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:12,240
intro to using masks and what masks lets

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,339
us do is mask out a certain part of the

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,410
image and apply different modules or

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,859
effects to only that part of the image

8
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,420
masks can be very simple shapes or very

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,859
complex and we'll learn how to do those

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,320
in this video I have images here I've

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,720
downloaded from we saturate calm I'm

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
going to use this one for our example

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,199
you can download this and follow along

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,820
I'll include the link in the description

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,260
of this video if you want to follow

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,450
along in this tutorial with this exact

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,940
image so over here to the left we have

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,680
our history and I had a step that I

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,910
applied here that I'll be showing you

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,640
how to recreate basically the only thing

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,470
I've done here is applied the monochrome

22
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,470
module and then I've masked out just

23
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,540
this part a simple circle around the eye

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,820
we can see what that looks like this

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
mask and it's doing a drawn mask right

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,760
here and it's just a circle hope there's

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,590
a second one so we could apply this a

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,450
second time if there were two eyes we

29
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,920
could have the other eye over here but

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,750
we see everything within this circle is

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,090
not being affected and everything

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,040
outside of the circle is being affected

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,020
by this monochrome and that's because we

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,550
have it inverted down here at the bottom

35
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,810
but we're getting ahead of ourselves

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,300
let's just undo this whole thing so

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,400
we'll turn this off and actually we'll

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,170
just come over to this base we'll go

39
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,760
back one step in history and hit

40
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,400
compress history stack so it's as if

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,380
that never happened now and then also

42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,090
under our mask manager I'm just gonna

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,909
right click and go clean up unused

44
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,770
shapes so this is how yours will look

45
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,810
under mask manager you'll have no shapes

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,820
and you'll just be left with this stock

47
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,370
image and monochrome is if we enable it

48
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,440
it just goes over the whole thing so I'm

49
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,270
gonna show you from the very start how I

50
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,520
created that look so what we need to do

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,229
first is draw a mask there's a few ways

52
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,659
to do it what we can do is come over

53
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,880
here to our mask manager this shows us

54
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,740
all the different masks that we create

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,170
and we can jump back to a mask if we

56
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,260
ever want to use it multiple times so

57
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,700
the different ways to draw we can hover

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,409
over and see what options we have here

59
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,110
we have add brush we can add a circle

60
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,008
and ellipse a path or a gradient and so

61
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,049
for this one I did a circle but what the

62
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,530
brushed

63
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,240
it lets us just draw so we can

64
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,370
left-click and everything in black is

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,350
what's going to be affected so we can

66
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,480
kind of draw in a brush but that's not

67
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,980
perfect for the eye it looks like a

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,319
bunch of lines but if we were to apply

69
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,209
this it would give kind of the same

70
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,920
effect it's just not as accurate as we

71
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,670
would want ctrl Z will undo that what I

72
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,310
used was the circle and so if we do the

73
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,959
circle and then we click it creates a

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,630
circle we can use our scroll wheel

75
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,610
inside of the circle to change the size

76
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,430
the scroll wheel on the mouse or we can

77
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,330
scroll well in here between to change

78
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,640
the size of the feather and if we just

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,930
left click and drag we can move it

80
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,310
around so we'll move this to the center

81
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,750
of the eye and then we'll make the

82
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,790
feather kind of go out to here

83
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,410
or maybe we'll click and make this size

84
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,450
go out to here and then the feather will

85
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,530
come in to about there that's probably

86
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,780
good and the feather is just going to be

87
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,200
fade a kind of a fade for the mask so

88
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
it's not just such a harsh hard cut over

89
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,610
from the effect it makes it look more

90
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,910
natural or less obvious that a module is

91
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,310
being applied okay now what we have in

92
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,530
our manager we have two brushes we have

93
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,060
this one that we created and then we

94
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,920
have this one that we created so we can

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,350
use either one that we want and we could

96
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,239
do a third if we want we can click on

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,730
this path and the what the path lets us

98
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,010
do is left-click and every time we click

99
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,010
it creates a node so we can do a much

100
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,200
more advanced shape so I'm just left

101
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,150
clicking around this entire eye right

102
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,450
now and when I'm done I can double click

103
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,970
I was out to do it no what do you do oh

104
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,890
you right click right click to get out

105
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,390
of it so I've kind of messed that up a

106
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,769
little bit we can come in now and and

107
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,470
just left-click these and adjust them

108
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,100
individually to get just the shape we

109
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,510
want and again it has a feather as well

110
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,799
we can hover over in between the the

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,630
actual shape and the dotted line to

112
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,640
adjust the feather or we can click on

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,950
the inside the actual shape and adjust

114
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,540
the size of the whole thing we've drawn

115
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,090
two by just rolling that scroll scroll

116
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,798
wheel in and out we can left-click and

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,228
move the whole shape around too and we

118
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,418
can adjust these individual nodes they

119
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,800
also have a handle on them who want to

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,160
adjust like the bow we can do a little

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,140
adjust the curve and the angle of the

122
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,000
node but that's maybe something we'll do

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,820
more in the next tutorials so all we've

124
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,010
really done is drawn masks we're not

125
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,170
working with any modules right now we

126
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,970
can apply these three masks that we've

127
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,520
drawn to any modules we want so let's

128
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,200
come over to that monochrome one and

129
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,870
let's apply monochrome now so we just

130
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,850
enable it by clicking here and it

131
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,530
applies this monochrome module to the

132
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,370
entire image we've done this sort of in

133
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,050
the past we can move this around and

134
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,670
sort of change the way that that it's

135
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,160
interpreting and and looking at those we

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,870
can adjust this on/off aggressing much

137
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,690
in this particular image but we can

138
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,040
still make all the different settings we

139
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,200
want to change the entire image but if

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,450
we only want this module and its

141
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,910
corresponding settings to apply to

142
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,070
what's inside of our mask we need to go

143
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,320
to this blend under here where it says

144
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,410
blend right now it says off so we drew a

145
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,510
drop down here and it says what do you

146
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,550
want to do uniformly which is what we're

147
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,960
actually doing now we can click on that

148
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,910
uniformly just means it applies it to

149
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,120
the entire image evenly or we can do a

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,770
drawn mask which is what we want to do

151
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,780
because we drew some masks here we'll

152
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,370
cover these other ones later we have

153
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,230
parametric masks and drawn and

154
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,120
parametric masks we'll do those ones

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,830
later but for now just do drawn masks

156
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,320
and then we can we have these same tools

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,170
down here that we can draw a mask we

158
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,420
could do a circle and ellipse a path use

159
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,400
the brush it's the same tools that we

160
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,930
have over here on our mask manager and

161
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,750
if we draw a mask over here if we do

162
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,180
like the ellipse and we draw any lips it

163
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,300
appears over here in our mask manager as

164
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
well so there's multiple tools we have

165
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,810
for drawing them I just want to show you

166
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,120
can draw from the mask manager and so

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
now we see what happened with that

168
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,290
ellipse it applied the monochrome just

169
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,300
where that ellipse was so we can change

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,090
the size of this and anywhere this shape

171
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,840
is at it will be where our effect is

172
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,360
being applied we kind of want that to

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,530
look a little bit different don't we

174
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,330
because we don't we I showed you earlier

175
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,730
it wasn't a black and white eye it was a

176
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,140
colored eye and everything else black

177
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,750
and white to invert the mask we just

178
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,980
click over here

179
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,680
we hover over this little line this

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,030
little icon with a circle with a line

181
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,880
through it is called toggle polarity of

182
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,480
the drama

183
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,240
if we click that then it toggles and so

184
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,670
now is the opposite so now we see the

185
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,650
color and everything else is a black and

186
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,220
white if we want to do we can now if we

187
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,690
click over here right now we're using

188
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,350
the shape called ellipse number four but

189
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,600
we can change to use something different

190
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,310
so we if we look over here under drawn

191
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,320
mask there's a drop down and we could

192
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,900
use this brush number one instead that

193
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,120
we drew earlier which is pretty much the

194
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,100
same effect we could use this circle

195
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,240
which is also going to be pretty much

196
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,790
the same effect or we could use our oh

197
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,230
we want it we don't want to use all

198
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,680
three we want to use one or the other

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,150
we could use our path number three which

200
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,340
is that line out here so we have a set

201
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,350
up to use all all of them right now if

202
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,270
we hover over this we say show and edit

203
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,940
mask elements so that just shows if

204
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,710
there on there being viewed sometimes

205
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,510
especially with this one it gets in the

206
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,490
way so we can toggle to have it be not

207
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,810
shown but it's still being affected I'm

208
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,000
not exactly sure how to remove we've got

209
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,070
a bunch of them on now I'm not sure how

210
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,240
to remove those so I'm gonna do is go to

211
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,190
reset on here and we'll do the same

212
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,510
thing with blend but this time we'll

213
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,610
only select one of them so we'll go back

214
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,240
to drawn mask and we will just use just

215
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,910
one of these masks so let's use just

216
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,650
this circle here and then we'll go to

217
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,630
invert so that's really it and then we

218
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,280
can we could do the same thing if we

219
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,200
didn't want to do monochrome or we could

220
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,940
leave the monochrome on and now we can

221
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,780
grab another one like maybe what should

222
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,140
we do this color contrast if we go to

223
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,970
color contrast now and enable color

224
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,970
contrast if we make changes it's going

225
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,590
well since everything is black and white

226
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,390
this kind of convenient for us but we

227
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,520
can go to our blend mode we can go to

228
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,570
drawn mask and just do again this circle

229
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,690
number two and now the changes that we

230
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,280
make well we can change sort of the

231
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,530
color of that eye we can make it look

232
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,270
like a different color or more extreme

233
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,479
if that circle is bothering us we can

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,979
turn off seeing it but still apply

235
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,200
changes to it and if we ever want to

236
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,730
make changes we can come over here to

237
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,830
our mask manager and click on that

238
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,900
circle number two and then we can make

239
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,320
changes to it we can move

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,530
around we might have to reapply it over

241
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,570
there if we do that though oh no it's

242
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,980
going you just took a second

243
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,200
so it'll then make those changes to

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,130
wherever we move it to on the image we

245
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,500
can even change the size of it we can do

246
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,620
all kinds of stuff so that's basic drawn

247
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,260
masks in the next video we're gonna

248
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,000
let's touch a little bit more on using

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,330
the paths tool to draw our mask and then

250
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,910
also we're going to be looking at

251
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,340
parametric masks as well so go ahead and

252
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,390
play with those if you want to get

253
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,890
something undone we right click we can

254
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,580
go ctrl Z to undo things in darktable

255
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,230
but I think I'm going to leave this

256
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,240
video here and then of course like we've

257
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,260
learned in the past if you want to

258
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,640
export this if we love the way this

259
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,470
looks we can just go to light table

260
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,980
click on the image and go down to our

261
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,140
export selected and click export and

262
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
that will export just the selected image

263
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,120
or any images selected and that goes to

264
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,390
our folder here in where was that image

265
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,920
since that since that was in dest

266
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,500
downloads it's going to be a new folder

267
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,960
called darktable exported and we have

268
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,590
just this exported image and again like

269
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,420
we've talked about before our original

270
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,640
image is still here unaffected one of

271
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,310
these ones so we don't have to worry

272
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,620
about overwriting our image if we ever

273
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,540
want to get back to the original we can

274
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,450
definitely just do that thanks for

275
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,260
watching hopefully found this

276
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,520
informative go ahead and leave your

277
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,840
question in the comments below play with

278
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,140
masking just know that all you'll look

279
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,610
at all these different modules they all

280
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,520
have this blend option so the sky is the

281
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,860
limit on what you can do you can even do

282
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,870
exposure to a specific part of the image

283
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,210
really really powerful stuff play with

284
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,220
drawn first and once you get comfortable

285
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,630
with that we'll move on to parametric

286
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,340
thanks for watching guys - catch you in

287
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,730
the next tutorial
