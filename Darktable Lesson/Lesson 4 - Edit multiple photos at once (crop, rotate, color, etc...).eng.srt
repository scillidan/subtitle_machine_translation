00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,250
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,470
this video I'll show you how to make

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,509
changes to a single image and then apply

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,579
those changes to multiple images at once

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,980
so this is like batch image editing and

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,480
it's a really powerful feature of

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,259
darktable

8
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,640
whether you're working with raw photos

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,429
or any type of picture really so in this

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,140
example I have some edits that have

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,669
already been applied to these leaves

12
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,910
here so they look a lot different than

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,579
the pictures before it but since all of

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,960
these pictures were taken with the same

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
camera with the same lighting at the

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,160
same time roughly we can just take this

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,040
now and go to copy over here so we have

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,160
this history stack we can expand and

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,140
click copy while that image is selected

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,200
and we can copy all the modules to the

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,300
effects that were being applied to it so

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,610
sharpen exposure there's some tone curve

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,170
and color correction that happened to it

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,600
it was cropped in to be lit more of like

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,150
a widescreen aspect ratio so we'll hit

26
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,940
OK to copy all of those and then we can

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,190
select another image and go to paste and

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,319
we can just choose which of those things

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,270
we want to paste and it will paste it on

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,740
then all of a sudden that image looks

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,020
like it as well and we can select by

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,420
holding the control key multiple images

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,820
here and just go over here to paste and

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,250
very quickly we can apply those changes

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,490
to multiple images so this is a quick

36
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,040
way to do that let me just zoom out here

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,659
let's come down to some other pictures

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,610
like these ones of me here and I'm just

39
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,970
going to do it quick so I did this one

40
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,400
here let's double click let's just do

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
some quick edits to show you an example

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,990
of this maybe we want to crop in a

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,460
little bit so we'll do crop and rotate

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,560
we can do that first so we'll do this

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,110
widescreen crop and rotate if we wanted

46
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,820
to change that we can change the aspect

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,100
ratio here to crop to any different type

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,430
of like a standard printed image sizes

49
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,460
or standard image side image sizes for

50
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,590
screens and monitors but let's just do

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,210
this one this is widescreen right here

52
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,860
so I'll double click to set that and

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,869
then we can see if we're curious what's

54
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,400
happening we can always go back to our

55
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
original and see how it looked before

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,260
and the changes were made let's change

57
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,840
this a little bit here too we can find

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,790
something from these more modules and

59
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,379
sometimes I just like to play with these

60
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,130
infants

61
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,050
we just click on them we can see what

62
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,400
some of these ones look like like

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,620
colorize I know is just going to oh

64
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,750
that's not gonna be there ok we'll do

65
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,310
color correction instead so color

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,290
correction we just get to click this dot

67
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,640
here and we drag it in a certain

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,890
direction and whatever cover we drag it

69
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,530
towards is sort of adjust the pixels to

70
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,610
be more color colorized in that color

71
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,460
and it's always referencing to the

72
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,500
center to everything being neutral but

73
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,270
we can move that Center reference to if

74
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,130
we do like a green and the orange type

75
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,960
here it's gonna make it look more like

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,510
an Instagram filter a little bit or we

77
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,250
can have it be more in the blue greens

78
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,970
or some blue purples here but it's good

79
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,590
to have if you keep this black dot in

80
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,960
the middle and then you just subtly move

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
this around you can subtly adjust the

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,160
colors a little bit and we can make that

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,810
look a little bit I don't know how we

84
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,600
wanted to look maybe we'll make it look

85
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,230
like that sure let's go to our color

86
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,870
contrast and see if we can make it a

87
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,820
little adjustment there so this way if

88
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,650
we do the green versus magenta it's

89
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,610
definitely going to take some of that

90
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,400
redness out of my face which I like and

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,350
then we can add in more some more yellow

92
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,170
and blue too or take that out so we can

93
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,240
add in a little bit there it's always

94
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,630
hard

95
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,970
I always make things more exaggerated

96
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,570
and extreme but let's try and take the

97
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,800
redness out so that looks a little bit

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,540
better there and that was under that

99
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,970
color contrast and again a lot of these

100
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,190
I just grab I'll just grab whatever his

101
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,959
have been yet will do that's an easy one

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,420
so the vignette will apply here and this

103
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,570
is just going to be kind of bring those

104
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,790
gray that shadow in the background a

105
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,980
little bit we can adjust this to kind of

106
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,660
fit this picture a little bit more just

107
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,790
kind of draws the focus more on me draws

108
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,050
the focus on your subject a little bit a

109
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,090
little bit more okay so we can do that

110
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,560
we can see from the original it looks

111
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,740
like this you know over here and another

112
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,300
way that we can show the differences

113
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,940
there too if we just go back here let's

114
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,570
just get off of it and yet a little bit

115
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,310
we can go to a snapshot so we come here

116
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,880
to snapshot and we go to original and we

117
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,620
go take snapshot

118
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,090
and what that's going to do is give us

119
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,190
an original here we can click on and now

120
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,290
it's it brings up a line that shows us a

121
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,940
difference between our original and our

122
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,500
edits right now we're clicked on

123
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,780
original but if we go back to so show

124
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,340
our our edit is we can see the

125
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,280
difference we see the crop we see the

126
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,380
colors we see them in getting we see

127
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,850
everything that's going on there and

128
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,070
it's kind of cool and we can also click

129
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,660
in the center of this to rotate it and

130
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,810
we can look at it from top to bottom as

131
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,570
well so that's kind of a cool way I like

132
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,220
to keep this up actually so I can see

133
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,440
what's happened with my original image

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,300
and how my edits have been applied

135
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,530
because sometimes you'll like more

136
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,780
what's happening in the original but in

137
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,190
this case I think it's we've definitely

138
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,430
improved this photo some so let's take

139
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,680
this now and let's apply this to some

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,300
other images so we go back to our light

141
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,220
table and we see this is the one that

142
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,810
we've done edits to this one I did

143
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,880
earlier but if I want to clear the edits

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,860
on this one I can do that also in this

145
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,080
area under history stack I can just

146
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,810
click on discard and hit yes and it

147
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,970
makes it go back to how it was before

148
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,010
but now I can click this image I can go

149
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,860
to copy it brings up this dialog to

150
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,330
select the parts that we want to copy

151
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,220
the different modules I hit OK

152
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,130
and now I can select the image or images

153
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,810
I want to apply them to maybe I'll do it

154
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,960
to these five all around and just go to

155
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,169
paste and go ok and now all those five

156
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,870
have that same sort of look so we've got

157
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,780
the same look on here and now it's a

158
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,849
it's snapshotting relative to the

159
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,370
picture before it so I can just turn off

160
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,410
the snapshot it right there and we can

161
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,240
see what this looks like so a really

162
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,180
really cool feature being able to make

163
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,770
edits once and apply them to multiple

164
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,210
pictures especially if you're working in

165
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,240
like a photo shoot but also you it

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,590
doesn't have to be just photos you could

167
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,229
use this for like web design if you have

168
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,349
a bunch of logos that are all need to be

169
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,360
rotated at once you can really apply

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
this feature it to lots of different

171
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,560
things when working with pictures and

172
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,280
image files

173
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,960
thanks for watching leave your questions

174
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,400
or comments below if you have any and

175
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll catch you in the next video
