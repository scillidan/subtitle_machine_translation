00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,800
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,049
this video we'll look at styles and

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,059
presets and learn how to use those to

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,249
speed up our workflow and make more

5
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:13,559
professional edits in darktable we've

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,669
learned in the past that we can just

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,740
copy the entire history stack from an

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,869
image and apply it to another one that's

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,849
similar to how Styles will work but

10
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,349
instead of having to hold all those

11
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,390
changes in our clipboard and only be

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,990
able to apply one specific history stack

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,839
at a time styles is right down here

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,240
right below the history stack and what

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,970
Styles lets us do is save a certain all

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,430
the changes all the modules and their

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,100
settings we can save that so we'll click

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,840
create and it brings up this box and we

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,410
can just call this cool black and white

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,410
and go to save and now we can apply that

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,260
to images when we're in the darkroom and

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,180
doing our edits so the other way to do

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,440
this is we can just come up here like

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
we've learned in the past and go copy we

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,890
copy all of them and then click on the

26
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,210
image we want to apply them to and go

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,030
paste so this is not styles this is just

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,830
copying the modules with their settings

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,390
and applying them to another image

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,790
whereas style is once we've done this

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,470
once we've created a style and we go

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,600
into the darkroom we can select any

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
image like this one here and then we can

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,130
just come down it's this teeny little

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,159
icon and we click on this and it brings

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,230
up a dialog and says what style are at

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,850
contact of the list and I only have one

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,409
right now this one that I just created

39
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,409
but if we click on it it applies

40
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,610
everything that was on that image which

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,340
is only it actually duplicated some of

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,840
that stuff over there but it basically

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,150
applied all that to the two here let's

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,890
go look at another one so I have one

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,510
that I made some changes to earlier and

46
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,420
this one does have a little bit so I did

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,610
some color correction we have some split

48
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,049
toning and me not covered correction I

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,340
did some monochrome I did some split

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,420
toning a little bit of I put a vignette

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,310
around it so let's just maybe if I want

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,020
to replicate this look or have this be

53
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,030
like a signature look for pictures that

54
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,510
I do

55
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,760
I could come into the light table and

56
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,010
then go to this drop-down here for

57
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,520
styles and I'll just go to create oh I

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,869
want one make sure I'm selected on that

59
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,729
image which I am and click on create and

60
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,800
now I'll call this one TJ cool filter

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,460
and now this click save and now this is

62
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,630
saved here so now I have two different

63
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,150
options so now when I'm in the darkroom

64
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,010
if ever I want to see just very quickly

65
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,020
I wonder what this image here would look

66
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,690
like with my cool filter settings I can

67
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,420
just click this here and go to TJ cool

68
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,150
filter and it adds all of those modules

69
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,330
with all of those settings to them so

70
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,130
that's Styles now that's different from

71
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,400
presets what the presets let us do is if

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,140
we apply something like a vignette for

73
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,120
example we want to apply that to here

74
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,890
there's these three little lines and

75
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,480
we've looked at this a little bit before

76
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,310
actually we click on these lines and we

77
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,990
have some different options so here's

78
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,490
the one that I created called dark VIN

79
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,010
it creates a very strong dark vignette

80
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,500
around the image and there's one that's

81
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,570
built in called Lomo and it just looks

82
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,970
like this not quite as strong but it

83
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,650
adjusts all these different changes but

84
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,840
it's only for this module so it's not

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,970
applying a bunch of different modules to

86
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,260
an image it's just changing the

87
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,790
different input values for this

88
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,250
particular module so if we notice we

89
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,170
come down here to soften there are no

90
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,540
presets and if we click on vignette it's

91
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,610
going to have presets specific to the

92
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,380
Finn yelling we can go to like our tone

93
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,420
curve has some different ones there like

94
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,700
a high contrast we can click on and see

95
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,110
what that looks like these are built in

96
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,590
there's a linear so we can see and then

97
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,269
we can see what they look like do we

98
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:39,220
have a medium contrast which the curve

99
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,810
looks like this and it makes these

100
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,970
changes and if we want to adjust this

101
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,130
and make our own custom one we can do

102
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,410
that as well we just get it to where we

103
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,080
the input to the way that we like it we

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
click on these three lines and go to

105
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,860
store new preset and it comes up with a

106
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,070
dialog so I can call this one extreme

107
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,610
and go okay and now we can apply that to

108
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,590
any image we want we open up a new image

109
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,280
and we go to extreme and we see how that

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,350
adjusts this image and how it makes it

111
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,690
look to delete a preset if we want to

112
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,190
get rid of that extreme we can click on

113
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,089
it and just go to apply it first and

114
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,279
then we just go to delete this preset it

115
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,019
comes up with a dialog we just say yes

116
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,150
and now that preset is no longer there

117
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,190
and that's the same with the Styles

118
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,350
we'll go back into light table we can

119
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,330
delete a style by just clicking on it

120
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,970
and going to delete and then that style

121
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,610
would no longer be available one preset

122
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,350
that we've used in the past that before

123
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,270
we kind of talked about presets are the

124
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,100
presets for the base curve based on

125
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,160
different cameras and so these are put

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,770
in by default and again we can make our

127
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,560
own and save our own custom preset if we

128
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,900
want to and so that's just a great

129
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,940
powerful feature using these presets and

130
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,490
using styles in the next tutorial we'll

131
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,590
learn how to create our own style based

132
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,990
off of an existing image so if we want

133
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,060
to have this sort of look and feel and

134
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,760
apply it to a picture of our own that's

135
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,530
just a picture I downloaded we'll learn

136
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,110
how to take the colors from that using

137
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,840
this color mapping module and so that

138
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,340
should be a lot of fun will take like a

139
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,080
sky picture like this and hopefully be

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,780
able to make it look apply that to a sky

141
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,280
picture that I've taken that's not

142
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,470
nearly as cool thanks for watching go

143
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,310
ahead and leave your questions and

144
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,630
comments below if you have any and we'll

145
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,740
catch you in the next video
