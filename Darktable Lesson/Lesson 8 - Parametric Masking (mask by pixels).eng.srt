00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,049
welcome back to another darktable

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,150
tutorial in our last tutorial we learned

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,700
about masking using drawn masks so we

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,190
drew a mask and we change the size of it

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,990
and the feather and we had applied

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,419
changes our module would only happen

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,279
within that mask well in this video

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,810
we're going to be looking at parametric

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,460
masks which let us do something a little

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,150
bit different

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,539
it lets us choose based on the pixels we

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,730
can choose based on color based on the

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,830
brightness of the pixel or based on some

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,289
other attributes of pixels as well so

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,729
it's really nice in this case we

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,260
wouldn't have to if we didn't have

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,940
parametric masking we'd have to grab our

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,520
paths tool and we'd have to mask off

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,410
every individual thing if we wanted to

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,840
change the sky color for example we have

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,400
two masks here we have two masks here

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,580
here this little part up here so it's

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,440
nice if we can just select all the sky

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,750
based on a common attribute that it has

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,330
like its color or its brightness and

26
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,410
that's exactly what we can do with

27
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,200
parametric masking so oh I want to show

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,910
you one thing though I didn't talk about

29
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,560
last time I don't think if we draw a

30
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,230
mask and then we come over here and we

31
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,850
try to apply that mask with on this

32
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,070
color corrector for example we go to

33
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,150
drawn mask and we say use the circle one

34
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,430
we can see what this mask is doing by

35
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,800
just making it we can make a change on

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,640
the image and we can see how that change

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,159
changes the way our image looks or we

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,720
could also if we don't if our change is

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
very very subtle maybe let's say we're

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,490
only altering the color a teeny tiny bit

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,979
and it's hard to tell what's exactly

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,170
happening in there we can look at our

43
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,790
masks in more detail by clicking this

44
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
little white icon this little white

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,530
square with a circle in it if we click

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,530
that it turns our whole image not

47
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,900
permanently it just for the help of met

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,840
of us masking it turns our image black

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,790
and white and it shows us our mask in

50
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,700
yellow so then we can see if we hover

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,530
over the feather and change the feather

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,000
we can kind of see more what that's

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,030
doing how that's fading out our mask and

54
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,890
so we can kind of see more how our mask

55
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,080
is behaving relative to the image behind

56
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,869
it this is gonna be a really important

57
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,369
thing and really good to use in our

58
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,169
parametric masking that's why I bring

59
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,019
that up I don't know if I talked about

60
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,010
last time either

61
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,470
masks will just click on it and then we

62
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,909
can right-click on it and it'll go away

63
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,269
so now we see our whole image is being

64
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:22,890
masked because we don't have anything

65
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,959
drawn and then when we draw something it

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,000
comes back in there anyway

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,069
let's click this little icon right here

68
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,129
to reset all everything in here our

69
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,620
blend is back to off and now we're going

70
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,930
to click the drop down left click and go

71
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,200
down to parametric mask that gives us

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,129
some more options

73
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,730
oops I made a change just reset that

74
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,109
capacity so we still have this little

75
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,640
button here and I'm gonna click it this

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,680
time so we click this and that's going

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,420
to make it so our whole image is masked

78
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,180
out right now and so now we can adjust

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,319
these channels I'm just gonna show you

80
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,180
what it does if we keep it on this L

81
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,730
it's the brightness Channel and as we

82
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,849
drag this around its we can see certain

83
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,349
parts of our image shine through and

84
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,200
certain parts remain masked so in this

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,090
case it's the darker pixels that are

86
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,769
shining through or coming through and

87
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,420
it's the lighter pixels that are being

88
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,909
masked so that's because we're on this L

89
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,980
there's different channels we can do it

90
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,319
based off of hue so based off of a color

91
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,209
of the pixel L is based off of the

92
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,440
brightness of the pixel there's some

93
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,819
other channels here we'll be looking at

94
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,310
later but let's just adjust these

95
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,410
triangles here this is sort of

96
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,480
brightness see we have dark pixels here

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,849
light pixels here and everything in

98
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,220
between and so we can come in here and

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,620
adjust to select just a certain part and

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,410
if we're curious if we want to find we

101
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,079
can use this little dropper here this

102
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,639
little color picker or this picker tool

103
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,609
and we can click and select an area and

104
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,519
that will draw a line so that's area I

105
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,799
selected right here let's do this one is

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,049
showing right here as a white vertical

107
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,720
line on this bar

108
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,340
there's input and output so we're

109
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,040
selecting based on the input right now

110
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,859
so we're going to want to be on this

111
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,180
one's gonna want to be on the right side

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,040
of this little white vertical line and

113
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
this one's gonna be on the left side of

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,819
that white vertical line and then we can

115
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,849
sort of fine-tune this to capture all

116
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,459
the light the spectrum of light pixels

117
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,639
that are within the sky so I'm doing

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,650
this top triangle now the top triangle

119
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,260
is sort of like our hard edge out of our

120
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,669
shape that we were doing earlier and

121
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,970
this bottom trying

122
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,920
sort of like the soft feathered edge if

123
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
you can think of it that way is sort of

124
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,300
the fade around the pixels so we see

125
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,050
this looks very hard and sharp right now

126
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,480
but as we adjust this bottom triangle it

127
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,570
becomes softer and more of like faded

128
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,820
into the other pixels around it does

129
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,260
that make sense it's kinda hard to see

130
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,870
there anyway so the top white triangle

131
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,080
is hard the bottom one is soft so we'll

132
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,950
put that right there

133
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,250
and that looks pretty good so now we're

134
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,350
still in our what's this thing called if

135
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,540
we hover over it tells us display mask

136
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,210
over color channel mode anyway we're

137
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,070
still on this mode let's click this to

138
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,830
take that off and now any changes we

139
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,080
apply this the one that we use this in

140
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,060
is this color corrector so now the

141
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,370
changes that we apply are going to

142
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,540
happen to our masked area and not to the

143
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,430
leaves not to everything else that's not

144
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,470
masked so we can change the color of the

145
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,740
sky in this case without affecting the

146
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,610
leaves directly or vice versa maybe we

147
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,470
maybe the sky was fine if you want to

148
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,880
invert that we can do it just like we

149
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,280
did before this icons right here this

150
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,750
little circle with the white and black

151
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,390
on it we click that and now our

152
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,610
selection is inverted we can see what

153
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,030
that looks like by clicking on here and

154
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,530
we see this is what's selected and our

155
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,640
sky is now not being selected and so if

156
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,229
we make changes here it's going to

157
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,520
change the way that everything looks

158
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,380
except for the sky kind of remains white

159
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,530
and the same whereas if we weren't doing

160
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,300
parametric masking the white the sky

161
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,600
would have like a pink hue to it this

162
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,340
probably isn't the best the most

163
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,660
dramatic one to module two see the

164
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,830
differences here but we can make subtle

165
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,350
differences and again every module has

166
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,720
just about every module we can do our

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,270
contrast we could mask out we could use

168
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,090
parametric masking on our tone curve we

169
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,430
could do parametric masking on so all

170
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,180
kinds of use cases for this and in the

171
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,500
next video we're gonna kind of solidify

172
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,979
this more by doing drawn and parametric

173
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,229
masking so there's a way we can

174
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,750
sometimes you will have a you'll want to

175
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,910
maybe just like this leaf here will want

176
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,249
to select the the area of this

177
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,169
and then also do parametric masking

178
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,779
either within it or outside of it and so

179
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,489
we can do drawn and parametric masking

180
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:51,569
together using its own mode for that

181
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,319
well I think I'm gonna leave this video

182
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,539
here go ahead and play with that I know

183
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,129
we didn't cover everything in parametric

184
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,589
masking next time we'll do maybe we'll

185
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,349
work with hue which gives us we can

186
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,869
select by a certain hue and we can do

187
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:05,649
both at once

188
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,509
absolute if we double click it resets it

189
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,779
we can do both of these at once so we

190
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,969
can select based on the luma channel and

191
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,399
the hue at once and that kind of gives

192
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,249
us more control over our mask but it

193
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:20,559
gets a little bit more tricky and it's

194
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,089
kind of harder just let pixels that way

195
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,339
as well play with parametric masking

196
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,989
it's gonna be a little bit confusing at

197
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,899
first but at the more you play with it

198
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,629
the more you'll realize situations when

199
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,879
it's good to use the parametric masks in

200
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,169
other situations where it's just going

201
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,639
to be better off using the drawn mask

202
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,979
and sometimes altogether you don't need

203
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,659
to use masking you can use certain nodes

204
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:44,249
like in this case we could have used the

205
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,419
color lookup table would have been a

206
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,489
good one for adjusting certain covers of

207
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,860
this without doing masking at all anyway

208
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,059
thanks for watching leave your questions

209
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,589
or comments below if you have any and

210
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:57,389
we'll catch you in the next video
