00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,620
welcome to another darktable tutorial in

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,330
this video we'll be doing drawn and

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,610
parametric masks together so in past

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,679
tutorials we've learned how to draw just

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,780
a certain shape or a path over an image

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,239
and then apply that module just to that

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,009
portion we've also learned how to do

8
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:19,859
parametric masks where we come over here

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,960
and we under the blend mode we go to

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,210
just parametric masks and then we can

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,119
select based on either a certain hue if

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,369
we do hue we can constrict to just the

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,009
blues in this image we drag this over

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,830
and we just get the blues in this image

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,620
and this happens to be what we're doing

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,490
Oh cover correct

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,820
so our mask would look like this in this

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,220
case and as we fine-tune and adjust this

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,170
we can get it more narrow and just

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,750
select some certain blues but the

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,580
problem with this is we're selecting the

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,770
blues in the car and the Blues on the

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,960
ground but also the Blues in the sky so

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,970
when we apply our adjustment it might

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,310
make our whole image it kind of throws

26
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,830
off what we're trying to do maybe

27
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,019
because whatever this car does also the

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,570
sky would do so in this video we're

29
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,790
going to do a drawn and parametric mask

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,190
and we're not going to do the color

31
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,770
corrector maybe we'll do color contrast

32
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,020
so let me turn off that color corrector

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,170
and under color contrast here I'm going

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,570
to go to the blend mode and we'll do

35
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,570
drawn and parametric masks what this is

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,430
going to let us do is mask off a certain

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,380
area and I'll just choose the vehicle

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,479
and I'll do a path this time so we'll

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,060
select this right here and we'll just

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,040
come over and start clicking so I'll

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,490
click a couple times right in here and I

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,900
should probably get a little bit more

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,120
exact than this but I can always fine

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,110
tune this later as well and then when

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm done I'll right click and then the

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,560
feather I can come and just feather that

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,720
in really really really tight and even

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,700
the whole shape I can kind of bring in

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,860
and I can drag and move it around by

50
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,500
left click and hold so that's not too

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,030
bad and now whatever we do so if we do

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,560
this adjustment now it'll make

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,180
adjustments to only the car and

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,369
everything else is unaffected well this

55
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,959
is the same thing that we've really done

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,540
with our with just a drawn this is

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,180
essentially only a

58
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,730
drawn masks but the nice part is now we

59
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,980
can also select certain elements within

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,900
here so as you see when we make an

61
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,969
adjustment here it's also making an

62
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,569
adjustment within the headlight whoa

63
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,390
here and so we're kind of adjusting

64
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,560
colors in there well what if we just

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,500
want to select the blue I'm sorry we

66
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,269
just want to select the blue in here

67
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,150
we'll use our parametric selection in

68
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,480
addition to our drawn selection so to do

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,549
that we come over here and we see we

70
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,260
have options for a drawn mask but we

71
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,970
also have right below that the options

72
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,489
for parametric masks so we can select

73
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,519
hue now and we want we can grab our

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,169
color picker tool and kind of drag that

75
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,519
in there just to get an indicator of

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,579
where that falls on our input notice is

77
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,159
different on input and output because

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,709
we've made an adjustment there so

79
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,780
because we've made an adjustment already

80
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,659
in here that's affecting where this line

81
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,760
falls that's kind of the difference so a

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,049
lot of times when if you play with this

83
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,379
very first you're gonna not the changes

84
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,970
you make on output an input or gonna be

85
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,709
the same but once you've already made

86
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,659
some changes then your input and output

87
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,400
are going to be different anyway I'll be

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,989
working off at the input we'll just drag

89
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,780
this right here and we'll select and

90
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,939
we'll toggle this view so we can see

91
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,400
what our mask is looking like and so now

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,629
this is what our mash was looking like

93
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,040
before it already looked pretty good

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,409
because it was just everything within

95
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,720
completely yellow within that drawn

96
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,599
shape that we made but now if we adjust

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,699
this a little bit we can sort of get

98
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,829
some definition in there and maybe break

99
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,840
out like the wheels and the windows and

100
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,310
see some of that stuff a little bit

101
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,470
separately so that's what I'll do is

102
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,689
drag this in and try to get this in

103
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,150
again we're on hue so we're we're kind

104
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,579
of trying to narrow in on the hue of

105
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,470
this vehicle and that might be pretty

106
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,750
good there we do get some of that but

107
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,069
some of that's gonna be reflections in

108
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:08,780
the glass anyway so we want to change

109
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,000
make an adjustment to that and then I

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,709
can actually click on my mask let's go

111
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,379
back to my drawn mask so I'll go to it

112
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,209
in my mask manager and I'll just adjust

113
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,560
this a little bit now that we're looking

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,180
at it we're seeing sort of the ground

115
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,310
there is being affected so we can

116
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,860
fine-tune this a little bit better so

117
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,020
that we're not so that we're getting

118
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,950
more it looks

119
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,990
little bit more realistic maybe more

120
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,300
accurate to what we're trying to do okay

121
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,250
let's leave it just like that and now

122
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,230
the changes that we make all we've done

123
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,290
really has just affected our masks we've

124
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,880
created a more accurate mask by

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,860
selecting the object and then using the

126
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,410
parametric to select pixels within that

127
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,920
object common pixels and now we can use

128
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,930
the color correct to make adjustment and

129
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,480
it's only going to make adjustments to

130
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,930
the pixels within that selected area so

131
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,490
this particular one's not giving us too

132
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,940
much of an effect the the color contrast

133
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,890
I should have picked a better one to do

134
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,680
an example but really a lot of times

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,850
when if you're trying to change the

136
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,400
color there's a better way to do this so

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
this would just be making a subtle

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,260
adjustment here anyway and so we can see

139
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,850
what it would look like before and after

140
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,500
sort of the changes that we've made but

141
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,510
if we're trying to do color adjust to

142
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,950
check out the next tutorial we're learn

143
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,200
how to do our color zones and that's how

144
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,670
we can create a look sort of like this

145
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,070
where we can take something that was one

146
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,380
color and change it to another color by

147
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,770
just adjusting colors within the color

148
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,680
zone module anyway hopefully that didn't

149
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,630
make things too much more confusing for

150
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,760
you using drawn and parametric it really

151
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,750
is fairly simple where you just draw a

152
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,460
shape and then apply parametric's width

153
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,220
to anything within that shape or that

154
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,000
mask but knowing when and how to use

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,710
this is kind of the harder part of

156
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,210
making that right judgement call of

157
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,730
using the right tool for the job anyway

158
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,020
leave your questions comments below if

159
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,100
you have any and look forward to

160
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,390
catching you in the next video
