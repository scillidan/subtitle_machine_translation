00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,350
welcome back to another darktable

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,240
tutorial in this video we're going to be

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,519
bringing in some raw photos and editing

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,190
those raw photos and developing them

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,869
improving them so in the last tutorial

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,459
we kind of have these things brought in

7
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:15,570
and I just wanna show you how to kind of

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,090
clean this up a little bit we can go to

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,630
this select box over here and we can go

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,640
select all that I'll select everything

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,939
in here and then what we can do is under

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,560
this selected images we have all kinds

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,300
of options for things we can do to those

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,870
selected images we can like reset

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,460
rotation we can duplicate all of these

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,380
we can copy them if we do duplicate

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,000
they're all duplicated so we have a

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,620
duplicate copy of each one of these and

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,170
now only the only every other one is

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,120
selected and we can go to select all

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,050
again and we can just go to remove and

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,140
that will remove them from darktable I

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,120
believe trash will actually delete them

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,090
from the computer so don't do that one

25
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,680
but anyway so now we have we're back to

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,360
the start here and I want to bring in

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,650
some raw photos I want to show you I

28
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,300
have a couple different ones I have some

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,440
that I shot and I have some that I

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,470
downloaded where the end so here's just

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,140
some that I shot we can just click and I

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,970
think I have it set up right now so that

33
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,280
if I if I click on my raw photo it opens

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,330
it up in darktable

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,640
but you can also right-click and go open

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,159
with on my particular computer and I can

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,020
open it raaah photos with image viewer

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,750
so I can just look at this picture in my

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,340
image viewer your computer may be a

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,200
little bit different on this but these

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,370
are some pictures I took just the other

42
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,229
day and I made sure to shoot them with

43
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,110
my Canon camera in raw mode so they're

44
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,530
this dot cr2 which is a Canon RAW format

45
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,600
and when I opened this one up like we

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,040
learned in the last video it created

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,790
sort of a metadata or a dark table edit

48
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,409
file associated with it

49
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,900
so when we edit this picture now here in

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,790
dark table it's only going to apply

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,290
edits not to the picture directly and

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,000
it's non-destructive editing is what

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,430
that's called so we had this picture

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,049
here we see in the light table we have

55
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,940
just a single picture now and in the

56
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,000
darkroom it brings up brings up the last

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,979
tool we had in use which is this

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,258
vignette I think is that what's going on

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,260
here so yeah and that's under well what

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,069
we can do

61
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,719
before we get ahead of ourselves we can

62
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,420
come over here to see what effects are

63
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,249
being applied to the picture so let's

64
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,749
look at that real quick there's these

65
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,340
different icons we can left-click and

66
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,189
toggle between them this very first one

67
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,060
shows us like a power button icon and so

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,010
this shows us which ones are enabled

69
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,180
there's a tiny little thing right here

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,099
it's kind of hard to see but it shows us

71
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,019
this is this picture is automatically

72
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,209
being sharpened it's automatically

73
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,040
having a base curve applied the

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,980
orientation is automatically on

75
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,269
highlight reconstruction white balance

76
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,189
all of these are on and enabled by

77
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,500
default right now with this picture so

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,329
we can click on white balance we can

79
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,430
change the temperature of this which

80
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,590
will change so now we have a much

81
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,079
brighter more like a yellow warm sky and

82
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,669
then if we want to see what it looks

83
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,680
like with that not applied we can click

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,109
this button here and it will go back to

85
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,639
how it was before anything was applied

86
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,980
so it looks very green right now this is

87
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,900
kind of the more raw how it was taken

88
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,319
and then this is with it applied so you

89
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,010
can apply and D apply or enable and

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,329
disable any of the any of these effects

91
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,189
being applied just by clicking on this

92
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,099
button right here another way that we

93
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,569
can change and see what's happening is

94
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,609
by going over to the history and we can

95
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,220
look at the very original picture so

96
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,389
this is originally what it looked like

97
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:36,599
and then after applying sharpen it looks

98
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,000
like this after applying the orientation

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,349
it looks the same because it wasn't

100
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:42,780
rotated after applying the base curve it

101
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,189
looks a little bit different here so we

102
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,590
can see between this step here and this

103
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,349
step here it's quite a bit different and

104
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,620
then the white balance being applied is

105
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,099
different as well

106
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,009
highlight reconstruction not a lot of

107
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,199
change there and then this a white

108
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,139
balance again is being applied so this

109
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,120
shows us our history stack of all the

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
changes that have gone through here at

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,530
any point if we want to we can go just

112
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,479
to this base curve point and we can

113
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,609
export it right here if we go into the

114
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,000
light table now it appears the same way

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,668
that it does in darkroom I want to bring

116
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:18,988
in some more photos from this photo

117
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,459
shoot so I'll go over here to this

118
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,010
folder under import and I'll just import

119
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,229
the entire directory of all the pictures

120
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,480
shot in this photo shoot

121
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,150
and what that does is it lets us see

122
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,860
everything in here that was shot so I'll

123
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,630
grab like maybe this picture of these

124
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,880
rocks right here because I want to show

125
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,760
you what's applied by default by dark

126
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,830
table we can see that by looking over

127
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,930
here in the history again we can go back

128
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,700
to the original so this is a little bit

129
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,500
process that's still pretty close to raw

130
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,930
but it's still processed if we click on

131
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,240
original we see what the original image

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,540
look like that looks like this is the

133
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,820
raw image it's kind of dull it doesn't

134
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,380
have any sharpening applied doesn't have

135
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,870
the base curve applied and so we can see

136
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,180
what each step would look like and we

137
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,910
see it's enhanced just subtly by default

138
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,590
by dark tables so just be aware if you

139
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,820
want to work from the very very

140
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,380
beginning you'll want to click on this

141
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,820
original and start working from there

142
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,250
but it's a good idea this base curve is

143
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,290
really I don't understand it entirely

144
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,030
but over here we can find the base curve

145
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,790
if we click on the effects that are

146
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,460
enabled we see this base curve is a

147
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,220
cannon base curve and so we can see if

148
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,140
it was shot with an icon we'd be able to

149
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,940
do like this Nikon like and it looks a

150
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,650
little different or if it wasn't like

151
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,300
Panasonic or these different ones but

152
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,790
since my camera was a Canon camera that

153
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,890
actually shot this image and since that

154
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,470
was attached to the metadata of that raw

155
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,780
picture it just automatically applied

156
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,180
this and what it's doing is is giving us

157
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,970
an accurate representation of the

158
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,090
lighting and the colors because it knows

159
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,550
how Canon processes pictures or creates

160
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,580
RAW images how that sensor you know

161
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,400
records light anyway so we want to keep

162
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,050
this the same but if we wanted to change

163
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,150
it we can come over here and adjust it a

164
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,250
little bit and we can make changes and

165
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,740
that'll adjust this if whenever we

166
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,420
change it too much we can click this

167
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,610
little icon here and it sets everything

168
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,130
to default in this case it's the default

169
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,380
curve which is a straight line which

170
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,480
gives us kind of how it looked back in

171
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,580
the original but we can come over here

172
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,390
and again apply the Canon light curve

173
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,550
which gives us a kind of a different

174
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,120
look I want to show you on this too we

175
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,300
can do one thing like this white balance

176
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,920
we can you know change the temperature

177
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,970
like we did before make it a little

178
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,060
warmer make it a little cooler exposure

179
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,560
if you want to find a certain thing

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,289
before

181
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,059
mess too much with temperature we might

182
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,009
want to do exposure so we can find

183
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,839
exposure it's actually one of the ones I

184
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,909
think it's over here yeah so if we click

185
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,219
this circle here exposure is one of the

186
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:53,469
options we have but we can find it from

187
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,749
down below as well and then exposure we

188
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,789
can just adjust if maybe we feel like

189
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,710
parts of this or underexposed or

190
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,529
overexposed we can adjust it accordingly

191
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,809
and we can use this histogram up here as

192
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,639
a reference to see if we're kind of

193
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,129
clipping data so we're clipping a little

194
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,899
bit of data in there and so we can

195
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,319
adjust this to kind of make that fill

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,229
our whole area and then we kind of see

197
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,119
kind of that's more bright and so we

198
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,490
adjust that similar routes this is

199
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,169
probably a good time to point out that

200
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,409
I'm really not a photographer and I'm

201
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,080
not into I'm not really experienced in

202
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,899
color correcting and photo enhancing so

203
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,729
I'm just trying to demonstrate darktable

204
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,759
and show you how to use the effects but

205
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,559
unfortunately I'm gonna be limited in

206
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,240
what I'm actually able to show you from

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,899
an artistic or from a be what I'm saying

208
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,479
right from that standpoint anyway I feel

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,099
like this is a good point to end this

210
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,439
video on I just want to show you down

211
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,610
here at the bottom we touched a little

212
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,680
bit on it but any of these things we

213
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,809
want to add we can click over here and a

214
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,669
star will appear and it will be then

215
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,919
added to our favorites so we have a

216
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,509
couple different things added to our

217
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,219
favorites if there's one that you're

218
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,709
using all the time you might want to

219
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,539
just add it to your favorites and then

220
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,709
quickly you'll have a nice little

221
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,330
workflow it's a little bit daunting at

222
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,669
first but just know that this one shows

223
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,159
you which ones are enabled by default

224
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,589
you can disable them and enable them and

225
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,779
then these other ones just show you ones

226
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,849
that deal more with like color you can

227
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,019
hover over I'm going to tells you this

228
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,300
deals with more of tone this one is your

229
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,860
basic group which is kind of what you

230
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,569
it's a good idea to go through and

231
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,879
adjust these at first and so we're just

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,409
getting started I would say go through

233
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,839
and play with these and just see how it

234
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,969
just your picture and you're gonna find

235
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,068
some things that you like to use and

236
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,589
like to not use anyway I appreciate you

237
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,328
watching check out the next tutorial

238
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,920
we'll be learning about snapshots and

239
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,829
how to look at before and afters and

240
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:49,060
we'll play some more with some different

241
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,279
effects as well catch you in the next

242
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,730
