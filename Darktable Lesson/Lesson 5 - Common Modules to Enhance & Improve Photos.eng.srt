00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,140
welcome back to another darktable

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,210
tutorial in this video we're going to be

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,950
learning about how to use some of the

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,320
more common modules in darktable for

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,049
applying effects and edits to raw images

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,909
this will also work for images that are

7
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,550
not raw images if you don't have some so

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,380
I've downloaded a couple different ones

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,679
here and I got them from we saturate

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,490
dot-com I'll include the link in the

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,289
description this video it's just a free

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,999
website you have to sign up but it's

13
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,189
free and it's not the it's just public

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,009
domain artists photographers sharing

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,080
their images with other people and so

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,940
you click on an image and then you can

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,280
download the raw version in some cases

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,680
not all of them but you can download the

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,450
jpg or the raw version and then you can

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,640
edit that image and so not all of them

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,710
have an option for raw but a lot of them

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,360
do and there's just some pretty cool

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,190
images so here's one that doesn't let

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,230
you download the raw so just make sure

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,000
if you want to get a raw image you can

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,050
do some searches through here and

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,980
there's some really good high-quality

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,430
there are pretty large image sizes too

29
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,890
but anyway that's we saturate com

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,060
and that's where I got these from

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,940
include the links for these also but you

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,650
can see they're different file

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,620
extensions too for raw so any fdn GCR to

34
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,360
ARW so depending on what camera you're

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,220
shooting with it has a different format

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,010
for raw but since darktable is amazing

37
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,750
it can interpret all of those and it

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,100
knows how to read all types of RAW files

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,290
so what we can do is we can either drag

40
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,780
and drop these in we can select them all

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,000
and drag all of them in or we can just

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,790
go over here under import and go to

43
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,760
folder and just import the entire folder

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,729
so I'll just go select that folder and

45
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,000
go to open and now they're all imported

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,830
in here into darktable

47
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,840
let's apply some modules and do some

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,490
edits to this picture here I'm going to

49
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,470
double click on it to bring it into the

50
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,510
darkroom and we can quickly jump between

51
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,250
any of those ones if we look here across

52
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,780
the bottom we can double click and

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,909
quickly jump into any of the ones that

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,860
are in our light table without actually

55
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,200
having to go into light table to grab

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,869
them and so when we're in darkroom we

57
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,640
can do that we can just double click but

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,409
let's do this one here just because the

59
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,359
rest of these are already so perfect and

60
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,269
they look so great already that I'll

61
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:13,950
probably do is end up

62
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,319
making them look worse so this one we

63
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,580
can that we can do some improvements on

64
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,190
so we see that it's sort of dark this

65
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,510
looks like one maybe you just like take

66
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,040
on your phone we can see what this was

67
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,420
taken on by clicking the image

68
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,700
information so this was taken with a

69
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,569
Sony camera but a lot of times pictures

70
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,860
you'll just take quickly you're gonna

71
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,019
look like this it's not exposed very

72
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,879
well the sky is really bright and so

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,680
everything else is really dark we want

74
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,120
to try and bring out some of the detail

75
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,730
again I'm not really experienced in

76
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,620
doing this type of color correction but

77
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,819
I just want to get to show you some of

78
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,040
the modules that I think are good to

79
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,959
start with there's a lot of different

80
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,090
directions we could take this but we see

81
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,650
what's happened already we have the

82
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,269
original we have some sharpening that's

83
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,129
happened and then this base curve has

84
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,319
been applied and so the base curve we

85
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,480
could get in and adjust but I wouldn't

86
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,790
recommend it unless it looks really bad

87
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,569
so bad would be like let's just reset

88
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,000
this to default so if it hasn't the

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,349
default base curve it might look really

90
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,480
dark like this we could click and make

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,099
our own base curve and see if we can

92
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,049
make this look a little bit better which

93
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,609
maybe we can look at that just by doing

94
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:22,359
this we can make it look caning that

95
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,500
looks not too bad

96
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,230
you know if we want to see what it would

97
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,750
look like well what should we do maybe

98
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,829
we'll just leave this well let's leave

99
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,260
this base curve right here okay so we've

100
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,150
got our base curve adjusted or we could

101
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,650
use the one that it had which was this

102
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,290
sony alpha like but it looks like this

103
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,940
particular image it's sometimes it's

104
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,819
better to to adjust the curve a little

105
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,560
differently than it had so let's go back

106
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,690
to that base curve we had because we

107
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,340
were rocking it so this is our own

108
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,870
little base curve that we created and

109
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,470
now let's go to sometimes I like to do

110
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,750
you've probably seen I do exposure a lot

111
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,480
so let's go to the exposure and it's

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,919
good just to look at this histogram up

113
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,900
here this is just telling us to the far

114
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,049
left is black pixels to the far right is

115
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,290
white pixels so and this this is all of

116
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,358
our data this is kind of a chart of all

117
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,930
of the pixels in our in our image from

118
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,510
left to right we see a dip in the middle

119
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,390
here and that's because like this dark

120
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,550
area is everything here that was

121
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,220
really kind of darker and this light

122
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,409
area is all the sky and this middle is

123
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,789
going to be stuff that's sort of it by

124
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,979
gray is kind of in the middle so it's

125
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,240
not really having to do much with color

126
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,370
although the color is overlaid behind

127
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,530
you can see but really this is going to

128
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,440
be a chart of our light and dark pixels

129
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,990
in the in the image we don't want the

130
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,150
this data to ever go off to the left or

131
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,800
to the right and that's what exposure

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,690
adjusts is the left and right of this

133
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,240
histogram so we can see if we if dragged

134
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,699
this we can squeeze it all up tight and

135
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,150
so everything is gonna be starting at

136
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,000
medium gray and going towards bright

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,110
that's why everything looks kind of

138
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,659
weird and if we drag this back or the

139
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,840
other direction we're stretching it off

140
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,120
so half our chart is now over here and

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,009
we can't even see it so everything that

142
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,259
was there all that detail is now just

143
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,889
black we don't want that either but it's

144
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,840
a good idea let's go back to this button

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,460
here will let us reset it to how it was

146
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,469
so there's a little bit you can see in

147
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,900
here if i zoom in way close there's a

148
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,940
little bit of space in there where

149
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,029
there's this white area and then there's

150
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,360
off-the-chart so the chart has some

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,190
space that could go we're gonna drag

152
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,289
this and you can even use the mouse the

153
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,449
scroll wheel to get a really fine and

154
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,969
tune that so we're gonna drag this right

155
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,610
here so that it's about just starting

156
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,800
off of there then the other side we're

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,180
gonna do the same thing we're gonna drag

158
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,169
this just so that the the detail is

159
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,000
right to the bottom there that's what I

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
like to do with exposure is fill this

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,990
all in without clipping any of it the

162
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,750
detail we can check this little button

163
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,440
down here if we click this this is our

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,599
under an overexposed indicator so we

165
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,699
just see parts of the sky is overexposed

166
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,009
and anything that would be in blue would

167
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,729
be really underexposed areas and

168
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,560
anything that is in red would be

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,979
overexposed areas so that's okay right

170
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,440
there right I mean we could if we want

171
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,120
to really keep that detail we kind of

172
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,250
have no blue and no red showing but I

173
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,719
think I'll leave that right there we'll

174
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,150
toggle this off

175
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,589
so that's exposure a little bit playing

176
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,210
with that is a good first thing to do

177
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,250
with your image then also levels is

178
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,630
going to be a good thing too and levels

179
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:40,990
is over

180
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,060
here in the tone group so we click on

181
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,860
this and again if we hover over it tells

182
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,930
us what these groups are so we were in

183
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,090
the basic group now let's go to we did

184
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,010
exposure now let's go to tone group and

185
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,910
let's change the levels a little bit

186
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,500
since we played with exposure we don't

187
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,540
want to start adjust this endpoint at

188
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,580
out point this is kind of the same thing

189
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,510
black over here white over here and then

190
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,940
the middle adjusts how the Grays are not

191
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,660
necessarily the greys

192
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,270
but the mids mids are displayed because

193
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,060
it's it's kind of weird with color and I

194
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,590
don't even understand it exactly but

195
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,810
this is adjusting all the kind of the

196
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,450
mid-tones so we can drag this and sort

197
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,130
of bring out some more color here and

198
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,020
it's sort of shifting the way this chart

199
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,330
looks but then we can come in and adjust

200
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,720
that a little bit now we've kind of lost

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,070
some detail in the sky it looks like

202
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,400
though but that's okay because really we

203
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,020
can adjust that in a little bit here so

204
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,270
I want to see the detail here which

205
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,590
we've actually made a big difference

206
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,960
already to how it was before this that

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,890
was before this is how it looks now and

208
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,150
again we've talked in the last video

209
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,380
real quick but let's just do this for

210
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,690
fun we can create a snapshot so if we go

211
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,060
to our original and we expand this

212
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,850
snapshot over here this is one that I

213
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,040
took earlier we can we don't want that

214
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
to be there we'll just click this to get

215
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,850
rid of it click take snapshot will

216
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,310
always take a snapshot of whatever your

217
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,650
image looks like currently in the dark

218
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,680
room and then now we have the snapshot

219
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,570
let's go back and start editing and we

220
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,430
can enable this by clicking on it let's

221
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,000
click on it and now we can see here we

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,770
can see what our changes look like so

223
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,130
this is before and this is after so

224
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,510
really cool that's looking good we'll

225
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,740
just keep it off to the left hand side

226
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,270
right now while we're making changes and

227
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,040
whenever we want we can just drag and

228
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,560
kind of overlay and see how it's looking

229
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,750
ok and we can do it from before too we

230
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,250
could take a snapshot at the exposure

231
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,590
level take snapshot and then we can go

232
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,049
to that one and then we conceded the

233
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,900
difference how it looked just at that

234
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,780
exposure level that make sense so this

235
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,540
is the difference between 5 & 6 between

236
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,790
these two different edits between

237
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,890
exposure and the levels changes we made

238
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,080
so then we can see just what exactly did

239
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,580
the levels do did it improve

240
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,230
or did it hurt the quality of our image

241
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,420
and we see it's a little bit lighter up

242
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,790
there like on the roof and stuff anyway

243
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,960
let's put this over here let's turn that

244
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,470
off for now and let's try to let's look

245
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,800
at one more thing that's good to do just

246
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,520
for like photos in general so white

247
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,930
balance is something good we can adjust

248
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,570
the temperature temperatures usually in

249
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,460
these like thousands of K if you ever

250
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,830
look on like an LED light bulb or like

251
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,510
just different things like the Sun has a

252
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,150
certain light temperature and like the

253
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,710
moon has a certain light temperature so

254
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,180
suppose this was taken in the moonlight

255
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,520
it might look more like this with a

256
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,770
lower temperature it looked more like

257
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,710
you have a lot more blue and the colors

258
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,090
would look differently because the light

259
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,010
source is different so this temperature

260
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,720
kind of adjusts the with the light

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,900
source so we want to we'll probably want

262
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,490
to match a certain way but if we have it

263
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,720
go up higher see it it was at around

264
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,150
5,000 was it oh no one do that let's

265
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,890
leave this on I think we can reset to

266
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,960
default how it was so it was down here

267
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,060
at 5,000 so maybe let's turn it up to

268
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,150
about 6,000 that was kind of cool and

269
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,890
have it more of a yellow look so all the

270
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,020
Reds and the blues everything kinda has

271
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,350
is as if it has a more like a evening

272
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,200
sunset on it so we'll leave that and we

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,030
could adjust colors individually if our

274
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,100
white balance was off the way to check

275
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,690
that if you hit click your middle

276
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,090
control wheel you can zoom in and see

277
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,510
this

278
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,040
so our whites are looking like they're

279
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
being displayed pretty accurate I think

280
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,930
I know it's hard to tell but it's easy

281
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,130
to tell if you haven't really off

282
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,800
sometimes you'll have like a lot of

283
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,760
they'll look like this or something

284
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,410
you'll have too much of a certain cover

285
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,120
too much red or too much green in your

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
whites so you would adjust that by just

287
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,940
coming down and adjusting the this green

288
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,430
slider here let's reset that to how it

289
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,150
was is put the temperature back to 7006

290
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,810
thousand all right

291
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,980
there we go and now since we made a

292
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,750
bunch of changes over here we see if

293
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,280
ever we have to like we have a base

294
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,950
curve happening twice we can get rid of

295
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,770
that and kind of undo but we can

296
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,870
compress those into the same thing by

297
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,150
clicking this compress history stack and

298
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,499
now those

299
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,029
changes in the bass curve a bit and then

300
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,609
combined so look we're losing some

301
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,169
detail in our sky but what I think I

302
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:16,689
want to do with this we're gonna imply a

303
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,209
vignette anyway and I'm going to change

304
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,189
the sky before I do that let's see if we

305
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:24,069
can change the color of the sky so to do

306
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,779
that there's a couple different things

307
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,699
we could do we've done we've looked a

308
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,259
little bit at this in this color

309
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,789
so this is our color group we can do a

310
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:35,619
color correction where we just change

311
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,749
the color of everything in the picture

312
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,509
in general this sort of has a little bit

313
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:42,009
of the same effect we were seeing with

314
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,599
the cover temperature that we just did

315
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,059
but here we're gonna adjust the color of

316
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,579
the sky but at the expense of also

317
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:50,589
adjusting the color of all the pixels

318
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,539
like look at the colors of the ground is

319
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,089
changing too so if we want to adjust the

320
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,339
sky without affecting this down here we

321
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,409
don't want to use the color corrector so

322
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,359
I'm gonna reset that to default what we

323
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:04,119
want to use is this color lookup table

324
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:08,049
it's down here under more modules so

325
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,629
this is a good one to do where's that

326
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,949
adds I don't know if you do this on

327
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,869
every photo I passed it cover lookup

328
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,149
table a color lookup table is going to

329
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,359
let us choose a certain color you can

330
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,979
also do this by brightness which might

331
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,899
make more sense in this case but let's

332
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,099
choose a certain color like what's

333
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,809
happening in the sky there so it's

334
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,259
probably like these this gray will play

335
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,669
more with this in the in other videos

336
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,089
but for the time being we select a color

337
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,669
like the all of the this these this

338
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,739
color right now and then we can adjust

339
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,749
just that color without affecting

340
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,249
everything else but I want to make sure

341
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:43,899
this has some more Browns in it so I

342
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,220
don't think it'll affect the ground too

343
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,099
much so look we can change this we can

344
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,069
add some more make it look more like

345
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,409
blue and purple in the sky without

346
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,889
affecting everything else here so that's

347
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,119
kind of cool and then we can see the

348
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,129
clouds a little bit more in there we can

349
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,319
adjust the lightness or darkness of it

350
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:04,209
so we can really make that sky look

351
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,239
really cool without changing everything

352
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,069
else we're not we're not applying a

353
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,499
color layer over top of everything we're

354
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,049
just adjusting colors within this sort

355
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:17,109
of white gray range this will make more

356
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:18,249
sense as we play with it more in the

357
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,349
future but that looks pretty cool right

358
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,329
so if we turn this off we

359
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:25,029
before really kind of flat and the sky

360
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,279
just makes everything look I know that

361
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,170
blue sky that's actually too much now

362
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,809
that I now that I really look at it

363
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,029
so we maybe adjust the we can adjust the

364
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,549
saturation here so it's not quite so

365
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,920
intense but we can still give it that

366
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,660
sort of a different look than the

367
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,429
original photo had and maybe we'll just

368
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,319
let's apply our vignette and just stop

369
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,480
right there we could bring out some more

370
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,959
detail well let's do one more just so we

371
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,489
can get a little bit experience with it

372
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:57,519
we can adjust the under here under the

373
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,279
basic under the base or these basic

374
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,670
group we can go to shadows and

375
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,069
highlights so these are always good to

376
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,980
adjust to or a lot of times it can be to

377
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,839
our advantage if ever there's some dark

378
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,489
parts like here that we want to bring

379
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,679
out or some of these shadows we can

380
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,749
adjust just the shadows here and just

381
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,069
for fun let's suggest and see how that

382
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:20,529
changes the look and feel of this image

383
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,410
so we can sort of bring brighten up sort

384
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,519
of what's happening down here we don't

385
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,439
want to do too much so it wasn't so bad

386
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,689
and the highlights is gonna adjust some

387
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:31,569
of these highlight pixels too so we can

388
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,209
kind of give more detail into the sky

389
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,529
there and really see those clouds a lot

390
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,549
but I don't know and then if we don't

391
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,019
want if we do it the other direction it

392
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:45,639
kind of makes it like a glow maybe we

393
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,350
will adjust that and keep those in there

394
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,059
a little bit that kind of looked cool

395
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,399
with that detail so that's one two

396
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,749
that's that can be a lot of fun to play

397
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,879
with the shadow and highlights and a lot

398
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,679
of pictures can benefit from this module

399
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,259
as what as well let's apply one more

400
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,610
module because this video is starting to

401
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,169
get kind of long I'm gonna do the

402
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,819
vignette which is going to be this very

403
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,669
last one we have option for this

404
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:10,689
vignette

405
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,119
so the vignette what it lets us do it

406
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,249
just puts draws a circle here there's

407
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,619
actually a outside circle as well we can

408
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,449
click on this little circle and move it

409
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,179
around and change the shape of it and if

410
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,919
you hold your control wheel and scroll

411
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,079
well out you can zoom out so you can see

412
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,509
what's happening here what we want to do

413
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,179
is wrap is put this around our

414
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,020
our subject or our focal point of the

415
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,240
image so we're gonna put this right here

416
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,700
we can move it by left-clicking and move

417
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,790
where it's at and we see this outer

418
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,730
circle is feathering a dark sort of a

419
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,980
dark area see the corners now are sort

420
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,140
of shadowy and dark whereas the center

421
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,180
is bright so it's just applying sort of

422
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,790
a mask overlay to make everything look a

423
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,850
little bit more kind of draw your

424
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,510
attention to the center of this and so

425
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,550
let's do that maybe right like that and

426
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,810
it depends on how extreme we want it

427
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,250
that's a little too extreme I think and

428
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,340
let's make this more oval like my

429
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,630
computer's going kind of slow for some

430
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,860
reason right now I'm not sure what's

431
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,370
happening that's maybe that's okay yeah

432
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,040
so that's that's great there so now we

433
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,340
can um let's come over here and hit and

434
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,160
click on our compress history stack get

435
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,690
all that history there and let's just do

436
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,190
a quick walk through and see what what

437
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,160
all we've done I'm just a click on this

438
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,110
what happened did it did I get rid of

439
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,240
that oh I click on original okay so

440
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,380
we're gonna see what we've done here I'm

441
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,120
gonna hold down the control wheel zoom

442
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,250
this in so this is our original raw

443
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,640
picture that we downloaded we did a

444
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
little bit of sharpening we didn't do

445
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,790
this this automatically happened the

446
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,850
orientation was unaffected and the base

447
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,440
curve we did play with us a little bit

448
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,730
remember so we made it look like this

449
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,740
with our base curve then we use the

450
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,170
exposure a module and we adjusted the

451
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,359
exposure a little bit then we adjusted

452
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,400
the levels which is kind of a gonna gave

453
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,439
it some more contrast between the light

454
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,930
pixels and the dark pixels then we

455
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,520
applied a white balance and in white

456
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,109
balance what we did was the temperature

457
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,329
so we adjusted the temperature to make

458
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,099
it look a little bit more warm that's

459
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,470
the only thing we adjusted there then we

460
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,750
did I don't think we we clicked on color

461
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,980
correction but we didn't really do

462
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,530
anything so it's we didn't really use

463
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,820
that one but it's still in our history

464
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,380
stack because we made changes and then

465
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,590
set it back to no changes we did this

466
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,930
color lookup table which is how we added

467
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,880
some more blue color to the sky that

468
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,130
really wasn't there originally but we

469
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,000
added in just for some effect and then

470
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,410
we adjusted shadows and highlights which

471
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,420
we probably could have done earlier on

472
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,960
in our

473
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,429
stack but we adjusted the shadows and

474
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,320
highlights to kind of gotta bring more

475
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,330
attention to some of the detail in here

476
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,370
I guess and then we applied a vignette

477
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,860
to make us focus make the viewer focus

478
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,570
more on what's happening here

479
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,169
and so let's grab a snapshot of this

480
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,899
final one and then look back here enable

481
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,789
the final one and we can see our before

482
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,919
and after this time before is on this

483
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,120
side and after is here so that's pretty

484
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,690
cool right pretty cool stuff

485
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,370
as a final thing so what you're gonna

486
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,970
want to do is export this so what let's

487
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,039
because I did it reverse way we're

488
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,010
clicking on our original now so if we go

489
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,809
back into light table it's going to look

490
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,539
like there's no changes made to it so we

491
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,460
need to go into darkroom and click on

492
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,230
the highest level of our history stacked

493
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,960
if we want to export it like this and

494
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,940
then go to a back to our light table now

495
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,950
we're seeing it with the changes so this

496
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,179
looks like the way we want it to look

497
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,000
and so to export this because it's not

498
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,380
going to look like that on our computer

499
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,539
if we go back and find the raw file it's

500
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,799
gonna be unchanged and just how it was

501
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,830
before anyway we have to export this so

502
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,840
we can't just go to save there's no file

503
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,179
save on the menu bar or anything what we

504
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,260
have to do is go to export selected and

505
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,610
then since this is a selected image

506
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,460
there's only one we just click on export

507
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,289
don't worry about changing anything in

508
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,450
here for now and it's going to export it

509
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,549
to a folder called darktable

510
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,399
exported in the same directory as our

511
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,340
source image and our source image again

512
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,950
is unaffected we didn't change our

513
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,899
source image at all instead we just

514
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,840
exported it to this folder which is

515
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,600
right here it created a new folder

516
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
called darktable exporter that wasn't

517
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,029
there before with our final image right

518
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:42,539
here so that's kind of a workflow I kind

519
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,649
of wanted to demonstrate some of those

520
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,659
modules that you'll probably use when

521
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,159
working with a lot of things except

522
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,200
maybe not so much the color lookup but a

523
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,610
lot of the rest of those are ones that

524
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,559
you'll use all the time in in darktable

525
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,570
so hopefully that kind of gave you a

526
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,070
little bit more confidence using some of

527
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,110
those there is no right and wrong way

528
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,340
just get in here and play

529
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,540
well there's probably some wrong ways

530
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,970
but there's no right ways so just go

531
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,950
ahead and just get in and play and see

532
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,200
what different things do what are we and

533
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,520
this is the vignette we could have

534
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,080
adjusted some different things on the

535
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,720
vignette and change that a little bit we

536
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
could have added a crop and you know

537
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,380
cropped in here so there's all kinds of

538
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,730
different things look here's a bloom

539
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,740
what does bloom do what does sharpen do

540
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,630
