00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,500
welcome to this darktable tutorial

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,390
series darktable is a great program for

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,920
managing and editing your photos

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,289
including your raw photos if you're a

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,209
photographer this is a must-have program

6
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:14,309
darktable is very similar to Adobe

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,710
Lightroom just as professional just as

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,869
powerful only not just as expensive

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,480
because darktable is 100% free and open

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,009
source if you don't already have

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,900
darktable you can download it for free

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,759
for windows linux and mac check out my

13
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,080
other videos where i show how to do that

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,849
but in this video we're going to be

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,829
exploring the interface of darktable

16
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,360
and we're going to be bringing in some

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,980
pictures and showing you just what it

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,380
can do and how to get started with the

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,380
very basics so to bring in a picture the

20
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,970
easiest way is to find it on your

21
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,310
computer so we can go to like pictures

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,290
here we can find a picture and we can

23
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,570
just drag and drop that picture in and

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,300
then we see it appears here we're in the

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,240
luck the light table right now we can

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,740
drag in a few different pictures just

27
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,930
like this and every time we drag it in

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,060
you notice a file is being created for

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,370
that picture so as we drag it in we'll

30
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,290
drag in this one here and then a file

31
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,850
gets create to the side of it this is an

32
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,290
XMP file created by darktable this has

33
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,090
all the information about the picture

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,440
all the changes that we've made

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,050
which means our picture never gets

36
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,210
changed this picture that we that we

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,010
bring in will never be edited or

38
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,430
modified or changed at all directly

39
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,440
instead all the changes are kept in a

40
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,810
record next to that picture and then

41
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,000
when we go to export the picture it

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,370
applies those changes so this is sort of

43
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,380
similar you can think of the the light

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,780
table as like a traditional light table

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,250
for a photographer that's working with

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,440
film you bring in the different pictures

47
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,510
that you want to work with you look at

48
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,729
them on the light table then you take

49
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,490
them into the darkroom to edit them and

50
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,280
apply some changes but when you develop

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,650
your final picture you still always keep

52
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,620
your original negative intact unchanged

53
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,409
and the changes are only applied to the

54
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,900
new picture you've created this will

55
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,180
make more sense as we dive in and do

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,159
more of this in the future I just wanna

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,990
show you another quick way we can bring

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,209
in pictures is in the import tab we can

59
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,340
just click image and import a single

60
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,440
image by itself and go to open

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
and just bring in a single image and

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,460
then we go to the light table and we

63
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,440
still see them there we can also bring

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,090
in the entire folder which is more

65
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,890
practical for most of the time just

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,930
click on under import click on folder

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,030
and then go to the folder that you want

68
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,480
to bring in and click open and then it

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,270
brings in every picture in that folder

70
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,000
and it also creates on our computer

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,450
it'll create that XMP file next to each

72
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,700
one of those pictures for us it's just

73
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,050
important that you don't delete this

74
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,520
it's sometimes when you're first using

75
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
darktable you see this and you think

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,270
that's weird why do I have that so if

77
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,310
you just send if you make an edit to a

78
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,990
picture and then just send someone the

79
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,940
original picture it won't have any of

80
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,070
your edits or changes to it just be

81
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,980
aware of that okay in the light table

82
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,740
area we can make changes to the to the

83
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,930
metadata of the pictures if we hover

84
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,870
over a picture we see these these stars

85
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,630
appear by default everything has one

86
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,900
star a one star rating and when I was

87
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
first using this I thought well what's

88
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,780
the point why would you give him stars

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,209
like who no one's ever gonna look at the

90
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,459
star rating of the picture but what is

91
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,500
used for is to help you organize your

92
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,420
pictures if you go out and do a photo

93
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,950
shoot you're gonna have some pictures

94
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,180
that aren't that great and you're gonna

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,470
have some that you just really really

96
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,870
like so you give them a star rating and

97
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,790
then you can come over here at the top

98
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,010
and there's this sort to buy you can

99
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,080
drop a select this drop-down you can say

100
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,690
sort by rating then all of your

101
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,400
five-star pictures will appear appear

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,709
first followed by four stars and three

103
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,450
stars all the way down to your one star

104
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,940
pictures again one star is sort of the

105
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,950
default you can also give the pictures

106
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,620
color tags down here at the bottom if

107
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,820
you just click on one of these colors

108
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,739
now this has a little red dot on it and

109
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,810
so these colors and you can give them

110
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,459
multiple you can give it a red a blue a

111
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,769
purple maybe you find a picture and you

112
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,840
say oh the every picture that has this

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,610
person in it I'm going to give it a

114
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,070
green tag so you find all the pictures

115
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,690
that have that person give them a green

116
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,150
tag and you can also select multiple at

117
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,430
once in this area so you can click and

118
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,560
hold down the ctrl key and click

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,870
multiple pictures and then you can tag

120
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,289
all three of them with that green dot

121
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,240
then when we go to sort by instead of

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,820
rating we can sort by color label and it

123
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,890
shows all of our green colors first and

124
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,900
then followed by other colors as well

125
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,660
and then the non color labeled ones so

126
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,790
this is just a way to really manage your

127
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,560
pictures and figure out what's going on

128
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,260
before you bring them into the darkroom

129
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,880
again if you're just working with one

130
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,290
picture you're not going to want to

131
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,790
spend much time in the light table but

132
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,850
if you're working with multiple pictures

133
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,620
particularly like a photo shoot this can

134
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,590
be to a big advantage for you also the

135
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,780
light table area is where we'll export

136
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,670
our picture when we're done editing so

137
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,810
we'll have to come back here to do our

138
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,270
exports let's hop over to the darkroom

139
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,740
now and take a look at the options there

140
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,630
when we click on darkroom in the top

141
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,970
right first of all you can't select

142
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,590
darkroom unless you have a picture

143
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,240
selected so if no pictures are brought

144
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,070
in you can't even get into the darkroom

145
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,770
but if you select a picture and it

146
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,540
becomes like a little bit lighter gray

147
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,090
then you can click on darkroom and it

148
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,920
will take you into darkroom with that

149
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,070
picture this particular one is a not

150
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,920
color which a lot of the feet the tools

151
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,260
in darktable are going to be color based

152
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,940
so we can't do much with this one but we

153
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,910
can do for example this exposure we can

154
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,830
still adjust the exposure so we'll

155
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,500
enable this one and then we can adjust

156
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,020
the exposure of this image and we can

157
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,390
see we can make it very very exposed or

158
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,180
we can make it very underexposed maybe

159
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,710
we'll just make this one really under

160
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,680
exposed and then we'll go to our crop

161
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,050
and rotate and we can apply a crop so

162
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,270
right now it's doing I have it set to an

163
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,520
eight by ten we can do freehand and just

164
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,490
select an area that we want to crop out

165
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,230
so we can just zoom in really close to

166
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,900
like one person and really kind of crop

167
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,230
in just how we want or we can come over

168
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,090
and instead of freehand we can select

169
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,310
like this 8 by 10 and we can say we want

170
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,440
to 8 by 10 picture and then it will say

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,660
all right no problem however you scale

172
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,840
this box it'll always be formatted in an

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,600
8 by 10 aspect ratio so we can do it

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,670
like this and the sides will be cut off

175
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,890
here but we just double click and now

176
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,990
we've kind of cropped this picture we

177
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,880
adjusted the exposure a little bit and

178
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,610
so let's go back to that exposure and

179
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,110
let's make it very extremely so I want

180
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
to show you if we make it really really

181
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,730
overexposed now when we go back into our

182
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,180
light table

183
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,740
that picture looks different than the

184
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,410
rest of them if we want to export it

185
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,020
with this super overexposed we just go

186
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,710
to the export so we select it we go to

187
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,820
selected images or no - well it's

188
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,190
selected we go to export selected and we

189
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,919
just click the export button and that

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,229
exports that picture as a jpg which is

191
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,240
what we told it to do quality

192
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,949
ninety-five percent we didn't make any

193
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:08,050
changes to this but now when we go to

194
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,270
our computer and we go to that location

195
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,400
where those pictures are we're going to

196
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,430
see all those pictures with their

197
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,050
associated XMP files and a new folder

198
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,919
called darktable

199
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,440
exported and this is the picture that we

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,289
have just modified and processed and

201
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,520
exported as a jpg image so that's just a

202
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,780
quick run-through let's do one with

203
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,120
color just for fun we bring in this one

204
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,979
with color here and then we can see we

205
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,120
have a lot more we have this brightness

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,710
and contrast we can adjust these colors

207
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,410
and adjust the saturation we can make

208
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,810
this a black and white photo we can come

209
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,900
over here there's all kinds of different

210
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,620
options that we're going to look at in

211
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,840
the next video but this toggles whether

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,389
it's enabled or our favorites is going

213
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,830
to be empty by default right now we

214
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,810
click on this color one and these are

215
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,159
kind of some default ones that have a

216
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,960
lot to do with color for example color

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,289
correction so we can apply some some

218
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,360
different color to this and give it sort

219
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,449
of some different you know bring out

220
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,070
sort of the different pixel colors in

221
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,020
here we can also what do we have here

222
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,949
and there's a lot of different ones if

223
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,370
we go to this down here under more

224
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,470
modules there's all kinds of different

225
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,330
ones that we can add in anything we want

226
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,070
so we can do color zones cover

227
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,409
reconstruction color mapping there's all

228
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,259
kinds of different things and we can

229
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,260
apply like yet we want to to this so we

230
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,299
enable this one and now we have this

231
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,770
nice sort of vignette that we can adjust

232
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,440
the size of it and sort of make this

233
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,479
picture a little bit different and again

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
we go back into light table and we see

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,860
that that is changed so I know I'm

236
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,270
rushing through a lot of this I'm doing

237
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,329
a kind of a bigger overview but I think

238
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm going to stop this tutorial here

239
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,180
because in the next video we're gonna

240
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,620
spend a lot more time

241
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,810
in the darkroom going over some of this

242
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,790
I just wanted to show you mostly the

243
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,710
light table in this video and how to

244
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,260
organize and arrange and bring pictures

245
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,350
in to dark table so thanks for watching

246
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,370
I'm sure you have questions at this

247
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,080
point but maybe leave your questions or
