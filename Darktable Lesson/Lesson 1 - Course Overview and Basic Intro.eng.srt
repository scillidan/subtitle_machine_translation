00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,890
hello and welcome to the Start table

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,110
tutorial series I'm Brendan Rix with TJ

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,000
free and in this tutorial series we'll

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,740
learn how to manage and edit photos

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,320
using dark table dark table is a great

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,450
professional program for working with

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,309
photography photographs if you're a

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,320
photographer if you shoot with a DSLR

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,390
camera especially if you shoot in RAW or

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,760
even drone footage can be shot in RAW a

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,500
lot of smartphones can shoot in RAW

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,330
these days if you work with raw you're

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,519
really gonna want to use dark table and

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
it kind of does a lot of the same things

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,510
that people often go to Photoshop or

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,790
 before that does a much much better

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,530
job than those programs do it gives you

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
so much more control over your lighting

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
over the colors and over just really the

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,129
look and feel if your photographs also

21
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,870
it has much much better management tools

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,489
and if you're ever working with multiple

23
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,289
pictures at once like trying to apply a

24
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,270
watermark on hundreds or thousands of

25
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,190
pictures at once it's a great tool for

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,350
that if you're editing the metadata of

27
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,449
the picture if you want to apply the

28
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,890
same thing over and over again like

29
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,859
rotate and zoom in and adjust colors but

30
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,719
do it to like a dozen photos at once you

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,590
don't need to go through and do it

32
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,940
individual you can just use this

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,369
software to do all of that it's kind of

34
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,020
similar to Adobe Lightroom in fact it's

35
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,150
very similar to Adobe Lightroom and even

36
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,740
a lot of professionals choose I've kind

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,900
of went away from Lightroom and they're

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,420
using darktable as their main workhorse

39
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,220
because it's just so professional and

40
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,470
such an amazing piece of software so

41
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,090
it's not one of those free programs it's

42
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,619
just like a limited free and it's gonna

43
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,479
make you try to pay for more features in

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,909
the future this is the real deal fully

45
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,950
professional it just happens to be open

46
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,170
source and free so it's a project owned

47
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,329
by the community for the community this

48
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,799
is the software you need to be using if

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,540
you're a photographer of any kind or if

50
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,759
you work with photos a lot in this

51
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,170
tutorial series we're going to learn how

52
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,970
to use the interface we're gonna dive in

53
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,899
and learn how to use the different

54
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,939
modules different color correcting and

55
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,560
filters and all of the cool things we

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,030
can do we'll learn how to do the batch

57
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,860
editing how to import and export our

58
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,240
pictures and we'll just learn how

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,700
darktable functions what this is not

60
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,930
going to be is a deep way to learn how

61
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,149
to use the individual modules you could

62
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,500
spend years and you probably should

63
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,240
spend years getting experience doing

64
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,439
that that's something I haven't

65
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,850
personally done and I just won't be able

66
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,619
to offer that so once we cover the

67
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,239
basics in this series I hope you'll go

68
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,860
out and find a lot of tutorials that are

69
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,420
there on the web and including on

70
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,360
YouTube you can check out more

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,590
specialized features of how to do a

72
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,500
certain type of enhancement so that's

73
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,910
kind of outside the scope of the series

74
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,350
just know that we're going to learn the

75
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,870
basics and we'll probably stop there one

76
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,250
more thing before I close this video I

77
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,260
just want to talk about when to use

78
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,870
darktable as opposed to Photoshop or

79
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,340
 or credo or somebody's everyone's

80
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,130
so photoshop's gonna be I mean darktable

81
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,630
is going to be really good if you're

82
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,760
working with just photos so when people

83
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,320
do photo enhancements you're adjusting

84
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,300
lighting you're adjusting the size or

85
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,590
the crop or the frame of the image

86
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,240
anything like that it's going to be

87
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,459
great for improving skin tone or

88
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,380
bringing out certain colors or adjusting

89
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,500
parts you know bringing shadows into the

90
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,510
light or adjusting your lighting this is

91
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,950
what you want to do in darktable

92
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,440
if you want to do photoshop and maybe

93
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,900
like edit out blemishes on the skin you

94
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,550
can do some of that stuff in darktable

95
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,270
too but that's something more suited for

96
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,400
 and Photoshop or maybe compositing

97
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,840
multiple pictures on top of each other

98
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,090
working with text or creating any kind

99
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,440
of like brochures things like that

100
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,269
you're going to want to use Photoshop

101
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,190
and for that and if you're creating

102
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,530
art from scratch like you have a drawing

103
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,880
pad or maybe you want to yeah draw it

104
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
with the mouse and draw circles and

105
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,940
create objects then you're going to want

106
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,290
to look into something more like crea

107
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,720
even Inkscape and Photoshop and can

108
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,760
