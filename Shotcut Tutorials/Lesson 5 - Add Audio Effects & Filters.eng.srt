00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,009
welcome back to another shotcut tutorial

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,570
in this video we'll be working with

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,669
multiple audio tracks we're gonna add

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:11,099
music to a video and we're going to look

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,409
at the audio filters and effects in shot

6
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:15,839
cut so to get started I'm going to open

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,519
a file and I'm going to open up just

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,730
this that's an mp3 music file so I'll

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,529
open that up and we see it appears here

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,480
it starts playing its gonna follow the

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,339
same rules as if it were a video clip so

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,140
we can jump to a certain part hit the

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,349
spacebar to play or we can control here

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,540
and play it and we can go reverse go to

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,030
the beginning if we drag this down to

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,220
our timeline it'll appear and it comes

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,730
on as a video track v1 so we can play it

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,230
here and now we're watching it in the

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,070
video track as opposed to our source but

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,480
what we really want is an audio track

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,980
here so we could leave it in in the

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,720
video track it's just gonna play as a

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,960
video with a black background whatever

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,730
the our settings are I think 1920 by

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,340
1080 but if we click on filters here or

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,810
like we learned in the last video we can

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,400
also click filters up here it does the

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,650
same thing it just brings up the filters

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,040
tab and then it says what is selected is

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,880
this Bach concerto in D for two violins

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,850
D minor and it's selected in red and so

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,950
we can zoom out and kind of see this

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,900
selection so anything we apply will

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,330
happen to this entire selection which is

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,610
the entire audio so I'll just click this

36
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,520
plus and if we click on audio it'll show

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,020
us different audio effects so we have

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,180
fade in and fade out of the audio we

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,159
have gain and volume which is I use

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,050
quite a bit to increase or decrease the

41
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,800
volume of a clip balance and pan are

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,470
going to be for like right and left so

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,550
let's click on just to show you I'll

44
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,860
click on this gain volume 1 and the

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,930
option we have here is just level so

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,580
it's just a single level if we hit play

47
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,380
we can look over here in this audio peak

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,240
meter and we can kind of see what this

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,049
is doing here so this is the volume

50
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,470
right now if we adjust it lower the

51
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,690
volume gets softer and we can see over

52
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,940
here it's you know down to negative 40

53
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,960
50 decibels if we go up above 0 it'll

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,969
get louder and if we go too high it's

55
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,258
gonna get red

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,459
and kind of clip out at certain points

57
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,870
so we want to avoid that read whenever

58
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,560
adjusting audio okay well I want to show

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,819
you though so this is on the video track

60
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,319
so suppose we did want to bring in some

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
video too we can go open file we can

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
find some video here so I'll just do

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,129
this go to this clip right here so this

64
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,079
clip already has some audio associated

65
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,819
with it if I were to bring it down right

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,269
now

67
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,299
it would overwrite whatever portion this

68
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,829
white portion it would actually

69
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,400
overwrite the audio we could also do if

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,950
we check this little icon here this

71
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,139
ripple trim and drop what it will do now

72
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,409
it changes from overwrite to insert so

73
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,730
what this will actually do is break the

74
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,579
audio so we'll come in the very

75
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,379
beginning we'll play the audio here and

76
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,370
what it'll do if I were to take that oh

77
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,230
now I lost my video see it's not in the

78
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,700
playlist because all I did was open that

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,170
so we have to reopen the video again and

80
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,920
I drag it down pause we drag it down

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,900
we're gonna point to insert this video

82
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,269
so now the video is inserted here

83
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,769
meaning it'll play the video and then

84
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,799
pick up right where I left off and so

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,560
it's not actually over it didn't

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,010
overwrite the audio if that makes sense

87
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,239
anyway what we can actually do if we

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,410
don't want to have it on the same track

89
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,730
which we don't really that's not ideal

90
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,620
we want to be able to play the waterfall

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,419
and have the music playing in the

92
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,019
background

93
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,449
so we need a separate audio track to do

94
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,129
that we click these three lines here and

95
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,069
we go add audio track now we have an A

96
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,370
one A one down here and V one here so

97
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,169
that a is the audio track and the V is

98
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,090
the video so we see the video has an

99
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,150
option for turning on and off the video

100
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,519
turning on and off the sound this lock

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,620
icon just locks the track and keeps it

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,349
so we can't edit it at all but that down

103
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,669
here on the audio track it has an option

104
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,349
for turning off the audio and locking

105
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,090
but there's no picture because the video

106
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,209
track only has audio with it so then

107
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,680
we'll have to open up because I'm not

108
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,870
using this play the playlist I probably

109
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,180
should do that if we go open file we

110
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,690
have to go back to our audio file

111
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,540
and bring it in here we can drag it to

112
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,890
the playlist and then we won't keep

113
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,050
losing it every time and then we also

114
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,350
drag it down to our audio track so we

115
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,790
put it down here in the audio track it's

116
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,830
to the very beginning and now we'll just

117
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,010
click this and hit delete and that

118
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,630
deleted that just that part of the audio

119
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,340
will click this first part and hit all

120
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,870
that the this one here this is the

121
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,580
ripple delete so it deletes and sucks it

122
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,680
back to the beginning and now we'll have

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,720
both the waterfall and the music playing

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,910
because the video has its own audio

125
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,730
track and the audio is on a separate

126
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,230
track from the video so we have two

127
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,360
audio sources and one video source

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,270
playing and maybe if we find so this

129
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,490
audio down here doesn't have the effects

130
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,020
we applied to it if we click on filters

131
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,760
we see there's no effect because that

132
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,110
effect we applied was up here on this

133
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,790
other one that we deleted so we'd have

134
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,860
to reapply this it sounds like the

135
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,050
waterfall is a little bit too noisy so

136
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,300
we can actually click this plus and add

137
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,700
in this gain volume to the audio of see

138
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,160
what's selected just the video clip so

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,210
we'll turn that down and now that the we

140
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,500
should hear the music a lot more than

141
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,570
than the audio then the audio from the

142
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,560
waterfall

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,790
[Music]

144
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,940
that's kind of cool and then we can add

145
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,620
in other ones too we can do like

146
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,300
balances gonna be left and right if it

147
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,380
comes out of the left speaker or the

148
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,060
right speaker we can add in fade in so

149
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,980
if we hadn't fade in it kind of you can

150
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,070
see we'll zoom in here a little bit so

151
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,780
this little black triangle can be

152
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,490
adjusted right now it's doing about a

153
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,990
one-second fade I think so we didn't

154
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,130
hardly notice that one but let's do a

155
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,380
fade out that when we will notice so

156
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,540
we'll add a fade out and now we'll hear

157
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,340
this sort of fade out to the music oh

158
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,240
[Music]

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,410
I'm sorry I'm applying it to the

160
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,860
waterfall

161
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,890
nothing nothing music no wonder listen

162
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,240
let's come over here I'm gonna cut the

163
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
music to the end of this so we'll click

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,260
here to split and I'll go to the second

165
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,660
having to delete so now while I have the

166
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,520
audio track selected you see a mistake

167
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
that you'll probably make too but I make

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,810
it quite often so I apply the effect to

169
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,490
the wrong clip we see I did a fade in

170
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,470
and fade out to the waterfall and not to

171
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,480
the music so now that the music selected

172
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,840
I'll add in the fade in and I'll add in

173
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
the fade out so now we have a fade in

174
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,810
and fade out applied to both of our

175
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,550
Clips we actually don't even need them

176
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,960
on the waterfall one so I'm just gonna

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,830
get rid of them on here and now we'll

178
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,820
play this so you hear that the audio

179
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,610
fades in and then the idea of audio

180
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,580
fades out so that's kind of cool

181
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,010
not a whole lot of audio effects here we

182
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,470
have what's this one Pass

183
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,780
so this is gonna be like I don't even

184
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,790
know but there's some different options

185
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,169
here if you know audio and you know what

186
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,780
you want to do I do a lot of my audio in

187
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,850
audacity so if I have to do too much

188
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,320
crazy stuff I'll actually edit it

189
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,530
outside in audacity and then I'll bring

190
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,140
it in once it's all once I have the

191
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,080
things to apply to it that I want anyway

192
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,750
that's working with effects and filters

193
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,229
for audio in shot cut and also how to

194
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,970
work with multiple tracks and we can add

195
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,229
in if we want we can add in another

196
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,610
audio track and then we have another one

197
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,560
we can add in a video track and we'll

198
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,630
talk more about that to working with a

199
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,340
lot of different tracks here but if ever

200
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,720
you get a lot going on you can always

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,530
click here and go to make track shorter

202
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,000
then we can see all of all the tracks we

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,370
have going on we can also adjust this if

204
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,110
we want to see more of what's happening

205
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,280
in our tracks and less of what's

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,550
happening up here so yeah go ahead and

207
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,479

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,690
