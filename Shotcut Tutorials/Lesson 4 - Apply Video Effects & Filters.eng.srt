00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome back to another shotcut video

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,900
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,459
going to be learning how to apply a

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,070
filters and effects to your video clips

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,629
so to get started I'm just going to

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,129
bring in a video clip I've got one here

7
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,529
on my computer we'll just do this one

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,810
right here so it starts playing the

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,640
video I can pause it by pressing the

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,509
spacebar and to do so right now we have

11
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,070
the playlist opened up but that's just

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,550
for me your layout might be different it

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,779
seems like different versions have

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,400
different things there's these tabs at

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,480
the bottom we've kind of touched on a

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,090
little bit so filters is one of the tabs

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,540
and it it's just called filters you

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
apply a filter to a video clip either an

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
audio filter or a video filter and that

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,530
will produce an effect there are certain

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,630
filters for like cropping and resizing

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,790
and rotating there's filters for color

23
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,580
there's filters to increase the audio so

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,430
it's called filters in shot cuts another

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,560
way to get to filters is to click up on

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,330
the filters at the top and it just does

27
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,800
the same thing it brings up the same

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,300
thing as if you just click on the

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,190
filters tab and like we've kind of

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,480
talked about in the past if we left

31
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,190
click on this filters we can actually

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,290
move it to a different part of the

33
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,170
interface and then if it gets closed and

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,540
we click filters again up top it just

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,409
appears where it last was at so you just

36
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,700
know that yours might not be exactly

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,070
where mine is these tabs can trade

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,640
places

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,620
but the filters tab is where we get to

40
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,750
all the effects okay so to add an effect

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,940
we actually just click on this plus sign

42
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,900
and so it brings up by default all these

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,820
favorites and then you can search by

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,680
just video effects and just audio

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,750
effects in this video we're just going

46
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,880
to be covering the video effects so just

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,930
to show you kind of what's going on here

48
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,340
we're gonna add like this color grading

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,020
one all we do is just left click on it

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,540
and it applies the filter and so then we

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,520
can change some of the settings for this

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,680
filter we can adjust some of the

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,620
coloring so this is like an extreme

54
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,880
coloring we've done and actually if you

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,400
notice I'm applying this to a clip in my

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,280
source so it's not really applied but

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,270
there's not really anything in the

58
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,530
timeline it's just showing me what this

59
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,540
would look like and then if I add this

60
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,598
down to the timeline it adds it in with

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,329
this effect applied to it

62
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,250
another thing we can do here well just

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,840
show you actually if we just split this

64
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,610
right now we click this button here and

65
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,890
we split it into two separate clips both

66
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,900
clips have the effect applied to it

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,340
because any any clip that has a filter

68
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,280
at effect applied to it will just keep

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,930
that even if it becomes split or moved

70
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,670
around so if you want to increase the

71
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,340
audio for example which we'll cover in

72
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,780
the next video you would increase it on

73
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,209
the entire clip you bring in before

74
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,519
making any edits or cuts to it but now

75
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,810
that these are separate now we could

76
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,430
change them we can change and have them

77
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,829
be different colors so now we have you

78
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,069
know the red and then the green

79
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,120
something to pay attention to as well

80
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,859
whatever clip is selected is the one

81
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,209
you're going to be editing effects for

82
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,790
not the clip that's being viewed so

83
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,230
right now we're on the project tab we're

84
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,060
viewing what's in our project we can hit

85
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,970
spacebar and play it and we're looking

86
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,739
at this green here but if we want to

87
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,090
come over and change the color and make

88
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,670
it a little bit more red we move over

89
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,590
here and nothing's happening well that's

90
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,480
because even though we're looking where

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,549
our playhead is at the clip that's

92
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,400
selected is this one over here so we're

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,079
making changes to that one we're just

94
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,370
not viewing the changes that we're

95
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,870
making if you want to see what we're

96
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,669
changing while we're changing it we have

97
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,949
to move the playhead over here to the

98
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,840
clip that's selected and now when we

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,329
make changes it'll you know it'll show

100
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,419
in there if we want to we can add

101
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,829
multiple effects at once if you want to

102
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,480
apply another effect over top of this we

103
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,489
just click the plus sign again and we

104
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,049
can add like a blur maybe

105
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,269
and so the blur has different settings

106
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,530
obviously because it's a different

107
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,930
effect a different filter and so this

108
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,979
one we can just make the whole thing

109
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,409
really blurry and just get kind of crazy

110
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,299
with it and now we have this kind of

111
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,370
blurry colored video also you may have

112
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,810
noticed it's kind of slows down the more

113
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,129
effects we add and depending on your

114
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,280
computer specs it'll it may not render

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,769
as quickly and in playback like right

116
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:06,950
now

117
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,020
but when we actually export the video

118
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,700
it'll be full speed it won't have that

119
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,060
lag enos to it if we find maybe we want

120
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,339
to get rid of the this blur effect and

121
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,829
go back we can just click the minus

122
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,779
button and it gets rid of whatever one

123
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,210
selected let me bring back another one

124
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,410
note so that we have to cuz I want to

125
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,360
show you something else we can do like

126
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,639
this glow one maybe so it adds a glow

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,960
you can kind of see what it's doing and

128
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,210
to kind of and if we want to see exactly

129
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,800
what it's doing we can just check the

130
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,630
box to the to the left of it right now

131
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,450
it's checked if we uncheck it it takes

132
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,850
the effect off but it still keeps it

133
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,510
over here under you know so we can take

134
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,860
this off and see what our original looks

135
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,350
like without actually deleting the the

136
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,030
filter or the effect that we're we're

137
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,770
using so I'm gonna check both of these

138
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,389
we can see what it looks like and so

139
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,770
sometimes maybe you want to just see

140
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,940
what it looks like before you started

141
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,680
doing the covering but then when you go

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,419
to export you just check this and make

143
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,180
sure that they're all applied I've

144
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,979
reloaded this clip and I've cleared out

145
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,120
all the filters and I actually brought

146
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,010
in four more Clips because I want to

147
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,020
show you another feature we can do with

148
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,000
these filters and that is copying a

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,010
filter and applying it to multiple Clips

150
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,990
so welcome back here to this first one

151
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,940
we'll just go add and we can just type

152
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,350
in up here too so there's one called

153
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,680
like film grain or film dust it's this

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,390
old film just like this old film look

155
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,550
I'll apply this it's really small here

156
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,990
but I'll make it a little bit bigger and

157
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,140
extreme just to kinda show you know

158
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,710
illustrate what's going on here whoa so

159
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,900
now we play we see all this kind of film

160
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,830
dust happening on there go back and if

161
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,539
we want to apply this to multiple Clips

162
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,550
we can just come over here while we have

163
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,350
the clip selected that has the filter

164
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,450
applied to it we hover over and there's

165
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,880
this icon that says copy the filters we

166
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,590
click copy and that'll actually copy all

167
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,630
the filters we only have one applied so

168
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,950
it doesn't really matter but it does

169
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,570
copy all of them to be aware of that and

170
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,520
then we'll come over here to this next

171
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,960
clip that doesn't have any filters and

172
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,450
then hit the paste icon and now this one

173
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,000
should have the same filter with the

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,100
same settings that we gave it so it

175
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,020
gives it a consistent feel across all of

176
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,820
it we come to this one do the same thing

177
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,979
come to this one do the same thing and

178
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,419
now our whole project is going to have

179
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,189
this old film look to it

180
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,349
and so that's a way that you can apply

181
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,599
multiple filters if you do have split up

182
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,399
in different clips but you want to all

183
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,099
have the same filter like there's a good

184
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,229
one - that's like white balance that you

185
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,499
use pretty commonly so for white balance

186
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,959
if you're if all your clips are shot the

187
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,119
same day in the same location but you

188
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,889
want to have them have a consistent look

189
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,409
you can adjust the white balance

190
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,509
accordingly and oops

191
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,899
that was not oh we had we applied white

192
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:46,889
balance to this one is that that's an

193
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,809
example of something what I was talking

194
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,429
about just not to do where we were

195
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,229
making changes to the clip without

196
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,249
looking at it so this is the white

197
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,050
balance here that we can see make it you

198
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,849
know much warmer or much colder anyway

199
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:00,749
