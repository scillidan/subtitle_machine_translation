1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,320
in this video I'll show you how to

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,500
import a sequence of images into shot

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,570
cut and have it be converted into just a

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,749
video so to do this we have a sequence

5
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:14,219
of images here if I just push forward

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,289
this is just looking at them in the

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,800
picture viewer and what we need to do is

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,170
just drag and drop the very first image

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,199
of the sequence into our playlist area

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,599
so you need to click on playlist and

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,400
then drag that in and then while that

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,949
selected click on properties if you

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,210
don't have a properties tab you can also

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,980
get to it by clicking properties up here

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,050
and then we just check this checkbox

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,010
next to image sequence and this has how

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,260
many pictures do you want per frame this

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,250
is only a 20 frame movie but I'll just

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,750
say 1 you could if you wanted to go

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,510
slower you could have more play but then

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,800
we just click and it'll play through

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,290
very quickly or we can hold and click

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,390
and look through with those and then

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,590
once that's done if we go back to our

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,030
playlist that's now converted we can

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,500
left-click and drag it down to the

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,230
timeline and now our videos here in the

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,780
timeline and we can zoom in since it's

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,570
very very small and we can see that

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,830
whole video here if we want to just

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,930
export this short video now we could

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,040
leave it just like this if we're not

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,690
doing any more edits we can just click

34
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,030
up on export and then we can click on

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,800
YouTube which want to export for YouTube

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,440
for example click export file and then

37
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,820
give it a name just call this test under

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:34,890
videos and hit save we'll just call this

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,680
test and then click Save and that will

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,690
export shouldn't take long at all with a

41
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,630
tiny video like this and now that video

42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,420
is done and if we go into the videos on

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,370
my computer where I saved that we now

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,729
have a folder called test oh I put it in

45
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,920
a folder called test and also I already

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,810
