00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,860
hi everyone its Rendon with TJ free and

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,300
in this video we're going to be using

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,269
shot cut to create some highlighted

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,150
areas or rather we're going to make

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,369
parts of the video dark and then mask

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:15,659
out the part that we want to draw

7
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:18,170
attention to so we're going to be using

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,359
masking and first we need to find a part

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,490
of this video that we want to I'll just

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,169
come to a part that we want to highlight

11
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:26,880
so maybe selecting this tool right here

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,859
is a good place selecting the text tool

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,660
instead of having everything be visible

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,800
and it's kind of hard to see the mouse

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,200
right there we can highlight that so I'm

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,120
going to come up here and get a second

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,670
video track I'll right click and go to

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,970
add video track and then I'm going to go

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,270
open other and go to color and I'm just

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,340
gonna keep this as it says transparent

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,830
right now I'll change the color to a

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,980
black and go to actually we can do it

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
opacity maybe I should do that let's do

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,000
this one right here if we can and go to

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,570
select

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,360
I haven't tried the okay doesn't do

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,950
opacity so this is just black that looks

28
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,720
like but what we're gonna do we're gonna

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,489
go into we're gonna drag this down to

30
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,130
the timeline first and then we'll select

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,040
it oh it did do opacity okay great so

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,630
this is already it has some opacity if

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,040
it didn't there's a filter called

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,790
opacity we could add and we just add

35
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,020
opacity and then we can change the

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,760
amount of opacity we want that put into

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,159
this but this is actually less steps so

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,659
we're not going to apply opacity you can

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,850
see it's already it's already made it so

40
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,050
that we can kind of see through but it's

41
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,290
darker and now we're going to add in a

42
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,360
mask so we'll go back to the beginning

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,370
of the clip here and we'll go to filters

44
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,050
and go to add and then we'll just search

45
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,820
for masks and there's a couple different

46
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,950
ones but we're gonna do masks a simple

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,659
shape because we're gonna do a rectangle

48
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,479
and that creates this black rectangle so

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,340
what we need to do is I'm gonna come in

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,270
here so we can see it a little bit

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,570
better

52
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,180
we click on the clip and then we come

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,409
over here to these settings and we can

54
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,350
change the location of it so we change

55
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,630
horizontal and vertical until this is

56
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,299
right over top of the tool that we want

57
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,159
and then we change the size the width

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,140
and height over here so that it's kind

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,479
of smaller and you're seeing the problem

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,029
of course is that it's covering up what

61
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:12,629
we want to see instead of exposing it so

62
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,980
we changed this operation

63
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,489
from over right to subtract and then it

64
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,590
shows the transparent background in

65
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,840
there and it also shows this and we can

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
fine tune if you use your scroll wheel

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,379
over top of the bar it makes really

68
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,440
large adjustments oh that's rotation we

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,030
can reset that back to zero by clicking

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,120
there but if we go back to width if we

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,370
hover over and use our mouse wheel over

72
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,440
top of the numbers with a percentage

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
it'll do a much more fine adjustment so

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,660
I can finally come in here and I could

75
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,140
type it in too but I'll just quickly get

76
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,329
this right to the place that I want you

77
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,250
didn't hear my squeaky mouse wheel and

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
maybe that's about good right there and

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,030
then what we can do is we can apply a

80
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,190
fade so right now if we play this it'll

81
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,069
look like this it just cuts over to that

82
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,959
tool and we can move it so I'll move

83
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,099
this up a little bit we'll move this

84
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,569
back and I can play no cut to that I can

85
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,160
I can left-click and hold and move this

86
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,349
back and we can make it longer make it

87
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,209
display longer to if we want to the

88
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,910
whole thing that's pretty good and now

89
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,069
we can apply a fade and there's a couple

90
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,630
ways to do that we could just click on

91
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,730
the clip and go into filters and add a

92
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,389
fade if we wanted to a video fade or we

93
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,700
can just if I get out of this we can

94
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,410
just come to the clip and hover over and

95
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,630
this black circle appears left click and

96
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,040
hold on that black circle and we can

97
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,840
drag this out as long as we want the

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,359
fade to happen at the beginning and then

99
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,500
the same thing at the end and that will

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
fade in and out any audio or video

101
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,750
associated with the clip so now it fades

102
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
and then we need to click on the clip

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,650
and go to those fade options we don't

104
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,790
need to fade audio because there's no

105
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,130
audio on this clip but the fade video in

106
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,480
we want to make sure we click this

107
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,419
checkbox adjust opacity instead of a

108
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,569
fade instead of fade with black so on

109
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,459
both of them on the fade in and out

110
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,290
we'll make sure that's checked and now

111
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,299
it'll look really cool it'll fade in the

112
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,599
whole thing just like this and then it

113
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,060
shows it and it's going very slow right

114
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,419
now

115
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,560
then it'll fade it out so maybe that's

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,289
even too much and then if we want to use

117
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,590
this same effect or this same mask with

118
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,700
these settings we can just right click

119
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,630
and go to copy

120
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,880
and we can go to another location in the

121
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,140
video to where we're selecting another

122
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,670
tool suppose we're selecting a tool over

123
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,710
here we can come to that location and

124
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,580
just do ctrl V to paste that and now we

125
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,620
have it pasted over here and if it's a

126
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,180
different tool we can just come over to

127
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,760
this vertical and change where that is

128
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,800
at on the vertical so we can change that

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,390
we can even come over here and select a

130
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,070
tool across the top by changing vertical

131
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,930
and horizontal so whatever tool we

132
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,790
happen to be selecting we can just

133
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,760
highlight that and it'll show that tool

134
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,740
and it'll still apply it with the exact

135
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
same fades and everything and if we've

136
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,040
suppose we were doing something over

137
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,740
here we could even it doesn't have to be

138
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,960
just a rectangle so we can come over

139
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,060
here and change or a square we can

140
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,790
change the width here to more like a

141
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,160
rectangular area to cover like a whole

142
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,680
thing or width and height and we can

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,590
come down just like this so this is a

144
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,360
really cool feature you can do the same

145
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,260
thing in kdenlive

146
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,870
and in all kinds of you know all kinds

147
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,950
of different video editors that are

148
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,720
open-source as well I just thought it's

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,940
particularly easy to accomplish this in

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,850
shot cut you can also save these presets

151
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,310
over here like these exact presets if

152
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,020
you want to you can come over here and

153
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,420
go preset and go add and then you can

154
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,470
just call this large box or whatever you

155
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,140
want to call it and then that way if

156
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,120
even after you close the program and get

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
back in you can always come to this

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,330
preset so if you change things over to

159
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,550
here and you want that preset of where

160
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,410
it was over there you just come down to

161
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,130
your large box preset and it sets it up

162
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,230
exactly how it was so thanks for

163
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,310
watching guys if you have any questions

164
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,630
