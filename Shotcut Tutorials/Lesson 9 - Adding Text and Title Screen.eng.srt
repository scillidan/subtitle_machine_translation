00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,890
welcome back to another shotcut video

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,779
editing tutorial in this video we'll be

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,209
adding text as a text overlay on top of

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,369
our video and also adding text title

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,949
screens I'm actually remaking this video

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,809
the last one I made I was having issues

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,000
with shotcut crashing when I was trying

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,550
to do some of the animation and like

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,320
animating text having an move on the

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,990
screen the the reason was as someone

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,939
pointed out on YouTube I was using an

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,800
outdated version so the version I'm

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,410
using now is the latest version the nice

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,850
thing about open source software is it's

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,150
always continually being updated and so

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,500
hopefully I haven't I'm actually just

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,460
remaking this for the first time I

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,900
haven't tested to see if the bugs are

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,730
fixed but hopefully we don't have that

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,410
same crashing issue we were having last

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,750
time so to add text it's actually a

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,690
filter so we bring a video into our

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,150
timeline while it's selected in red we

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,520
just click Add and it's a video filter

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,850
it's just called text and that adds some

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,890
text by default it adds the timecode so

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,530
if we hit play it just shows the current

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,230
time of the video we can also we can

29
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,390
erase that we can do frame so it shows

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,700
the current frame rate of the video not

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,470
incredibly useful for most projects but

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,580
there are some different things you can

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,350
just click here that are sort of

34
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,500
variable to your video file you can also

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,390
obviously just type in your own text

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,880
though so you say in my video and we can

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,590
change the color of the text so if we

38
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,180
wanted to be a different color maybe we

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,590
didn't want it to be like this red here

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,540
we can change the actual font by

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,729
clicking here we can choose a different

42
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,290
type of font that we like and that you

43
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,970
can also change the font size in here

44
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,200
but I wouldn't recommend doing it that

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,240
way to change the size you can either

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,950
come down here and click and just change

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,500
these numbers manually or you can resize

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,780
here by coming in the top right or left

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,970
or bottom corner and resize it there's

50
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,590
also a handle in the middle you can move

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,010
the text around if you get it sort of

52
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,720
maybe off screen or somewhere you don't

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,700
want you can always reset it by just

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,750
coming over here and clicking this

55
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,000
little like reset button that just

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,650
restores everything to how it was before

57
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,619
so we have position and size there's

58
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,330
also an outline that's set to zero right

59
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,549
now the thickness if we bring that up we

60
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,430
can see it gets this kind of black thick

61
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,379
outline stroke on the text and we can

62
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,040
change that

63
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,340
color as well and and then matific dance

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,470
I don't love it oh I always make that

65
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,640
mistake I hit the enter key which

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,140
toggles between our project and our

67
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,180
source so go back to the project

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,620
everything's there if every if maybe you

69
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,569
do the same thing if you hit Enter while

70
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,879
you're on this it'll everything goes

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,989
away and you're like what's going on

72
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,400
here but it's because it takes you back

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,049
to source we need to go back to project

74
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,390
anyway so if we can now we can change

75
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,459
this so the vertical lift if we go top

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,799
it Orient's the text to the top middle

77
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,840
and bottom and that's if it's

78
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
constrained in that orientation if we

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,379
constrain it this way we can go left

80
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,349
right or center so there's multiple ways

81
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,769
to move this text around I would say

82
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,659
just leave everything maybe just I like

83
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,639
to leave it centered actually and then I

84
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,349
can just move this box around and it

85
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,299
kind of behaves the way I think it

86
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,849
should I shoulda show this first maybe

87
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,620
because with the animation there's these

88
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,659
different presets here but it'll reset

89
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,389
all the coloring and any changes we made

90
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,400
to the font but if we go like slide in

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
from bottom left and go back go to the

92
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,739
beginning the text will animate in what

93
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,239
is this slide or slide in from bottom

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,859
not left this is just slide in from

95
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,510
bottom so the text sort of animates in

96
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,780
there and we see that there was a slide

97
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,949
in from the here's slide in from left so

98
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,549
kind of the same thing so some different

99
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,500
ways that you can do that if you want to

100
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,849
make changes to that we'll touch on this

101
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,230
more in a future video but we go to

102
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,359
keyframes and we can actually change

103
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,910
here the speed that comes in so right

104
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,739
now it comes in further quickly we can

105
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,540
click on this handle here there's sort

106
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,599
of this black triangle shaded area so

107
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,909
now it'd be much much slower as it

108
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,150
animates in again we'll touch more on

109
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,609
that that's under this keyframes tab not

110
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,669
under the timeline it's under keyframes

111
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,870
okay one more thing we're gonna try and

112
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,340
do so we'll keep this here but let's go

113
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,159
into add a title screen there's a couple

114
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,470
ways to do it if we go up to here to

115
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,738
open other we can just open a color and

116
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,659
we can just choose right now it's

117
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,130
transparent we can choose like a black

118
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,169
color and then all of a sudden we have

119
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,389
just this black in here we can bring it

120
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,669
over to our playlist and then we can

121
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,850
always just bring it down

122
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,560
we have this yeah so we should be able

123
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,660
to bring this down and insert it into

124
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,900
our video clip so I didn't do that in

125
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,130
the right place but that's okay I'll

126
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,340
just erase this so now we have some some

127
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,980
empty blackness right before our video

128
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,540
and then it kind of jumps in to our

129
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,080
video here so we can get we can select

130
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
this clip we can go to filters we go to

131
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
add text and we can put text right onto

132
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,710
this clip just like we would if it were

133
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,290
a video clip let me show you another way

134
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,970
to do it though if we delete this we can

135
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,910
also go to open other and we just go to

136
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,400
text what that does is by default it

137
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,170
opens up a background with text already

138
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,900
on it and we can put our own text so we

139
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,800
can say this is my video and then we

140
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,330
choose the color of the background this

141
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,110
time maybe let's do a darker blue color

142
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,000
and then we just hit OK and now we have

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,540
a well so this is just up here in our

144
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,220
sources if we navigate away from it

145
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,780
we'll lose it so we can left-click and

146
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,440
bring the whole clip into our playlist

147
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,910
in case we ever want to grab it again

148
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,770
because now if we click up here we're on

149
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,390
something out so we get back to it and

150
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,400
then we can drag it down into our

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,650
timeline and so now we have this text

152
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm on the back of blue and someone

153
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,960
brought up two when we touch on

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,750
transitions with this ripple select or

155
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,520
this ripple trim and drop this let sit

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,900
so if we move forward it'll just

157
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,180
automatically push forward everything if

158
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,610
this were not selected we would create a

159
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,640
transition between these two and and

160
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,290
when bringing in Clips it behaves

161
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,670
differently as well so play with

162
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,040
toggling this on and off I think I

163
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,780
didn't touch on that too much when I was

164
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,990
going over that at the beginning yeah

165
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,430
let's see what this looks like this will

166
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,190
be I can fade crossfade transition with

167
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,860
text anyway hopefully you found that

168
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,300
informative and as you can see we did

169
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,890
some we played with it nothing crashed

170
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,140
so huge shout out to the shotgun

171
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,670
