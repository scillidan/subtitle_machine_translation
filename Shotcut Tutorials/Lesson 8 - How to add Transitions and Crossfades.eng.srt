00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to another shotcut tutorial

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,240
in this video we're going to be looking

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,370
at transitions and crossfades between

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,889
different images and also between the

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,940
video clips and so I'm gonna drag down

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,189
first just left click and drag a couple

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,840
of these down into my timeline these are

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,359
just a few images and then also we're

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,580
going to do just some video clips here

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,439
and I'll resize my video so they're

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,740
about the same length as the images and

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,589
I'm leaving just being a little sloppy

13
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,170
here just leaving some gaps in between

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,420
that's okay because it actually helps us

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,040
illustrate something for these

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,050
transitions so to do a transition what

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,460
we have to do I'm going to zoom in a

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,470
little bit on the timeline to actually

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,930
do a transition we need to just there's

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,300
no filter or something we can add in the

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,040
transitions there's no actual transition

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,740
to drag and drop on top of a clip or

23
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,690
something instead what we have to do is

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,110
actually overlap two clips and it'll

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,180
create a transition but it's not doing

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,770
it if there's a gap in between it won't

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,540
do it because if there's a gap in

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,760
between the program thinks that we're

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,070
trying to move them close together and

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,330
we're accidentally overlapping a little

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,580
bit so it thinks that's an error so we

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,540
have to actually get rid of that gap

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,640
first so if there's no gap in between

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,960
and two clips are touching each other

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,390
then we can left-click the clip that's

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,180
in front and however far we overlap it

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,460
it'll create this little cross this

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,140
little X and we can that's then like a

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,120
little dissolve transition and it's also

40
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,300
an audio Prostate if you have audio so

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,830
like these ones I can move this over

42
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,690
here make them right next to each other

43
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,909
right now it's just a hard cut from one

44
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,090
to the other the audio is kind of is

45
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,650
kind of a loud hard cut with the audio

46
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,860
and the video just cuts over so if we

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,140
drag this one over top again however

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,640
long you want the transition to be maybe

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
a really long transition we leave a big

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,650
gap there and it will slowly transition

51
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,659
to the audio it'll crossfade the audio

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,850
and dissolve the video overtop of it

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,850
so that's pretty cool if you want to

54
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,160
make changes to this under properties is

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,750
where we do that so it's not under

56
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,830
filters while the that X transition box

57
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,830
is selected whether or not where the

58
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,030
playhead is over it but while it's

59
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,220
selected if we click on properties we

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,180
have some different ways we can change

61
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,010
that instead of doing it dissolve we can

62
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,980
do this a barn door horizontal and

63
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,959
that'll do something different it's like

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,750
a comes in from the sides we can change

65
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,329
it to be like this iris box so we can

66
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,640
change different transitions another way

67
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,569
to get rid so now if we move this to

68
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,950
it'll move all of it together so at the

69
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,720
clip in front if we move it it actually

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,310
moves the transition and the clip that

71
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,220
it's attached to another way to get rid

72
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,079
of the this gap here we can just

73
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,319
right-click and click on remove and now

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll actually get rid of a gap so we

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,260
could these ones we can right-click on

76
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,030
the gap here and over remove it and have

77
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,410
like a kind of a ripple delete it this

78
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,510
brings everything in all the other clips

79
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,230
so now we have no gaps here also to do

80
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,420
the transition it has to be the clip in

81
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,340
front so that if we want to have a

82
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,040
transition between this image and this

83
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,980
image the whatever clip is in front has

84
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,139
to be overlapped overtop of the one

85
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,329
behind it if we try to overlap the one

86
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,400
in front so this one will try and drag

87
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,220
it over top it just it'll just move the

88
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,760
whole timeline in that direction so we

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,859
have to drag the one in front overtop of

90
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:36,880
it that makes sense

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,709
so now we have a fade there and fade

92
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,299
there and again we can change all of

93
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:44,829
those this one doesn't have a transition

94
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,209
yet this is just a hard cut from the

95
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,870
picture to the video so we can do this

96
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,139
one too and then this one's the same way

97
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,849
so this one's not gonna have very much

98
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,380
and then we can just get rid of this by

99
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,730
right-clicking and going remove that

100
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,560
space there now we have a bunch of

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,970
transitions most of them are gonna be

102
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,250
the dissolve there's also some options

103
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,639
for the hardness is like if we want it

104
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,449
to just how so can we do we can't do on

105
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:14,769
that one put like on the vertical bars

106
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,290
the hardness is like if it's a hard line

107
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,470
it will just be like that if we have it

108
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,870
all the way down to zero so I guess 100

109
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,850
percent is how how hard and soft it is

110
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,320
so this will be a hard line when it's

111
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,750
2-0 see it's like a straight line just

112
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,700
cutting down as opposed to being like

113
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,630
soft like this so different transitions

114
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,530
have different settings you can adjust

115
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,000
after I think it might just be the

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
softness on all of these ones yeah

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,140
anyway so let's change a couple

118
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,240
different will just randomly select a

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,140
few transitions here and I'll change

120
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:00,310
this one to do that here we have it so

121
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,200
we'll play and look with our look what

122
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
our project looks like we have some

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,740
transitions overlapping we still have

124
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,660
our audio but our audio cross fades

125
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,150
between each clip and that is basically

126
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,210
it that's using transitions in shot cut

127
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,310
hopefully this helped you go ahead and

128
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,290
might come and subscribe and leave your

129
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,340
questions or comments below if you have

130
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,260
any and I'll catch you in the next video
