1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,290
this is a quick video showing how to

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,799
freeze a particular frame in shop cut so

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,179
if we have this video here and doesn't

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,019
even have to be in our timeline

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,629
necessarily we have a video here we can

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:15,929
play this video and let's say there's a

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,699
certain point like this picture right

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,410
here where it's saying 2.0 we want to

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,050
just freeze on this frame sometimes it's

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,500
called freeze or hold the frame we want

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,330
to actually just export this as a

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,890
picture so one way you might imagine is

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,810
to like you can do print screen and then

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,820
crop out the picture but shotgun has a

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,320
way built in to do this we just go to

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
file when we're at that point in the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,810
video and go to export frame and then we

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,070
just choose where to put it we'll put it

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,210
on the desktop we'll just call it

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,640
something miscellaneous here and hit

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
save and now that's saved on the desktop

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,380
as a picture a PNG we can open it up and

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,510
look at just that PNG image so here it

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,820
is and then we can also bring it in so

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,560
we can drag and drop it into shot cut or

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,840
we can go to open file and then we can

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,780
choose to open that door so that desktop

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,800
I'll get a couple things there named

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
miscellaneous stuff and now this is

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,450
actually just the the image so now we

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,460
have the video which is right here it's

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,920
seven minutes long so we can go to this

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,350
video in our store so we can find a

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,440
certain part of the video or if we want

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,360
we can come over here and we can just

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,830
put in if I delete this out of the

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,390
timeline we can drag down just the

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,060
picture so now just this picture will

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,150
play for about two seconds we can make

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,840
it longer or shorter but that is how you

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,850
would hold a frame and so we could put

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,920
part of the video before and part of the

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,440
video after and essentially hold this

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,659
frame in between or we could just grab a

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,790
picture out and do it that way there two

46
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,290
questions leave them below catch you the

47
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,680
next video
