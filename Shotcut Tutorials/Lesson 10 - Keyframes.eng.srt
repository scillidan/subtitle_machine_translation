00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to another shotcut video

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,600
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,400
going to talk about the keyframes

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,339
feature so adding keyframes this is

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,809
getting starting to touch on maybe

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,209
animation or making things change

7
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,060
effects and filters at different points

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,970
of the video so to get started we're

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,429
gonna drag in this video clip to our

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,189
timeline and some different filters have

11
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,480
can be keyframe than some canned in the

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,619
last video we talked a little bit about

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,830
text so when we add text on like if we

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,960
add text we click on video go down to

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,710
text so we have our different text here

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,130
you say my text so this has some options

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,560
for one click on keyframe it has some

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,840
options for when it first appears if we

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,030
that's this green start so if we play

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,790
our video here it won't appear until it

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,890
gets to that point in time and if we

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,560
want to go to the end of this and have

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,990
it only be on for a short amount of time

24
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,270
we just bring it to here so this is all

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,940
happening on this keyframes tab not on

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,410
the timeline tab if you're wondering

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,140
where that green and start end is if we

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,460
come here to the end it just shortens

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,330
the length of the video

30
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,520
so under keyframes is where we get to

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,020
this red and green with these little

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,330
black circles but this will put the text

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,960
on the video just for a short time and

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,570
then again it goes off and if we're

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,180
doing if we zoom in here if we have any

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,090
effects to this this is where it kind of

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,909
changes maybe the position so this is

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,010
actually right now it's the same because

39
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,950
nothing has changed but we could do it

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,830
so by this point one thing we could do

41
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,720
is change the color so if we change the

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,580
color and go to red it's going to be red

43
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,049
at this point but since we didn't change

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,870
it at the beginning maybe that part is

45
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,150
not keyframe well oh it's not so the

46
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,159
text color I guess is not keyframe level

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,770
unfortunately and the reason we can tell

48
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,780
that is there's no icon right here to

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,070
the side of it that says it's keyframe

50
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,659
of all so the only thing that's key

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,090
frame of all of this text is the

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,000
position of it and the size isn't the

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,340
where it's at the justification isn't

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,769
the text itself isn't just the position

55
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,840
is

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,060
and if we hover over that says use

57
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,099
keyframes for this parameter so that

58
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,510
just tells us that it's able to be

59
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,640
keyframe Abul so what we could do now is

60
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,080
move this up to like here and what that

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,510
will do is it'll start down here it'll

62
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,660
appear and then it'll move but it's not

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,370
working properly it move the text box if

64
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,470
it's not moving the text super-annoying

65
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,569
but at least we're learning what's

66
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,209
happening it has sort of let's get rid

67
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,000
of this one altogether because a better

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,840
example is if we do maybe let's do

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,130
another effect like blur

70
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,610
I think blur was keyframe Abul yeah so

71
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,840
we see it has this little icon to the

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,600
side of it use keyframes so we couldn't

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,860
click this we're gonna do that in a

74
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,400
second but for now we can just go to the

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,620
keyframes on it and we can just use this

76
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,750
little slide out so it's going to start

77
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,610
with these settings and by the time we

78
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,769
get to here we can change these settings

79
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,380
we can make it really blurry let's do

80
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,190
this so that should adjust and start out

81
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,410
not very blurry and then gradually get

82
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,660
blurry we probably do it the other way

83
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,260
around

84
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,690
so it gets more and more blurry then it

85
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,260
just stays blurry so if we wanted to do

86
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,700
that other way around we just reset this

87
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,950
to how it was we go to the beginning and

88
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,459
then we make it more blurry to start

89
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,220
with now it'll come into focus as we

90
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,410
play so that's just using the basic

91
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,450
rudimentary this doesn't really it

92
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,420
really gives us two keyframes one at the

93
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,609
beginning and then one word for this

94
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,680
circle is it's a really it's kind of an

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,480
easy user-friendly way to do it but it

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,130
doesn't give us a lot of control because

97
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,220
there's only two keyframes the keyframe

98
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,019
means we can't change anything in

99
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,120
between here we can't adjust and change

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,250
the blurriness right here we can only

101
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,620
change it right at this point of the

102
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,200
circle or at the very beginning of the

103
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,299
clip okay I've loaded in a new video

104
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,680
clip I'm gonna show you the more

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,720
advanced way of doing keyframes in shot

106
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,459
cut I don't have any filters applied to

107
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,200
this right now but while it selected

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,209
we'll apply a filter we could do the

109
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,190
blur again but really any filter that

110
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,490
has this keyframe icon this little icon

111
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,020
that says use keyframes for this

112
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,970
parameter this tells us that

113
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,490
we can use these so what this does is

114
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,460
it'll actually change the coloring of

115
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,520
the clip here and so we can click down

116
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,410
here and all of a sudden that creates

117
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,140
this mid-tones gamma which matches this

118
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,150
and we see this as highlighted in blue

119
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,330
so now any changes we make here will be

120
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,430
applied to this clip and it put a little

121
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,470
dot at the point we were at whenever

122
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,780
when we click that so if we come to a

123
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,960
new point while we're here on the

124
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,210
keyframes and we can make an adjustment

125
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,100
to this so now we make it sort of this

126
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,650
red well we see down here well let's

127
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,820
make it blue just so we're not confused

128
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,840
there's this little red node this is a

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,660
keyframe at this point there's another

130
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,070
keyframe at the beginning so we see

131
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,200
there's two so this is essentially what

132
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,610
we were doing last time where it's gonna

133
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,820
it's gonna fade it's gonna slowly apply

134
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,010
we see that's happening so you look up

135
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,920
here on the actual color wheel we see

136
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,260
that dot just moving by itself and then

137
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,710
it gets that point it'll just stop if we

138
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,180
want it to go to a different color we

139
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,040
can come to whatever point we want and

140
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,660
we can move it down to maybe like this

141
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,020
green and now it's gonna fade to that so

142
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,850
it'll fade to this color then it will

143
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,360
fade over to this more green and it just

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,760
stays at that last one and if we wanted

145
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,740
to go back to how it was originally we

146
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,560
just move it back to the middle and now

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,970
we have this so we have these different

148
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,800
key frames we've now set for keyframes

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,560
just for the mid-tones so all it's doing

150
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,169
is doing the mid-tones maybe we want to

151
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,850
add in another one we can click this one

152
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,830
here this highlights and that'll create

153
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,720
let's not do the highlights let's click

154
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,910
it click yes so we won't do that one

155
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,310
instead let's do a different let's do

156
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,040
well we can do I guess we'll do the blur

157
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,690
since we had that one up before because

158
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,890
the blur has two different ones as well

159
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,650
width and height so under blur we can

160
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,110
add a keyframe in starting right here

161
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,419
and they'll show us the width and then

162
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,330
we can come again to here and make an

163
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,169
adjustment to that oh this one there we

164
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,600
go so now we have it blurred there and

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,700
then we come back down to this point and

166
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,410
go reset

167
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,620
so now it's going to blur but it's also

168
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,300
still applying those colors

169
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,310
it gets really blurry up at this point

170
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,610
here then it goes back down to be not

171
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,980
blurred and back to the normal colors so

172
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,650
we have two different filters applied

173
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,320
but we need to click on them to see so

174
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,300
listen has chose the mid-tones this one

175
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,010
shows the blur but there are each on

176
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,960
their own and so unless it's selected

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,230
we're not gonna see which one there is

178
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,810
that makes sense but I guess we could do

179
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,490
this one so we could up these ones we

180
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,960
can apply and have three different ones

181
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,330
as long as it's on the same filter when

182
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,580
we go to a new filter it doesn't show so

183
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,390
we can't see width on the same keyframes

184
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,640
tab I guess you could say as these

185
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,100
different colors but we can color these

186
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,390
and add these and they're gonna be all

187
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,760
their own separate ones and so we get

188
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,130
all these different kinds of adjustments

189
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,040
happening here and then we just see some

190
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
craziness going on with coloring and

191
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,970
also with a second it should blur here

192
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,690
as we go in to blur that makes sense

193
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,830
what's going on if you've never used

194
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,690
keyframes before it can be confusing if

195
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,340
you have used keyframes you should be

196
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,630
pretty familiar with what's going on

197
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,490
here these ones are just setting since

198
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,290
there's so many data points these things

199
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,910
are just setting the actual point

200
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,460
whereas this one is actually showing the

201
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,890
level so we can instead of clicking up

202
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,240
here under width we can actually click

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,430
the node now and we can take that blur

204
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,860
up or down so this this line is

205
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,080
representing the intensity whereas the

206
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,210
other one wasn't we can do the height on

207
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,400
this one too so if we add in height and

208
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,100
we go to this point and just make some

209
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,000
sort of a change and then come here so

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,320
now we're adding in a few different

211
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,720
things so now we have to we're adjusting

212
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,610
this height and this width if you watch

213
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,800
these bars as I play these bars are

214
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,190
slowly changing you know back and forth

215
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,210
to do some interesting types of things

216
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,340
so any filter that you find any filter

217
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,330
at all that has the audio so we have

218
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,930
this gain and volume is keyframe Abul so

219
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,030
we could we could apply an adjustment to

220
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,740
the volume and have it be a different

221
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,250
volume level at

222
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,279
point then another point we can apply a

223
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,899
lot of these a lot of the different

224
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,629
effects just look at to see if they have

225
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,550
it so sharpen is going to have it most

226
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,569
of the effects are going to have these

227
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,399
icons so play around with those

228
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,720
hopefully you found this video

229
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,389
informative really experienced and just

230
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,949
playing and seeing what happens when you

231
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,629
apply different keyframes and changing

232
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,160
them is what's really gonna help you

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,949
learn how they work and so play with

234
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:18,149
that go and leave your questions and

235
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,189
comments below and I'll catch you in the

236
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:22,699
