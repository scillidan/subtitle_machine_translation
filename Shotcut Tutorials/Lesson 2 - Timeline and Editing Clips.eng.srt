00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome back to another shotcut video

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,660
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,030
gonna spend a lot more time on using the

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,369
timeline editing our video we're

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,419
learning about lots of different tools

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,730
to do that so to get started we'll just

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,619
type in a project name and hit start and

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,390
then if again like like in the last

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,710
video if yours doesn't look exactly the

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,380
same way we can click on settings and or

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,029
click on View and go to layout and

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,199
choose from some of these different

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,880
layouts but the most important thing is

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,130
to have this playlists active so you

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,870
might have filters you can go down here

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,040
and click on playlists

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,020
if playlist doesn't appear you can click

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,150
on playlist and it'll bring it up so

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,340
once we have playlists then we can

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,710
actually go to our video clips so I have

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,900
some clips selected here I just hit hold

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,970
down the shift key and select multiple

23
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,940
clips and then left click and drag and

24
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,360
drop them in and that it starts playing

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,490
so we have all these clips in here that

26
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,550
I just brought in from my computer

27
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,930
another way to bring in clips is to just

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,390
go to open and then you can select

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,550
multiple clips or individual clips and

30
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,710
it will add them here as well this one's

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,590
already I already brought it in once and

32
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,070
so if we double click on one of these in

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,990
the playlist it shows us what we're

34
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,810
looking at as our source our project is

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,370
not active yet there's nothing in our

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,860
actual project and down here there's

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,780
that there's also timeline and keyframes

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,550
and I just want to mention if you're on

39
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,470
keyframes and you try and drag a video

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,260
down it's not gonna go down it's not

41
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,780
gonna go into your project because you

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,640
don't have any project you have to go to

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,710
Timeline and then you can drag it in and

44
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,750
then you'll actually have this video

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,140
track so right now I just brought this

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,450
video in here and we can bring it right

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,070
to the beginning if I want to have a

48
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,930
different video clip like this one here

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,320
I can drag it down and now I have a gap

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,330
in there as well and if I want to bring

51
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,310
in this is like a very long video it's

52
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,650
one minute and 29 seconds I'm not very

53
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,690
long but it's a if I bring it down it's

54
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,100
going to take up quite a bit of space on

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,260
my timeline and I can zoom out and see

56
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,360
compared to these first two this one's

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,810
pretty long which is fine so I can

58
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,609
left-click and move these around but

59
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,230
maybe I only want a small portion of

60
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,830
this

61
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,420
video there's a couple ways to get just

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,850
a portion so I can find the part that I

63
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,860
want maybe this part where he's

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,560
hammering on this piece of iron we just

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,620
get to play head to that portion and if

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,180
we hover over this tool we can see what

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,860
it's called this tool is called split at

68
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,740
playhead if we can click it and it will

69
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,390
split the video right where the playhead

70
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,060
was now I have two video clips this one

71
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,880
and this one if I hit play they're gonna

72
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,590
seamlessly go right next to each other

73
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,080
because it's even though there are two

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
video clips you know we split it so it's

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,910
supposed to be there if we click this

76
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,680
first one I hit the Delete key it'll go

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
away and then we can come to the portion

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,430
maybe we only want to have the hammering

79
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,740
happen during this you know about this

80
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,690
length we hit the split again select the

81
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,620
second part of the video by left

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,850
clicking on it and hitting the Delete

83
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,800
key on the keyboard and now we just have

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,130
a nice short video clip of just

85
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,220
hammering on this piece of steel I can

86
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,750
left-click and drag it and bring it

87
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,640
closer into my project actually I'm

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,690
gonna bring it away for one set because

89
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,730
I want to show you another way if I want

90
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,530
to have this video clip of this horn

91
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,410
looks like a Powderhorn

92
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,870
we can left-click here and we can shrink

93
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,610
this down as well so we hover to the end

94
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,010
of the video clip hold down left click

95
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,310
and we can make that video shorter so

96
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,780
now I have a couple short clips here

97
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,269
they even publish it I made even a

98
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,340
little bit shorter than that but I want

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,050
to show you another way we can do so

100
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,820
this one here if we go back to our

101
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,350
source on this one we see now we're

102
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,820
playing and it's not moving on our

103
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,870
timeline because we're looking at our

104
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,850
source but if I want to get just this

105
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,510
portion of the fire I can actually come

106
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,239
over here and I can click these little

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,450
triangles now I can select just a small

108
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,950
portion of video here and I can drag it

109
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,108
down so maybe it's a teeny tiny portion

110
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,329
I can left-click and drag and now it

111
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,459
brings in just this little sliver of

112
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,740
video it doesn't bring in the whole one

113
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,419
minute and 29 seconds worth it just

114
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,160
brings in this little tiny portion right

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,620
here

116
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,510
so we can play that and see what looks

117
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,400
like another good way to do that is go

118
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,470
back to the source we can change if we

119
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,120
want the out point instead of dragging

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,220
this triangle we can just go to that

121
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,080
portion and hit the O key on the

122
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,360
keyboard and that selects the out point

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,130
we can go to this part and select the I

124
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,930
key on the keyboard I select the end

125
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,630
point so while that's playing we can

126
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,550
press I then press o on the keyboard and

127
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,470
now we've got a tiny little sliver of

128
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,050
video that we can use so play with that

129
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,729
it's a really really good tool and it's

130
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,590
similar functionality you'll find in

131
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,190
lots of video editing software if we

132
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,780
want to get rid of a clip again we

133
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,450
left-click it'll be selected in red we

134
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,639
have the Delete key and it goes away but

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,000
there's a gap now there's a black gap

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,160
that'll play this black nothingness and

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,500
then it jumps to the next part of the

138
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,950
video so if I hit control Z it'll undo

139
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,990
that change will come back you can also

140
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,070
go to edit undo to bring it back but if

141
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,020
I want this clip to disappear and I want

142
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,880
the gap to not be there I want this

143
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,740
video to just kind of shrink up and

144
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,750
appear right there let me zoom in a

145
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,789
little bit so we can see that more we

146
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,289
could actually just click the cut over

147
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,080
here and we'll cut that clip out and

148
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,300
then everything just shrinks up right to

149
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,810
her it was going to be before and now

150
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,789
that video clip is now saved in our

151
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,490
clipboard so if I want to we come over

152
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,740
here to the playhead I can hit the paste

153
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,289
icon and now that video that I cut out

154
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,260
is gonna be pasted here at the end so if

155
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,849
I want to move this clip to the end

156
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,820
without creating a gap I mean I could

157
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,430
just left-click and move it but now

158
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,349
there's a gap there so if I want to move

159
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,849
it to the end without creating a gap I

160
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,360
had the cut I select it first hit cut

161
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,030
and then go to how the playhead to go to

162
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,919
wherever I want it to paste it which

163
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,200
will lead to the end and hit paste now

164
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,270
I've effectively moved that to the end

165
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,919
without creating any gaps does that make

166
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,289
sense maybe I want this portion over

167
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,539
here I can play it see what this looks

168
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,050
like

169
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,910
I want this portion of the video to play

170
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,550
multiple times well what I can do is hit

171
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,680
the copy so I copy

172
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,240
now that's copied to the

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,370
bored and now I can paste it I can go to

174
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,130
the end and hit paste and it paste this

175
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,560
video so it's still over here but it's

176
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,160
also over here and I can just keep

177
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,020
hitting paste a couple times really so i

178
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,699
wherever the playhead is is where it

179
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,770
will paste it in so if i want this to be

180
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,470
between these two i hit paste and it

181
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,630
appears between those two so if i wanted

182
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,520
to here i come right to here and hit

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,550
paste and now it appears there so now we

184
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,430
have kind of this fire happening in

185
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:18,300
between every little clip what else

186
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,970
snapping do we talk about snapping so if

187
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,069
we want to snap to the playhead I have

188
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,770
snapping enabled right now if I take it

189
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,099
off it's this little magnet magnet icon

190
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,409
if I have that off then it's gonna be a

191
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,210
little bit harder for me if I try and

192
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,889
drag this clip right up here I'm always

193
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,840
gonna have a little bit of like a little

194
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,639
yellow gap in there I'm not gonna get

195
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,580
right to it because it's kind of hard

196
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,530
without snapping but what snapping does

197
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,719
is it makes it so that we always snap

198
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,479
right to the clip so what kind of pauses

199
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,789
and lets it snap to a clip or to the

200
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,740
playhead if I want this to snap to the

201
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,270
playhead it'll also kind of pause a

202
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,460
little bit and let me snap right to the

203
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,550
playhead if I have a gap and I want to

204
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,130
move a video in and the gap is not large

205
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,800
enough I can't get the video in there so

206
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,539
sometimes you'll be like this video will

207
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,770
fit there won't it and you're wondering

208
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,990
why it won't go well it's because you

209
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,780
don't have a big enough space that's

210
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,370
only when you're moving video from

211
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,860
within the timeline if you're bringing

212
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,050
in video from up here like this one with

213
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,069
the horn if I drag this down it's

214
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,440
usually it gives me a warning oh I guess

215
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,110
maybe it'll do it there but if I have it

216
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,729
selected here and I drag it down it's

217
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,010
gonna say overwrite so it's gonna say

218
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,289
warning this is like where by dragging

219
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,969
this clip in if you drag it in right

220
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,770
here now you're gonna overwrite

221
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,630
everything that's we'll kind of shaded

222
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,870
white here which would mean this all

223
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,910
these video clips will be gone and it'll

224
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,190
cut into this one and cut into this ones

225
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,350
that make sense let's give it a try so

226
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,420
we bring it down and we bring it there

227
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,829
now this video clip is here and

228
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:56,329
everything else that was there is now

229
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,700
gone so just be aware of that when

230
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,529
you're bringing in video clips it's good

231
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,120
to bring them into like a blank space

232
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,610
over the back to my source it's good to

233
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,990
bring them into the blank space at the

234
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,760
end of yours if you're worried about

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,410
over writing and it'll tell you if

236
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,850
you're gonna overwrite it or not so I

237
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,990
think that's all we're gonna do in this

238
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,100
one if ever you're wondering what

239
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,260
something does you can hover over and

240
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,339
see what these different things do and

241
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,399
so like the ripple delete does kind of

242
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,779
similar to what we're talking about is

243
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,070
where it gets rid of it and then

244
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,570
everything sucks in so it's the same as

245
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,089
doing kept so if you click on a clip and

246
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,820
then hit ripple delete it deletes it and

247
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,130
sucks in everything without leaving an

248
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,410
empty gap here so yeah and then the

249
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,660
scrub this is this enabled scrubbing so

250
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,910
that when you move a video clip you can

251
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,170
hear what's happening with it at the

252
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,380
same time that's kind of I don't really

253
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,240
use that feature so I think I'm gonna

254
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,800
end this video here go ahead and play

255
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,750

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,760
timeline play with some of these cut

257
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
copy and paste tools you can also use

258
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,250

259
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,130
ctrl C to copy and ctrl V to paste go

260
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,300

261
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,820
with adding in different clips make sure

262
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,630
you know the difference between your

263
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,089
source and your project and on your

264
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,279
source play with some of the in and out

265
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,529
of selecting just a certain portion so

266
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,060
you don't have to come down here and you

267
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,519
know cut it out by splitting it playhead

268
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,459
all that and then be aware too you can

269
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,140

270
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,029
