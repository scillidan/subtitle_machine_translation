00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,130
welcome back to another shot cut video

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,900
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,879
going to learn how to export our project

4
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,969
into a video or in any format we want so

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,110
to get started I'm just going to type in

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,369
something here

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,140
I like test2 and hit start so I have a

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,269
video project here just empty we'll drag

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,980
in a couple I have some files on my

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,880
computer will drag in this one it will

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,539
also drag in this one I'll drag in a few

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,450
here pause this so now I have a couple

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,250
different video files I'm going to drag

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,770
just down to the timeline and in fact

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,850
we're not gonna do the whole thing we'll

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,530
shrink this way way way down by left

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,730
clicking here at the end of the video

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,470
we'll take this down to just a couple of

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,780
seconds and then we'll grab this one and

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,730
this way we're gonna we're gonna choose

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,440
our in and out point of the video here

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,080
and grab a few seconds of this and then

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,680
this last one right there this last one

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,770
I'm going to will bring it in as well

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,200
the whole thing and I'll just select a

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
portion here and go split at playhead

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,630
and we'll go split at playhead just so

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,150
we can see a few different ways there to

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,550
adjust the size of our Clips so now we

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,600
have three different Clips in here and

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,470
make this a little bit longer okay we

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,630
have three video clips in our project we

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,860
can play and see what this looks like

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,990
it's a 4 second video clip alright

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,909
that's a fun video so we got about 4

36
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,010
seconds of video here if we want to

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,050
export this now because we do have a

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,670
project we see when we're clicking on

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,010
project we have a timeline we have three

40
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,020
video clips in a single video timeline

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,479
and there's also audio associated with

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,380
this video we can export this

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,610
intuitively sometimes you people just

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,010
think if you click file and go to save

45
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,830
it's gonna save your video that saved a

46
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,920
test to MLT so it's saved a video

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,530
project file that we can then open up

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,729
and they'll show it just like this

49
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,920
that's a good thing to do but that's not

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,350
a video we can play or upload to youtube

51
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,598
or share with friends to get an actual

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,279
video that we can share we need to click

53
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:11,630
on

54
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,030
sport so we click export' here and it

55
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,370
brings up a new dialog over here it

56
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,740
actually was already here by the way we

57
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,510
can toggle between playlists where we

58
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,400
were looking at our different source

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,550
files and export we can just toggle

60
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,490
between there there's also filters

61
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,900
properties but right now we're on the

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,210
export tab and so if that gets closed or

63
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,440
for whatever reason that's not showing

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,810
up for you just click export and it'll

65
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,270
appear somewhere in your interface but

66
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,430
probably here on on the left it gives us

67
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,020
some options for how we want to export

68
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,360
this it says you know what do you what

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,790
do you want to do do you want it to be

70
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,290
for YouTube you can click you to it has

71
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,180
a preset for that do you want it to be a

72
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,990
WebM file extension if you want it to be

73
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,950
just the mp3 just an audio file or we

74
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,360
have all these different settings here

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,580
but for the most part if you know a

76
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,020
specific thing that you want you can

77
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,550
explore some of these other ones down

78
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,320
here but we're just going to do I

79
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,000
actually do a lot of this h.264 main

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,190
profile but I think it's very similar to

81
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,900
YouTube so I'm gonna click on YouTube

82
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,750
and we'll use this as our profile so

83
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,700
YouTube is now selected all we have to

84
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,800
do is hit export file and it brings up

85
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,590
this dialog that says it says wear on

86
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,240
your computer who you want to save it so

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,850
we'll just we'll call it test dot -

88
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,060
let's save it under videos and we'll

89
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,980
call it test out - under videos and then

90
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,380
hit save and it takes we see it

91
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,480
processing over here so it's rendering

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,100
this video it's a 50% done now what it's

93
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,930
doing is just going through we didn't do

94
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,610
money we just did some edits some splits

95
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,410
is all we really did so it's done now it

96
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,390
didn't take too long and now I can open

97
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,820
up on my computer and go to videos and I

98
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,700
can find that video called test2 and we

99
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,430
can click play and we can play it

100
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,430
let's see what that video looks like so

101
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,129
that's it just playing on the computer

102
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,860
and that's an mp4 file so if we wanted a

103
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,590
different file format we could choose

104
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,879
one of these other ones like maybe we

105
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,699
want to burn it to a DVD and so I'm not

106
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,750
quite sure actually how this will work

107
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,519
if we can actually if we go to export

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,858
file yeah here we go so this is going to

109
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,250
be a dot VOB file so we hit save and now

110
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,930
it's just a different type of file

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,840
that's kind of formatted ideally for

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,060
burning to a DVD that's gonna be played

113
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,300
in North America NTSC if we want just

114
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,919
the audio portion we can click on this

115
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,010
mp3 or WAV let's do mp3 and go to export

116
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,410
file and now it's going to be test -

117
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,300
dot-mpeg and that happened very quickly

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,180
so now when we go to that directory I'm

119
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,970
on my computer under videos we see I

120
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,570
have an mp3 file it's just the audio

121
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,150
portion of my video project see that and

122
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,370
it's just playing in VLC player so

123
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,560
hopefully that kind of makes sense

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
there's lots of different ways you can

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,520
export it's not just one video if you're

126
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,560
not familiar with video formats there's

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,510
a lot of different video formats but

128
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,770
probably the safest thing for you to do

129
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,449
is just click this YouTube format and

130
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,010
export it in YouTube if you're gonna be

131
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,050
sharing this video on the web if you're

132
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,240
doing something more higher quality you

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,599
might do like this h.264 high profile or

134
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,400
some of these other different profiles

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,090
down here that maybe give you some more

136
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,349
detail and higher quality than just

137
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,510
sharing online also if you're curious

138
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,919
about these what's happening you can

139
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,720
click on advanced and it tells you more

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,310
information about the codec being used

141
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,830
about how the audio is being saved and

142
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,870
you can actually make changes to this

143
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,250
too if you know what you're doing and

144
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,199
you can save it as you know different

145
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,780
containers different audio different

146
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,510
video formats but that's if you know

147
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,800
what you're doing if not just click on

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,370
YouTube and export file hopefully you

149
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,310
found this video informative in the next

150
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,270
couple tutorials we're gonna be playing

151
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,340
more with applying video and audio

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,340
effects working with multiple video and

153
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,860
audio tracks in the same timeline so

154
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,450
stay tuned for that

155
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,530
catch you in the next video
