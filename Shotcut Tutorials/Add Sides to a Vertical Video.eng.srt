1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,080
in this video I'll show you how to

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,509
better format a video that's been taken

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,249
like this in the kind of vertical

4
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:10,349
position and add some blurred sides to

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:10,650
it

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,079
in shotcut so what we're gonna really do

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,869
is drag and drop this down once to the

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:17,310
video track and then we're gonna add a

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,140
second instance so I'll right-click and

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,420
go to add video track and I'll do the

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,830
same thing I'll go back to the very

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,720
beginning and I'll drag this down again

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,599
so now we have it in duplicate and I

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,070
only need the audio one so I'm going to

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,779
turn off the audio on the second video

16
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,090
track and now when we play we're just

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,440
gonna see what's happening on top of

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,180
this first video track all right and

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,000
then back below we'll just see we can't

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,250
really see what's happening underneath

21
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,420
let's take our let's go to the bottom

22
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,690
one and let's go to filters and let's

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,160
just add a size and position filter so

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,630
we'll add size and position on here and

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,670
then all of a sudden we see it goes over

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,860
to this black area so we can see if we

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,890
move this it it goes behind this one so

28
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,180
we're manipulating the bottom track

29
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,780
right now well all we have to do is take

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,010
and go to distort is what we want on the

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,020
size mode and then when that's done

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,580
we'll apply a blur so we'll apply this

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,040
like a will do blur and we'll do with a

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,890
Gaussian blur Gaussian and we'll turn

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,720
that up so it's quite blurry on the

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,840
sides there and now when we play this it

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,340
will kind of play through and we see

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,950
what's happening on the side like easier

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,229
way to do it and then we could even take

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,750
this original top one and apply a kind

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,540
of a crop to it so we can add a size and

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,360
position here and we can just scale it

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,130
so it's not really going to be we're

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,390
gonna be moving it towards the center

45
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,979
and we'll really just make this a little

46
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,630
bit larger so instead of really doing a

47
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,220
crop what we're really doing is just

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,750
kind of making this a little bit larger

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,120
here and depending on your video you

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,740
could kind of adjust it too but see

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,360
there's a lot of space up on the top

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,159
that's kind of wasted there so I might

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,560
enlarge that sort of like this and then

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,540
put it back to the center I could have

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,670
also used the edge crop for that and now

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,500
when we go through and play this it's

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,269
going to look sort of like this and then

58
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:10,619
when I render this out it's going to be

59
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,209
much it's gonna have much smoother

60
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,800
playback it's just a little bit

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
right now because I'm dating it in an

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,060
online software but to render it I would

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,460
just click on export go to export file

64
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,290
and then choose the location on my

65
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,690
computer where I want to export this but

66
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,820
that's basically a quick look at adding

67
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,580
in these blurred edges and kind of

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,070
reframing a video that'll have take up

69
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,720
the full area instead of having those

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,730
black bars on the side hopefully found

71
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,170
them formative thanks for watching catch

72
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,070
you in the next video
