00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Welcome back to another Shotcut video editing tutorial. In this video we're

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,080
going to be learning how to scale and change the size and rotate our video

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,760
clips. So I have three clips loaded in here. I'm just going to drag one of them down to

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,800
the timeline and we'll zoom in a little bit here. So it is a filter that we're

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,840
going to apply to do that. So we go into filters like we've done in the past. We

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,800
click add and then there is a filter and effect for that under video. So the ones

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,440
we're going to be doing is rotate and scale and size and position. So the first

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,120
one we'll do is just rotate and scale. It's a little bit easier to use in my

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,000
opinion. So the scaling is just based off a percentage. So it's 100% right now. If

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,880
we scale it up we can zoom in. If we scale it out we can zoom out a little bit

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,200
there and make it smaller. But we can't actually click over here and make any

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,520
changes. We just have these four different options. Scale and we have

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,440
rotation. We can turn it you know 90 degrees, 180 degrees and if we ever want

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,640
to get it back to zero we could try and find exact zero on here or we can just

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,720
click this button and it resets any changes that we've made. So if we want to

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,360
just reset everything back to how it was we just do that real quick. Offset is

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,360
going to be basically our position. So that means we can scale up and find a

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,200
certain point in here. So that's one way to kind of position the video and scale

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
it. Okay I want to show you another way to do it. So we'll click the minus sign

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
we'll get rid of that. Everything's back to how it was. So we'll add in now, scroll

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,360
down under video or we can even just type in. Scale and Rotate is what we did.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,960
So the next one is called size and position. It's not called transform which

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,800
is what I'm used to in CaydenLive and some other video editing programs. It's

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,880
called size and position but basically it's similar to transform. This one when

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,640
it's applied it does give us some handles. We can click here left click and

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,760
actually move the video around. So kind of accomplishing the same thing as that

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,400
offset on the X and Y axis. We can also click these handles and just scale it up

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,320
and down and right now we're doing the size mode is set to fill which means

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,120
it's going to scale according to whatever I it's going to keep the X and

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,760
Y axis the same. So it's not going to distort but if we click distort then we

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,400
actually can scale and make this like very skinny. But if we want to reset

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,120
that we can just reset everything. See as I move these it's actually changing

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,680
these numbers over here. The position and the size. So if I move this one it moves

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
just the position on the X and Y. So I can come over here and put a 2 in and it

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,160
moves it over here. I can put an 8 in it'll move it over here towards the

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,280
right and so I can change the size as well. This way I can have it be we'll

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,160
change this one to 400 and then it's like much smaller. Anyway I can reset

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,080
all of these back to how they were by default. There's also this little button

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,720
here which sets a key frame. We'll learn about this in the future but this lets

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,560
us actually change the position and move that position so we could have our video

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,760
like slowly animate and move across the screen. So check out a future tutorial

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,600
learning how to use key frames. You can do the same thing with the with the

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Rotate and Scale as well. So Rotate and Scale has these options here. We click it

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,680
and it adds a key frame down here and we can actually have different we'll learn

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,360
how to do that in the future. So don't worry about that just click on it again

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,560
and you can just get rid of it. Anyway that is size and position. Go ahead and

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
play with those. Oh and right now I have both applied. Just so you know you can

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,280
have both applied at the same time. So we can rotate this and then come into our

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,160
size and position and then we can move it on within there but it gets a little

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,160
bit crazy. So see right now because it's because we've rotated it's doing it we're

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,120
moving at kind of one within the other and we can actually rotate we can move

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,800
this and see which one has priority as well. Whether we have rotate on top or

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,240
size and position it'll do whatever whatever filter it gets to first is what

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,360
gets processed first. So just be aware that can happen. I would recommend

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:12,680
sticking with one or the other and not both. But that is using yeah scale, rotate,

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,120
size, position. It's a filter in Shotcut. Go ahead and play with those and the more

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
you use them the more familiar you'll get with them. If you have any questions

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
let me know. I'll do my best to answer them and I sincerely thank you for

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
watching and look forward to seeing you in future tutorials.
