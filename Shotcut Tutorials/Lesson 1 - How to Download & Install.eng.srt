1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,140
in this video I'll show you how to

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,720
download shot cut on windows shotgun is

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,459
a free and open source video editor

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,099
let's just go to google and search shot

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,799
to cut all one word and the website

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,079
address is shot cut or I'll include the

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,130
link in the description of this video

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,609
and go ahead and just click on downloads

9
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,320
so this is legitimately free software

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
but you have to be careful oh these are

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,560
ads that are for something else this

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,839
start now over here and these are gonna

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,220
change it might be different for you

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,769
just make sure the actual download link

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,300
is a little confusing it's just a plain

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,490
text you can hover over and click on and

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,650
so any of these would actually work

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,660
you'll probably want to avoid the zip

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,460
and just get the Installer either the

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,250
64-bit or 32-bit and doesn't matter if

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,870
you download it from site one or site -

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,280
it's just multiple options to download

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,620
from I'm gonna do it from site 2 which

24
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,510
is github and I'm gonna do the 64 bit

25
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,580
installer that'll probably be the best

26
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,010
choice for you as well just keep in mind

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,720
if you do have an older computer like

28
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,060
very old you'll want to do the 32-bit

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,830
installer or maybe an older laptop or

30
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,030
something but most computers these days

31
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,260
are 64-bit so this is downloading and

32
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,440
I'll pause the video and speed this up

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,910
ok that's finished downloading now so I

34
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,160
can see the Downloads on Firefox by

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,990
clicking here and it shows me I can

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,490
click this folder and it'll open up the

37
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,659
location that it's saved on my computer

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,230
or I can just open up the file explorer

39
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,240
and go to downloads which is where a

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,650
downloaded on my computer and it's this

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,130
shotcut - win 64 so I'll click on this

42
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,530
file and since it's not the zip it'll

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,020
just start installing right away so it

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,240
brings up the dialog I agree to the

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,860
terms and conditions I just leave

46
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,930
everything though at the defaults and

47
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,110
click Next and install I'll speed this

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,710
up to this part here ok there you have

49
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,299
it so shotcut is now installed on my

50
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,310
computer I can close out of all of these

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,780
and if I click the start button on my

52
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,080
computer and just type in shot cut it

53
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,170
comes up and I can create a desktop icon

54
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,200
for it too but here we have it so this

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,380
is shot cut and I'll just show you real

56
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,270
quick just to get started so it starts

57
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,440
out with filters here but if we want to

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,049
change we can click on settings and and

59
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,379
we can go to layout and we can change -

60
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,920
this time

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,660
line project is kind of what this here

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,180
by default we can also go to layout and

63
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,239
go to clip only so there's just some

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,520
different options here and there's also

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,849
restore default to layout if we want to

66
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,130
anything else a different dialogue you

67
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,020
can click up here to toggle the history

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,510
being shown the peak meter being shown

69
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,819
if something gets closed on the

70
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,050
interface you can just click like

71
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,300
Timeline up here to bring it back but to

73
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,830
in a project name and then we'll drag

74
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,660
some video in and you have to click on

75
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,930
playlist that's the most important part

76
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,250
you can just go file open to if you do

77
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,810

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:58,530
