00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,860
welcome back to another shop cut video

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,840
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,519
going to be learning how to increase the

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,190
speed that our clip is played back so we

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,139
can do slow motion we can do fast speed

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,940
and so I'll show you how to do that you

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,590
may have noticed so I have a video

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,330
brought in here on my timeline if you've

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,980
been looking at filters maybe you've

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,320
already tried to type in speed to look

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,800
for a speed or a slow filter or effect

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,359
and you're not finding it well that's

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,980
because it's treated a little bit

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,230
differently in shot kit it's actually

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,540
under properties so when our clip is

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,490
selected and has read around it we're

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,110
gonna see the properties of whatever

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,650
clip is selected and it's only the clip

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,150
that's selected so if we were to cut

20
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,640
this split this clip we'd have to change

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,930
the speed twice but we see there's

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,850
information about the video the audio

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,460
some metadata and right up above it all

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,250
is this speed so we can change the speed

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,070
here if we change this to two it's going

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,920
to be 200% or two times the speed and

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,590
hit enter and then we see our clip it

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,630
gets sort and all of a sudden and it did

29
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,600
the audio and the video adjusted the

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,990
speed so it's playing very fast now we

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,280
can't see this the settings up here

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
because nothing is selected when we went

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
to play it D selected it for some reason

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,320
so we left click on it again and we can

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,270
see we can change it back to one and hit

36
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,670
enter put it back to where it was or we

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,190
can make it down to whatever we want so

38
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,530
we can do half speed would be 0.5 hit

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,170
enter and now it's half the speed so we

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,700
go back to the beginning or any point

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,050
and we play it

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,860
there's a cool song Jolene by Dolly

43
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,600
Parton it's awesome you should check it

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,210
out they slowed it down and it sounds

45
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,640
like I love listening to that song this

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,560
little motion version anyway this just

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,020
reminded me of that so yeah that's

48
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,000
basically adjusting speed what did I say

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,980
yeah this is basically it that's how you

50
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,720
do speed in clips and then if we were to

51
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,200
split this we can change the speed back

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,660
to one on this one but just be aware

53
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,970
that if we do that it's only on the

54
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,770
active clip so this will still be slow

55
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,449
motion and then it goes back normal

56
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,310
speed if we split it again and change

57
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,160
this one to three times the speed well

58
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,330
now we're gonna have slow regular and

59
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,040
then fast speed that's it basically I

60
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,120
guess I don't need to say any more

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
adjusting speed using shot good thanks

62
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,750
for watching catch you in the next video
