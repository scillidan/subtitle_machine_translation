00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,800
welcome back to another shotcut video

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,570
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,730
going to be looking at the green screen

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,690
chroma key feature and taking out a

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,089
certain color and then compositing it

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,609
over a different video so should be a

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,349
lot of fun what we're gonna do first is

8
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:21,599
click here and go to add video track and

9
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:23,220
then add video track we need to have two

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,550
tracks because we need a video for our

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,869
background I'm just going to choose this

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,749
one in this case so whatever's on this

13
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,070
lower track will appear in the

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,780
background and then whatever we place on

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,090
top of it so in this case it'll be our

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,130
clip with a green or blue screen or a

17
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,990
consistent color that we want to remove

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,860
and so what we'll do is take out this so

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,650
if we play it now we see that it's just

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,050
the green we're not seeing this

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,430
background like we want it we want to

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,620
see the jet of course but we don't want

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,790
to see this green we want it to be

24
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,010
transparent so to turn it transparent we

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,620
use the chroma key feature and basically

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,560
it's a filter so we add it as under

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,060
video and it's just chroma key there

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,069
simple and advanced we'll just start

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,560
with simple and we see that by default

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
since it's it was set up for this green

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,880
color we can choose a certain color so

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,250
this is what it might look like oh

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,020
actually we want to black either if we

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,909
choose a weird color that this doesn't

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,320
have then we kind of see what this

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,450
looked like originally and then we can

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,610
actually take this eyedropper and select

38
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,400
this green color to really help it look

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,620
more natural there's still a little bit

40
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,240
of green up here we can see it looks a

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,790
little bit strange but at least this

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,920
actually isn't too bad so the video

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,990
still playing in the background and then

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,729
we also have this jet just flying away

45
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,979
from the house super low to the ground

46
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,510
and then yeah that's that so I'm not too

47
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,370
bad and then if we want to we can bring

48
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,020
that in and see some of that green that

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,909
we don't really would like to adjust a

50
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,010
little bit we can adjust and fine-tune

51
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,170
here and see so that kind of makes that

52
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,869
all kind of green in we can adjust until

53
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,460
a lot of that green goes away but if we

54
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,770
go too far we start losing some of our

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,740
some clarity too so we just adjust there

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,900
and that looks pretty good

57
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,460
yeah not too bad though huh it helps

58
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,200
that my video clip if I go back to the

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,480
source it helps that these video clips

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
are the same size

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,130
I go to properties I see is 1920 by 1080

62
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,990
both of them are which makes it nice

63
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,760
otherwise that jet would be really small

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,190
and I would have to scale it first if it

65
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,600
were smaller than my source of it than

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,820
my the other video I was compositing it

67
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,190
against or vice versa so when doing

68
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,480
chroma key it's a good idea to always

69
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,370
have your your Clips be the same size

70
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,620
but it's not necessary I mean we can

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,480
always change it in fact what we could

72
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
do if we want this jet to be a little

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,290
bit smaller and just up here in the sky

74
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,440
we could now go to filters and apply a

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,270
size what do I do a size and position we

76
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,280
click on this go to filters go to add

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,090
and we type in size and position so now

78
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,340
we can actually take this and we can

79
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,890
resize it and it resizes it with the

80
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,750
green screen and we can kind of put it

81
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,870
up here I don't know if this is gonna

82
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,280
make anything because you didn't look

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
good or not let's go to the beginning of

84
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,060
see now we have the jet just sort of up

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,830
there slowly flying by this part of it

86
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,580
right there so you can do you know

87
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,910
multiple and a lot of times you will do

88
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,489
size and position and scale your green

89
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,800
screened object because you want it to

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,150
just be floating in the middle of your

91
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,000
of your video let's look at doing one

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,470
more well let's look at the advanced now

93
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,020
so I'm going to click on here and delete

94
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,910
and that gets rid of all the effects we

95
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,670
did too and then might as well just

96
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,010
since we're deleting anyway let's bring

97
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,340
in this is a cool one this door so let's

98
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,260
bring in this clip that I'm sure you're

99
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,989
not sick of yet and let's bring in this

100
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,560
one so what we're gonna do is have this

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,170
door open and we'll see hopefully

102
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,310
someone playing the banjo out on the

103
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,800
back porch but so we after this green is

104
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,230
a lot more pale and then that last one

105
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,550
we were looking at so let's see how this

106
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,830
works we go to filters we select the

107
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,709
clip with the door we go to add video

108
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,399
and we go to let's try now we'll just do

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,048
the advanced so we need to pick the

110
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,120
color so we'll grab our I draw

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,729
and tell it that that shade well look at

112
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,850
that pretty good so far so that's the

113
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,820
shade we want and then let's move this

114
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,610
video a little bit where is it at so we

115
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,790
go to size and position so let's move

116
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,440
this over a little bit here so we can Oh

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
wrong one control let's get rid of size

118
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,139
in position there let's come over here

119
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,040
and let's apply a size and position to

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,199
this background video so we go now we

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,750
can move this and have it be back here

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,690
this is my buddy Reef playing the banjo

123
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,720
alright so here we go not too bad

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,900
so this door gets opened and reached out

125
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,199
here larger-than-life playing banjo ok

126
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,820
we can make some adjustments on here now

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,470
so we come back to this one that has the

128
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,660
the chroma key and now we can make some

129
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,130
adjustments just like we did before on

130
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,110
this simple well now this basically has

131
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,699
some different ones that we can adjust

132
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,400
so we can do this one we don't want to

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,349
start getting rid of that door though so

134
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:29,880
we kind of make some changes here to get

135
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,410
rid of some of that green and some of

136
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,520
that weird-looking yeah just some

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,680
artifacting happening there so we don't

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,090
we again we don't want to go too much

139
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,630
and we digest we can apply some lighting

140
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,919
filters too to kind of match the

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,870
lighting since this is done in a studio

142
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,560
and this one's done out doors oh by the

143
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,180
way I should just mention both of these

144
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,260
clips I got from pixabay so there's some

145
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,240
different Clips you can get include the

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,410
link it's pixabay.com

147
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,760
and some great open source or very open

148
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,220
licensing for getting some nice video

149
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,490
clips if you need something to work with

150
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,990
oh and then you can change what also

151
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,250
other settings you're not exactly sure

152
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,620
what these do but see it changes the the

153
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,479
way this appears so play with some of

154
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,729
these settings and see that floor looks

155
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,139
a little bit strange it's all black

156
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,380
there so some of these we can change and

157
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,610
make it look a little bit more natural

158
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,530
and then this shape kind of just affects

159
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,849
I actually don't know exactly what it

160
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,919
does but it affects the way the green

161
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,990
screening works

162
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,470
we'll go back to the ellipse maybe there

163
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,850
you have it that is doing chroma key in

164
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,500
shot cut actually really not too bad at

165
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,830
all

166
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,320
this invert here actually inverts it the

167
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,390
other way around so now we're seeing the

168
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,860
base basically it's like switching these

169
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,930
two clips so now we're actually seeing

170
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,340
this part of the green screen

171
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,940
everything else is masked out but yeah

172
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,060
play with that and let me know if you

173
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,010
have any questions comments below this

174
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,260
might be the last shot cut video I do in

175
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,290
a little while but I'll keep adding to

176
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,630
as more projects come to mind just so

177
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,130
you know I have been using shot cut to

178
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,770
compile all of these video this video

179
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,920
tutorial series and there's been some

180
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,090
pluses and minuses you know if you've

181
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,990
been watching the last couple videos

182
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,180
we've had some crashes I'm haven't been

183
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,510
really impressed with the stability of

184
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,660
of shot cut but what I will say is the

185
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,040
rendering is very quick so it's actually

186
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,780
faster rendering when we go to export

187
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,060
our video the rendering is much quicker

188
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,520
than kdenlive it takes full advantage or

189
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,700
a lot more advantage of GPU and CPU

190
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,140
whereas for the time being kdenlive is

191
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,080
only cpu rendering at least without some

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,270
workarounds so I do like the rendering I

193
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,550
love the simplicity of the interface I

194
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,470
think for like your grandma this would

195
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,210
be the best open source program she can

196
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,430
use for video editing but when you do

197
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,080
get into the upper end of some of the

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
different effects transitions filters I

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,150
think you can want to go over towards

200
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,760
kdenlive or something like The DaVinci

201
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
Resolve if you want more you know some

202
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,230
of those more advanced features anyway I

203
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,790
really appreciate you sticking with me

204
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,890
