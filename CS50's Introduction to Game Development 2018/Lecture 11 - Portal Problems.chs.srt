2
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,470
科尔顿·奥格登：好的 
COLTON OGDEN: All right.

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,553
大家下午好 
Good afternoon, everybody.

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,490
非常感谢你来参加今天的演讲 
Thank you so much for coming to today's talk.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,510
我叫科尔顿·奥格登 
My name is Colton Ogden.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,730
我是GD50的课程讲师 它
I'm the course instructor for GD50, which

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,105
是中证50的S新推出的游戏开发入门课程 
is CS50's new Introduction to Game Development course.

8
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:28,980
我们是从去年春天开始的 我们每周都会讲课
We started this last spring and we've been having lectures every week

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,690
上个学期到目前为止 
so far for the last semester.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,790
上周 我们看了一下门户网站 它
Last week we took a look at Portal, which

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,240
是Valve的一个著名游戏 在这个游戏中 你可以得到一把枪 它基本上可以
is a famous game by Valve, whereby you get a gun that can essentially

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,460
拍摄这些无视空间法则的门户
shoot these portals that defy the laws of space

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,010
在游戏中使用不同的服务 
onto different services in the game.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,820
走进走出它们 通过它们传送和看穿它们 
Walk in and out of them and teleport through them and see through them.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,340
还有许多有趣的挑战与之相关
And there are a host of interesting challenges associated

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,798
实现这样一款游戏 
with implementing a game like this.

17
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,450
上周我们在《联合》杂志上看到了它的一个简单版本 
Now last week we looked at a simple version of it in Unity,

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,961
但今天我们请到了Valve Software的Dave Kircher和Tejeev Kohli 他们
but today we are joined by Dave Kircher and Tejeev Kohli of Valve Software who

19
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:57,960
实际上我们是门户团队的一员 并实施了
actually were on the Portal team and implemented

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,570
所有有趣的设计和技术决策
all of the interesting sort of design and technical decisions

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,270
那就是让它发挥作用 让它变得有趣和可信 
that went about making it work and making it fun and believable.

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,020
因此 没有任何进一步的麻烦 这就是“门户问题” 
So without any further ado, this is the "Portal Problems."

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,769
谢谢 
Thank you.

24
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,114
[掌声]
[APPLAUSE]

25
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,810
Tejeev Kohli：嗨 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Hi.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,960
所以我们只需要把它看完 
So we're just going to run through.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,850
当我们受雇于Valve时 我和Dave实际上都是学生 
Both me and Dave were actually students when we were hired by Valve,

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:29,630
我们受雇来重现我们作为学生项目为Valve所做的工作
and we were hired to recreate the work we did as a student project for Valve

29
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,480
对于门户1和门户2 
for Portal 1 and for Portal 2.

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,660
今天我们只想和你谈谈一些
And today we just wanted to talk to you about some

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,900
在我们试图创建门户的机械师时遇到的问题中 
of the issues we had trying to create the mechanic for portals,

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,380
然后还有一些设计 既有技术上的 也有一些设计上的
and then also some of the design, both the technical and some of the design

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:53,880
我们必须解决和解决的问题 才能使机械师正常工作 
issues that we had to tackle and work on to make the mechanic work properly.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,915
所以戴夫要开始了 然后我会加入进来 
So Dave is going to start off and then I'll jump in later.

35
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,670
戴夫·科尔彻：大家好 
DAVE KIRCHER: Hey, folks.

36
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,130
如他所说 我叫戴夫·基尔彻我是被录用的
As he mentioned, my name is Dave Kircher I was hired

37
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,960
专门为门户网站工作 
on specifically to work for Portal.

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,970
因此 我将继续并开始前言 
So I'm going to go ahead and preface.

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,060
我们今天跳过了很多话题 而且跳得很快 
We're jumping through a lot of topics today and jumping very quickly,

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,119
所以这是一个视频很多的演示文稿
so this is a very video heavy presentation

41
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,560
这样我们就可以快速地跳入和跳出 
so that we can jump quickly in and out.

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,260
如果我说得太快了 我很抱歉 
And I'm sorry if I go a little too fast.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,350
我在为流媒体做一些优化 
I'm kind of optimizing for the stream.

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,470
所以希望 如果我说得太快了 
So hopefully, if I have gone too quickly over something,

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,230
您可以查看该流并再次查看它 
you can review the stream and see it a second time.

46
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,280
因此 不要再费劲了 让我们开始吧--只是速度快点 
So without further ado, let's start off-- just quickly.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,620
我想在座的大多数人
I'm assuming that most of the people here

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,497
玩过门户游戏 或者至少在某种意义上熟悉它 
have played Portal or at least are familiar with it in some sense.

49
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:35,580
这只是一个假设 
That's just an assumption.

50
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,790
而且 至少在技术上 
And that, for at least the technical portions,

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,300
您至少对3D渲染比较熟悉 
that you are at least somewhat familiarized with 3D rendering.

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,300
如果你不是 你可能需要稍微学习一下 然后再回来 
If you're not, you may need to study up a little bit and then come back.

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,970
但让我们从什么是门户开始吧？
But let's start off with just what is a portal?

54
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,250
门户是3D空间中的不连续部分 
A portal is a discontinuity in 3D space.

55
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,080
这是一种2D不连续 我们基本上
It's a 2D discontinuity where we basically

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,210
在空间中的某个地方定义一个2D矩形 这样正面--对不起 
define a 2D rectangle somewhere in space such that the front face-- sorry,

57
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,960
2D矩形的背面被定义为另一个2D矩形的正面
the back face of the 2D rectangle is defined as the front face of another 2D

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,260
矩形 
rectangle.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,252
我这里有一个简单的蓝色门户的小例子
So I've got my simple little example here of this blue portal

60
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:05,210
还有这个橙色的入口 
and this orange portal.

61
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,420
我们将他们定义为背靠背 这就得到了这个结果 
We're defining them to be back to back, which gets us this result over here.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,887
所以从这个门户网站的小家伙的角度来看 
So from the perspective of this little portal guy,

63
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,720
它应该看起来像是另一个房间 里面有一个立方体 
it should look like there's another room attached with a cube in it.

64
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,197
但我们实际上并没有移动3D空间
But we're not actually moving 3D space at all

65
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,030
因为不然的话 我们试图确保这个观点是
because otherwise we're trying to make sure that this perspective is

66
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,920
对这家伙和魔方来说都是真的 
true for both this guy and the cube.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,919
然后你就会有这个奇怪的重叠空间
And then you'd have this weird overlapping space

68
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,670
这对任何人来说都没有任何意义 
that doesn't make any sense to anybody.

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,130
所以我们做了很多破解 让它看起来像是太空
So we do a lot of hacks to make it seem like space

70
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,930
是以这种有趣的方式折叠 而不是真正移动空间 
is folding in these interesting ways without actually moving space.

71
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,510
另一种想法是 它是一扇门 
Another way to think of it is that it's a door.

72
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,690
如果你仔细看这扇门 它是一扇非常标准的门 
If you look closely at this doorway, it's a very standard door.

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,760
这是一扇门 就像你走进去一样 不同的事情发生了 
It's a door like you walk through it, different stuff happens.

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,900
但我一开始没有告诉你的是 这实际上不是一扇门 
But what I'm not telling you initially is that this actually isn't a door.

75
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,540
出于技术原因 此级别需要此处的门户
For technical reasons, this level required a portal here

76
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,120
因为我们需要这个房间来搬家 
because we needed this room to move.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,000
因此 尽管它看起来像一个门口 但它完全是假的 
So even though it looks like a doorway, it's completely fake.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,190
这是一扇门 它实际上带着你
And that it's a doorway that actually takes you

79
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,300
横跨水平线大约半英里 
about a half mile across the level.

80
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,090
但它看起来像一扇门 所以我在门户系列中的工作
But it looks like a door, and so my job on the Portal series

81
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,080
是为了确保当我们创建门户时 他们
was to make sure that when we're creating portals that they

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
对于球员来说 感觉就像是一个门口 
feel to the player like a doorway.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,390
如果你从门口的角度来考虑它们 
And if you think of them in terms of a doorway,

84
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,600
传送门的所有有趣的东西都发生在门口的内侧
all the interesting stuff for a portal happens on the inside of the doorway

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,089
外面也没有什么有趣的事情发生 
and nothing interesting happens on the outside.

86
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,797
我的工作就是确保所有有趣的事情
And it's my job to make sure that all the interesting things that

87
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:22,280
发生在门外的事情不会发生 
are happening outside the door don't happen.

88
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,101
因为这些都是没有任何意义的东西 
Because that's all stuff that doesn't make any sense.

89
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,100
如你所见 我刚刚飞过了那一层 
So as you can see, I just flew across the level.

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,320
这就是我们刚才看到的门的另一边 
And that's the other side of that door that we just looked at.

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,270
我正穿过它 它是一扇门 
And I'm walking through it and it's a doorway.

92
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,250
所以这是一扇不需要你几英寸的门 
So it's a door that doesn't take you a couple of inches.

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,249
它带你穿过平地大约半英里 
It takes you about a half mile across the level.

94
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,110
现在我们进入渲染部分 该部分
Now we're into our rendering section, which

95
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,207
基本上是我在门户领域的主要专长之一 
is basically one of my main expertises in the portal area.

96
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,290
所以我们将会谈论很多事情
So we're going be talking about quite a few things

97
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,650
我很快就会跳进去 所以希望我
and I'm going to jump in quickly, so hopefully I

98
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,940
不要吐得太快 
don't spew it out too quickly.

99
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,920
这就是我的问题 
That's kind of my problem.

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,610
因此 呈现视图门户主要有两个层 
So there are primarily two layers to render a portal of view.

101
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,500
可能还有更多 但这是我主要熟悉的两个 
There might be more, but these are the two that I am primarily familiar with.

102
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,200
我们使用Narbacular Drop的初步方法是
The preliminary way that we did it with Narbacular Drop, which

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,280
是具有渲染纹理的门户的前身 
was the predecessor to Portal was with rendered texture.

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,682
然后 当我们开始制作门户专营权时 
And then when we got to working on the Portal franchise,

105
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,390
我们切换到了一种方法 在那里你可以画出它
we switched to a method where you draw it

106
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,848
使用所谓的模板缓冲区 所有操作只需一次即可完成
all in a single pass using what's known as a stencil buffer

107
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,230
稍后我会更多地谈到这一点 
and I'll be talking more about that in a bit.

108
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,600
但每种方法都有权衡之处 
But there are tradeoffs to each method.

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,460
因此 对于纹理 每个门户视图都必须有单独的纹理 
So with a texture, you have to have separate textures per portal view.

110
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,260
如果您支持递归 那么您可以
And if you have support for recursion, you

111
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,676
必须预先分配许多纹理才能执行此操作 
have to have many, many textures pre-allocated to do this.

112
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,570
所以你的内存增长得非常快 
So your memory growth gets big very fast.

113
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,270
你必须使用画家的算法或类似的东西
You have to use the Painter's Algorithm or something like it

114
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,130
来渲染您的门户 
to render your portals.

115
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,470
你基本上要找出你最深的入口
You basically have to figure out the deepest portal you

116
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,681
可以先看到并渲染那个 
can see into and render that one first.

117
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,430
然后 任何外在的东西 你都是
And then any outward ones from that you're

118
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,510
去渲染它们 因为它们将
going to render them because they're going

119
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,610
以包含第一个门户的视图 
to contain a view of that first portal.

120
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,500
所以你必须按照这个顺序来呈现它 
So you have to render it in that order.

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,240
我不知道这是不是真的了 
And I don't know if it's true anymore.

122
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,300
这绝对是我最初在第一个门户网站上工作的时候 
It definitely was when I originally was working on the first portal.

123
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,670
你不能有效地使用抗锯齿 
That you couldn't effectively use anti-aliasing,

124
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,391
因此 当您靠近门户时 您会看到小的视觉制品
so you get small visual artifacts as you get close to a portal

125
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,890
因为它会被渲染为一种纹理 而不是
because it would be rendered as a texture that doesn't quite

126
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,730
渲染方式与后台缓冲区的其余部分相同 
render the same way as the rest of the back buffer.

127
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,837
但它是实现起来最简单的 尤其是
But it is the simplest to implement, especially

128
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,420
如果您根本不支持递归 
if you don't support recursion at all.

129
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,450
这非常简单 因为你可以忽略画家的算法
It is super simple to do because you can ignore the Painter's Algorithm

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,080
只需将它们全部呈现在您的主视图中 
and just render all of them before you of your main view.

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
相比之下 当您使用模具进行渲染时 
By contrast, when you render with stencils,

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,340
它将整个帧呈现到后台缓冲区
it renders the entire frame to the back buffer

133
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,673
因此 您没有任何额外的纹理内存要求 
so you don't have any extra texture memory requirements.

134
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,600
你一次就完成了所有的任务 
You're doing it all in a single pass.

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,510
你正在从你的主要观点出发 并以你的方式进入 
You're starting from your main view and working your way in.

136
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,234
你实际上必须把它嵌套一点 所以这很有趣 
You actually have to nest it a little bit, so it's interesting.

137
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,400
您可以保证获得相同的视觉质量
You are guaranteed to get homogeneous visual quality

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,570
因为这是一次传球 
because it's a single pass.

139
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,450
渲染帧其余部分的方式 
The way you're rendering the rest of your frame.

140
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,200
但是当你渲染它们时 它有很多额外的复杂性
But it has a lot of extra complexity of when you render them

141
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,840
以及如何呈现它们 
and how you render them.

142
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,640
因此 该渲染部分将需要
So this rendering portion is going to require

143
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,390
有相当多的空间思维 
quite a bit of spatial thinking.

144
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,970
所以我要给你们看这个视频 
So I'm going to show you this video.

145
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,590
基本上 这是我将多次使用的布局 
Basically this is a layout I'm going to use a couple of times.

146
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,320
这个可以玩吗？
Does this play?

147
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,280
希望--好的 好的 
Hopefully-- yes, OK.

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,860
这是一个房间布局 我将使用几次
This is a room layout that I'm going to use a couple of times

149
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,990
我有一个橙色的入口和一个蓝色的入口 
where I've got an orange portal and a blue portal.

150
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,650
每一面墙的后面都有一堵薄墙 后面有一些东西 
And behind each one is a thin wall with some stuff behind it.

151
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,460
但希望能帮助说明蓝色门户前的情况 
But hopefully to help illustrate what's in front of the blue portal,

152
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,520
你可以看到那里有一大堆蓝色的东西 
you can see there's a whole bunch of blue stuff over there.

153
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,890
是的 这就是我希望你们记住的示例布局
So yes, that is the example layout I want you to kind of keep in your head

154
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,451
因为空间思维很重要 实际上是有参考价值的 
because spatial thinking is important to actually have reference.

155
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,700
让这件事再结束一次 
Let this finish one more time.

156
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,650
好的 
OK.

157
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,550
这是与使用纹理进行渲染相关的内容
Now this is something that pertains to both rendering with textures

158
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,550
和模板 我要让它播放一次
and stencils and I'm going to let this play once

159
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,650
因为有人建议我 如果我的前置负荷太大 
because I was advised that if I front load this too much,

160
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,490
这听起来令人困惑 
it sounds confusing.

161
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,865
所以当我播放这个的时候 我想让你们看看事实
So while I'm playing this, I want you to look at the fact

162
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,010
当橙色入口出现在屏幕上 或者没有出现时 
that when the orange portal is on screen and when it's not,

163
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,260
橙色椭圆形的里面的所有东西
everything inside where the orange oval is

164
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,320
当它存在和不存在时 看起来完全相同 
looks exactly the same for when it is and when it is not there.

165
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,980
所以我在这里所做的就是在两个视图之间切换
And so what I'm doing here is as I'm toggling between the views

166
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,410
我正在传送到虚拟摄像机所在的位置 
is I am teleporting to where the virtual camera is.

167
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,070
这是从橙色入口渲染出来的 
That's rendering out of the orange portal.

168
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,665
哎呀--来吧 倒回去 
Whoops-- come on, go back.

169
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:06,480
哦 上帝 
Oh, God.

170
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,924
好的 
OK.

171
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,090
我在来回切换 
I'm toggling back and forth.

172
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,881
我在看橙色的入口 但我
I'm looking into the orange portal, but I'm

173
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:14,519
切换到虚拟摄像机位于蓝色门户后面的位置 
toggling to where the virtual camera is behind the blue portal.

174
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,560
所以如果你还记得我说过我们
So if you remember back to when I said that we're

175
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,780
将一个矩形的背面定义为
defining the back face of one rectangle to be

176
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,910
另一个矩形的正面 即
the front face of another rectangle, that

177
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,100
意味着它们在任何时候都应该是共面的 
means that they should be coplanar at all times.

178
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,720
所以如果你从我的球员模型角度来看
And so if you think of my player model in terms

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,790
把它送到橙色的入口 
of walking it to the orange portal.

180
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,809
当我渲染我的出口视图时 我应该在蓝色门户后面结束
When I'm rendering my exit view, I should end up behind the blue portal

181
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,070
因为我正在用它来渲染 
as I'm rendering out of it.

182
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,060
所以重要的是要记住 所有的角度都是从那里继承下来的 
So it's important to remember that all the angles carry over from that.

183
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,059
最重要的是 无论是渲染纹理还是渲染
And most importantly that whether you're rendering textures or rendering

184
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,690
模版里面的一切都不会移动
to stencil that nothing inside ever moves

185
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,850
因为它应该是完全相同的视角 
because it should be the exact same view angles,

186
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,725
像素应该位于完全相同的位置 
the pixels should be in the exact same place.

187
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:52,260
如果它们不在同一个地方 那么你的数学就错了 
If they're not in the same place, your math is wrong.

188
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,801
在使用纹理渲染时 这一点尤其重要
And this is especially important when rendering with textures

189
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,480
因为我见过的几个人犯的第一个错误之一
because one of the first mistakes I've seen several people do

190
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,900
它们将整个屏幕渲染成一种纹理 
is that they render the entire screen to a texture.

191
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,790
然后他们将整个纹理映射到这里的这个小二次
And then they map the entire texture to this little quadratic here

192
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,760
它看起来很奇怪 取决于你离得多近或多远 
and it looks all weird depending on how close or far away you are.

193
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,030
但只要你投射出--
But as long as you project the--

194
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,190
抱歉的 
sorry.

195
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,260
尝试使用视频并不是最容易的 
Trying to work with videos is not the easiest.

196
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,860
所以只要你把网格的顶点投射到哪里
So as long as you project where the vertices of your mesh

197
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,840
在屏幕空间中 您可以重复使用这些坐标作为纹理坐标
are in screen space, you can reuse those coordinates as your texture coordinates

198
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,797
然后它就会完美地排成一排 
and then it will line up perfectly.

199
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:32,130
这就是为什么它以一对一的方式呈现的原因 
So that's the point of why it's rendering as one-to-one.

200
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,755
您只需要确保渲染的部分相同
You just want to make sure that you're rendering the same parts

201
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,120
移动到屏幕的同一部分 
to the same part of the screen.

202
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,287
现在我说我会用以前的布局
Now I said I'd be using that previous layout a bunch

203
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,078
我发誓我会回到那里的 
and I swear I'm going to get back to there.

204
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:43,800
但对于使用模板进行渲染 这是一个更好的布局 
But this is a much better layout for rendering with stencils,

205
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,299
因此 现在你需要学习一个新的布局 只需一分钟 
and so now you need to learn a new layout just for a minute.

206
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,425
它只在模具中使用 
It's only used in stencils.

207
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:49,632
但我让这两个入口互相对视 
But I've got these two portals looking at each other.

208
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,750
它们有点--一个堆叠在另一个的上面 
They're kind of-- one stacked on top of the other,

209
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,970
他们有这些轻便的桥梁
and they've got these light bridges that are just

210
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,960
用来向你展示透明胶片是一种特殊情况 
serving to show you that transparencies are kind of a special case.

211
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,720
所以我要再放一次 
So I'm going to play it one more time.

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,636
所以你只有两个面对面的入口 
So you just got two portals facing each other.

213
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:03,210
即使它们很小 它也会产生无限的递归
And even though they're tiny, it does make an infinite recursion down

214
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,990
进入入口 
into the portals.

215
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,500
所以用模板来渲染 
So rendering with stencils.

216
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,290
我在某种程度上假设在演讲的这一部分
I'm kind of assuming that for this part of the talk

217
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,830
你对什么是深度缓冲有所了解 
that you have some idea what a depth buffer is.

218
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,900
如果你不这样做 你可能需要好好读一读 
You may need to read up on that if you don't.

219
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,600
模具缓冲区与深度缓冲区非常相似
The stencil buffer is very similar to the depth buffer

220
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,330
因为它定义了规则和操作 当我们可以批发时 
in that it defines rules and operations for when we can wholesale just not

221
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,130
画一个像素或者当我们想画它的时候 
draw a pixel or when we do want to draw it.

222
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,810
当我们画像素的时候 
And then also while we are drawing pixels,

223
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,950
你可以定义几个如何修改深度缓冲区的操作 
you can define several operations of how to modify the depth buffer.

224
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,680
但实际上 它对用户是不可见的
But for all intents and purposes, it's invisible to the user

225
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,430
除了最后的结果 模板缓冲区 很像深度缓冲区 
except for the end result. So stencil buffer, a lot like a depth buffer,

226
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:48,870
但是你是在代码中控制值而不是通过顶点深度 
but you're controlling the values in code instead of by vertex depth.

227
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,770
所以在我们使用stenchmark渲染任何场景之前 我们要做的是
So before we render any scene using stencils, what we're going to do

228
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,290
我们要同时清空模板缓冲区
is we're going to clear our stencil buffer at the same time

229
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,498
当我们清除深度缓冲区时 
as we clear our depth buffer.

230
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,320
我们要把它清零 
We're going to clear it to all zero values.

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,190
我们在传送门1中使用的模板缓冲区
And the stencil buffer we were working with with Portal 1--

232
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,990
我相信它只有两个比特 
I believe it only had two bits.

233
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,750
我可能错了 
I could be wrong.

234
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,125
它可能高达8位 但它不是很多位 
It might be up to eight bits, but it's not a lot of bits.

235
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,162
因此 我们需要非常保守地对待我们在那里输入的值 
So we need to be very conservative with the values we put in there.

236
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,620
所以我们要把它清零 
So we're going to clear it to zero.

237
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,590
所以里面的一切都是零 
So everything in it is zero.

238
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,400
然后我们将渲染场景中的所有OPEC对象
And then we're going to render all of the OPEC objects in our scene

239
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,840
这就是我给你们看的画面
and that's where we get to the visual I'm showing you here.

240
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,214
所以你会注意到这里没有一座光桥 
So you'll notice that none of the light bridges are here.

241
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,660
这里没有那些很酷的花哨的橱窗 
None of the cool fancy window stuff is here.

242
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,390
所以我们所做的就是画出所有不透明的物体 
So all we've done is draw in all the opaque objects.

243
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,020
然后我们绕了一个特殊的弯路来渲染一个入口 
And then we take a special detour to render a portal.

244
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,430
在这一点上 我们已经在这里渲染了这个椭圆 
At this point, we've rendered this oval here.

245
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,990
当我们绘制椭圆形的时候 我们告诉渲染系统
And while we're rendering the oval, we tell the rendering system

246
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,220
在渲染像素的任何地方递增模板缓冲区 
to increment the stencil buffer wherever we render a pixel.

247
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,420
所以当我们渲染的时候 所有的像素都从0到1
So while we're rendering, all of the pixels here go from 0 to 1

248
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,370
这一点很重要
and that's an important bit.

249
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,780
所以我们可以用它来判断深度
So we're going to be able to use that to tell the depth--

250
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,940
告诉绘制操作从那时起在哪里绘制 
to tell draw operations where to draw from then on.

251
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,110
一旦我们画出模板缓冲区的增量 
And then as soon as we've drawn the incrementing of the stencil buffer,

252
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,882
我们告诉所有的绘制操作从那时起只绘制
we tell all draw operations from then on to only draw

253
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:03,090
其中 模具值为1 
where the stencil value is 1.

254
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,673
我们告诉它不要修改任何东西 
And we tell it to not modify anything.

255
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,780
我们只画有1的地方 
We're only drawing where there's a 1.

256
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,630
然后我们基本上就可以完全忘记模板缓冲区了
And then we can basically just forget all about stencil buffers

257
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,582
再画一会儿 然后继续画 
for a little bit and keep drawing.

258
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,540
但在这一点上 如果你一直在跟踪深度缓冲区 
But at this point if you've been following along with the depth buffer,

259
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,510
我们已经在大门后面画了这面漂亮的小墙 
we've already drawn this nice little wall behind the portal.

260
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,432
所以深度和这里的这个小四边形一样 
So the depth is the same as this little quad here.

261
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:25,390
所以我们要做的第一件事就是渲染一个有深度的全屏幕四边形
And so the first thing we do is we render a full screen quad with depth

262
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,980
在最大值下 这真的很有效
at maximum value, which does really effectively

263
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,560
在这一点上把这个弄成一个洞 
make this a hole at this point.

264
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,518
如果我们继续绘制不透明的物体和类似的东西 
And if we were to continue drawing opaque objects and things like that,

265
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,760
他们就会出现在这个洞里 
they would just show up in this hole.

266
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,490
然后我们开始--
So then we start--

267
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,220
在我们抽签之后 在我们把洞打得很深之后
after we have drawn, after we have punched our hole in depth

268
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,060
我们要求所有的绘制操作都有这样的匹配
and we've required that all draw operations have this matching

269
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,140
模板值为1 那么我们所做的就是从我们的主要场景重新开始
stencil value of 1, then what we do is we just start over in our main scene

270
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,490
再画一次 再画一次 
again and just draw it again.

271
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,855
但这一次 我们移动了虚拟相机 
But this time we move our virtual camera.

272
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,230
就像我在渲染中展示的操作一样 
Just the same operation as I showed you in the rendering.

273
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,500
这是一对一的 我们只需要做一个矩阵变换
It's one-to-one, we just have to do a matrix transform such

274
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,530
我们在蓝色入口的后面 我们又画了一次 
that we're behind the blue portal and we draw it again.

275
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,130
所以 让我们看看这个 
And so, let's see here.

276
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,460
我想我有一个放大镜 
I think I have a magnifying glass.

277
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,216
所以你可能注意到了 我们在--
So you may notice that we're in--

278
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:09,840
哎呀 
whoops.

279
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,619
好吧 我显然不能变焦和使用激光笔 
OK, I can't apparently zoom and use a laser pointer.

280
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,660
所以你可能会注意到玩家模型在那里 
So you may notice that the player model is there,

281
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,240
然后是我之前展示给你们的完全相同的设置 
and then the exact same setup as I had shown you before.

282
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,859
这是同样的一套四边形和椭圆形 
It's the same set of quads and the oval again.

283
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,400
我们再做一次完全一样的事情 
And we do the exact same thing again.

284
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,730
我们告诉它递增 所以这个小椭圆形中的所有值
We tell it to increment so all the values in this tiny little oval

285
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,320
以下是现在的2个 
here are now 2.

286
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,257
然后在这一点上 我们告诉 好的 只呈现模板值为2的像素
And then at that point we tell, OK, only render pixels with a stencil value of 2

287
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,340
然后我们可以再次忽略模具缓冲区 
and then we can just ignore stencil buffers again.

288
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,710
我们再打一次洞 然后再递归一次 
We punch the hole again, and then we recurse again.

289
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,860
我们得到的值是3 
And we go into a value of 3.

290
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,154
在这一点上 
At this point--

291
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,070
稍后我将对其进行更详细的介绍 
I'm going to get more into detail on it later,

292
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,405
但是我们停止递归地呈现到模具缓冲区
but we stop recursively rendering to stencil buffers

293
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,530
因为不然的话 我们会画一大堆场景
because otherwise we'd draw a whole bunch of scenes

294
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,300
我们不会真的看到 
that we're not going to actually see.

295
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,360
我们耍了个小把戏 我就要上当了 
We pull a little trick that I'm going to get into.

296
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,850
所以 当我们画出所有的不透明区域时 理论上我们会绕道而行 
So as we've drawn all of our opaques, we would theoretically do our detour.

297
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,830
我们没有 
We don't.

298
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,630
然后我们画出我们所有的半透明物体作为结束 
And then we finish by drawing all of our translucent objects.

299
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,100
我知道在那里看到它们是很小的 
And I know it's very tiny to see them there,

300
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,550
但这一点稍后会变得更加明显 
but it will become more apparent later.

301
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,967
我认为--抱歉 这实际上是我们的渲染技巧 
I think that-- sorry, that's actually our rendering trick.

302
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,716
在那里 现在我们实际上已经在该视图中绘制了半透明 
And there, now we've actually drawn the translucence in that view.

303
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,990
我知道这很小 但在递归级别1会更有意义 
And I know this is very small, but it'll make more sense at recursion level 1.

304
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,823
因此 当我们绘制半透明对象时 我们
So as we draw our translucent objects, we're

305
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,360
仍然仅限于模板值为2的绘图 
still all confined to drawing where stencil value is 2.

306
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,410
然后一旦我们画完了所有的半透明物体 
And then once we are done drawing all of our translucent objects,

307
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,120
我们将门户呈现为椭圆形--
we render the portal oval--

308
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,720
哎呀 对不起 对不起 
whoops, sorry, sorry.

309
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,540
我要假装我们要画到大椭圆形
I'm going to pretend that we're drawing to the big oval

310
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,800
在这里 因为它更容易看到 
here because it's easier to see.

311
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,750
我们会在这个高度画另一个四边形 有点像窗户 
We would draw another quad at this level, sort of like a window,

312
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,597
告诉它将模板值递减回1 
telling it to decrement the stencil value back to 1.

313
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,180
对不起 我需要退后一步 
I'm sorry, I need to take a step back.

314
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,630
我们需要更换深度 这样那里就不再有洞了 
We need to replace depth so that there's no longer a hole there.

315
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,440
因此 我们绘制全屏四边形 深度等于入口平面
So we draw the full screen quad with depth equal to the portal plane

316
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,560
同时仍然限于嵌套视图 然后我们递减 
while still restricting to the nested view and then we decrement.

317
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,370
抱歉的 
Sorry.

318
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,160
所以 当我们完成减量的时候 
So by the time we've done decrementing, that

319
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,600
意味着第一次递归中的所有像素现在再次为1 
means all of these pixels inside this first recursion are now 1 again.

320
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,180
它们中的每一个都是模具值上的1 
Every single one of them is a 1 on the stencil value.

321
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,514
因此 我们可以从第一次递归开始继续渲染半透明
So we can continue rendering the translucence from the first recursion

322
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,430
就像我们做不透明的时候一样 
just like we did when we're doing the opaques.

323
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,550
我们可以说 只要把你的画限制在所有模板值1 
We can say just restrict your drawing to all stencil value 1.

324
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,300
然后我们在那里完成我们的半透明 
And then we finish our translucence there.

325
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,660
当我们回到主视图时 我们再次做同样的事情 
We do the exact same thing again while we're going back to the main view.

326
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,329
我们固定我们的深度 然后我们再次减小模板的值 
We fix up our depth and then we decrement the stencil values again.

327
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,120
然后我们就完成了我们的主要场景 
And then we just finish out our main scene,

328
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,860
现在 您已经使用模板绘制了门户 
and now you have portals drawn using stencils.

329
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,970
它们不需要任何额外的纹理内存 
They required no extra texture memory whatsoever.

330
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,060
所以回到我们曾经有过的场景
So bouncing back to the scene that we had

331
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,020
在此之前 我们必须迅速解决的一件事
shown before this, one of the things that we had to solve pretty quickly

332
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,584
就是当你在门户中间有一些物体时 
is when you have some object in the middle of a portal,

333
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,750
你必须能够同时在两个地方看到它 
you have to be able to see it in two places at once.

334
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,150
我们做到这一点的方法是 我们只需抬头看
And the way that we do this is we literally just look up

335
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,010
每一块和渲染几何体 
every piece and rendering geometry.

336
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,940
它使用每一种纹理 复制并传送每一帧
It uses every texture and replicate it and teleport it every single frame

337
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,040
无论原作在哪里 
to wherever the original is.

338
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,860
当我们复制的时候 这个物体在这里 
And while we're replicating, this object over here.

339
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,010
你可以看到它在橙色入口的前面稍微多一点 
You can see that it's slightly more in front of the orange portal.

340
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,070
因此 规则基本上是这样定义的 即无论哪个对象--
So basically the rules are defined such that whichever object--

341
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,530
对象的哪一侧的原点在门户前面
whichever side of the object has its origin in front of the portal

342
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,460
才是主宰 
is the master.

343
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,980
这个立方体的原点就在它的中间 
And the origin for this cube is right in its middle,

344
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,510
而原点只是我们用来定义空间中一点的一个术语
and origin is just a term that we use to define the one point in space that

345
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,259
定义此对象的位置 
defines where this object is.

346
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,050
所以通常它在一个物体的中心 
So usually it's in the center of an object.

347
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,350
并不总是这样 但这意味着这是真的 
Not always, but that means this is the real one.

348
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,080
这是我们的全套和彻头彻尾的假的
And this is our complete and utter fake one

349
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,700
我们必须为每一个穿透入口的物体做这件事 
that we have to do for every single object that is penetrating the portal.

350
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,620
现在 当我们复制几何体时 我们是否
Now when we duplicate geometry and whether we

351
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,650
不--无论我们是否复制 我们都有另一个问题要解决 
not-- whether we duplicate or not, we have another problem to solve.

352
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,025
我要让这段视频播放 
I'm going to let this video play.

353
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:47,360
我要时断时续地切换一个破碎的部分 
I'm going to be toggling a broken part on and off.

354
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,690
因此 当立方体不在墙后时 这是固定的版本 
So when the cube is not behind the wall, that's the fixed version.

355
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,630
当你可以在墙后看到它时 那就是破碎的版本 
And when you can see it behind the wall, that's the broken version.

356
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,110
因此 如果你考虑复制几何图形 
So if you think about replicating geometry,

357
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,260
我们已经将整个模型复制到这个橙色门户 
we have replicated the entire model to this orange portal.

358
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,367
这意味着所有应该做的事情
Which means all the stuff that is supposed

359
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:06,200
站在蓝色门户前面 也就是坚守在这堵墙后面 
to be in front of the blue portal is also sticking behind this wall.

360
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,940
因为我们又一次定义了这两个面是共面的 
Because once again, we have defined the two faces to be coplanar.

361
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,996
所以我们要做的就是使用所谓的剪切面
So what we have to do is we have to use what's known as a clip plane

362
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,829
告诉渲染系统 你知道吗？
to tell the rendering system, you know what?

363
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,869
如果网格在这半个空间的这一半上 不要画任何像素 
Just don't draw any pixels if the mesh is on this half of this half space.

364
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,640
我们将半空间定义为入口平面 
And we define the half space to be the portal plane.

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,390
我们可以打开和关闭这个剪裁平面
And we can turn this clip plane on and off

366
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,400
当我们在入口平面内绘制对象时
as we're drawing objects inside the portal plane

367
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,369
这就是它发挥作用的原因 
and that's what makes it work.

368
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,290
否则 它将扼杀整个世界 
Otherwise it would clip the whole world.

369
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,110
我要再放一次录像带 
I'm going to play the video again.

370
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,742
常有的事 
It happens.

371
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,450
所以 是的 我们只是在说 嘿 你
So, yeah, we're just telling it, hey, you

372
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,740
只需忽略所有空间的一半上的每一个像素 
need to just ignore every single pixel that's on that half of all of space.

373
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,034
不要画它们 
Don't draw them.

374
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,950
这让它看起来不像是
And that makes it so it doesn't seem like it's

375
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,170
以一种人们不理解的奇怪方式从后面露出来 
sticking out the back in weird ways that people don't understand.

376
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,200
好的 现在这是一个非常相似的概念 
OK, now this is a very similar concept.

377
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,080
一种我们创造了术语“香蕉汁”的东西 
Something that we coined the term "banana juice" for.

378
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,040
甚至回到纳巴卡拉 因为这太让人困惑了 
Even back in Narbacular Drop because it's just confusing.

379
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,960
我知道你在问自己 “香蕉汁”到底是什么？
And I know you're asking yourself, what in the heck is "banana juice?"

380
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,260
这没有任何意义 
That doesn't make any sense.

381
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,270
所以我们决定用一个完全疯狂的词来形容它 
So we decided to use a completely insane term for it.

382
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,450
因为即使是我们描述问题的技术速记
Because even our technical shorthand for describing the problem

383
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,270
没有准确地描述它是什么 
didn't accurately describe what it was.

384
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,790
所以我们决定用一个术语--
So we decided to use a term that--

385
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,320
很明显 需要做出解释 
it was obvious that explanation was needed.

386
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,050
所以我们现在看到的是我拿着我的橙色相机
So what we've got here is I've got my orange camera

387
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,381
我正看着这里的橙色入口 
and I'm looking into the orange portal here.

388
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,880
这意味着我有我的蓝色摄像头 虚拟摄像头 
And that means I've got my blue camera, virtual camera here,

389
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,340
从蓝色的传送门往外看 
looking out of the blue portal.

390
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,290
如果你还记得我的例子 我们已经
And if you remember back to my example, we've

391
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,690
这是蓝色入口后面的几何图形 
got this geometry that's behind the blue portal.

392
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,200
它在蓝色虚拟摄像机和入口之间 
And it's between the blue virtual camera and the portal,

393
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,410
如果我们渲染它 它会看起来完全坏了 
and if we render that, it's going to look completely broken.

394
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,280
所以“香蕉汁”是一个术语 用来定义这种碎东西
So "banana juice" is a term to define this broken stuff

395
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,370
如果你往薄墙后面看 你就会看到 
that you would see if you were looking behind the thin wall.

396
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,100
我这里有一段视频 
And I have a video of it here.

397
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,980
我相信我在视图之间来回切换 就像当
I believe I'm toggling back and forth between views just like when

398
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,060
我向你展示了一对一的渲染 
I showed you rendering as one-to-one.

399
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,860
这是我关掉剪切机的照片 
And that's me turning off the clip plane.

400
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,026
这就是如果我们在虚拟空间和剪辑中的样子
This is what it would look like if we were in the virtual space and the clip

401
00:18:57,026 --> 00:19:00,700
飞机没有启用 然后我回到我们的主视图 
planes were not enabled and then I go back to our main view.

402
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,030
你会看到 当我在一秒钟内走动时 它看起来完全坏了
And you'll see as I move around in a second that it looks completely broken

403
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,870
如果你不明白发生了什么 这会让你的大脑崩溃 
and it kind of breaks your brain if you don't understand what's going on.

404
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,770
所以这就是“香蕉汁” 你用完全相同的方法来修复它
So that is "banana juice," and you fix it exactly the same way

405
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,110
与实体剪裁一样 
as with the entity clipping.

406
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,600
你有剪辑模型 但我们要做的是 我要在这里重播视频 
You have clip models, but what we do is I'm going to replay the video here.

407
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,370
如果你正在观看 这一关卡的整个部分现在都被剪裁了 
If you're watching, this entire part of the level is now clipped.

408
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,760
所以我们要做的是 当我们渲染一个虚拟摄像机时 
So what we do is while we're rendering a virtual camera,

409
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,851
我们只需在传送门平面后面剪掉整个世界 
we just clip the entire world behind the portal plane.

410
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:32,350
所有的一切 
All of it.

411
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,382
后面的一切 
Everything that's back there.

412
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,090
所以这也是你修复“香蕉汁”的方法 
So that's how you fix "banana juice" too.

413
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,090
一旦你理解了 就不是很难了 
It's not super difficult once you understand it,

414
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,140
但我可以告诉你 我花了大约两天时间
but I can tell you it took me about two days

415
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,848
弄清楚我第一次看到它的时候到底发生了什么 
to figure out exactly what was going on when I originally saw it.

416
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:46,010
这完全说不通 
It just didn't make any sense.

417
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,150
所以再来看一遍 我知道我们跳了很多 我很抱歉 
So moving on again, I know we're jumping a lot and I'm sorry.

418
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,580
我们只会继续以快节奏前进 
We're just going to keep moving on at a quick pace.

419
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,299
所以无限递归是人们所期待的东西
So infinite recursion is something that people kind of expected

420
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,840
看看他们什么时候在玩传送门 
to see when they were playing portal.

421
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,839
如果你曾经演奏过最初的纳巴卡勒空降 
If you ever played the original Narbacular Drop,

422
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,090
我们不支持任何形式的递归 这有点令人失望 
we didn't support any form of recursion and it was kind of a letdown.

423
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,470
因此 我将深入探讨这是如何工作的 
So I'm going to go into how this works.

424
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,910
在这个视图中 您可以看到我们有一个蓝色的门户 
So in this view, you can see that we have this blue portal.

425
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,810
这是我们在这里的第一次递归 它占据了屏幕的大部分 
That's our first recursion right here and it's taking up most of the screen.

426
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,230
然后我们有一个蓝色的入口 你可以看到它的整体 
And then we've got this blue portal that you can see the entirety of it.

427
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,150
这是我们的第二次递归 
That's our second recursion.

428
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,170
而这里的这张完全是假的 
And this one in here is completely and totally fake.

429
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,170
所以那一个 那里无论如何都没有入口 
So that one, there is no portal there whatsoever.

430
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,500
我们所做的就是把我们看到的一切
What we're doing is we're taking whatever we see

431
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,570
这个门户的第二次递归 
of this portal, the second recursion.

432
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,720
我们采用的是上一帧中的完全相同的观点 
We're taking that exact view from the previous frame.

433
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,470
我们获取这些像素 然后我们基本上是在做一个修复
We're taking those pixels and then we're basically doing a fix up

434
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,600
以防你移动你的相机 
in case you moved your camera around.

435
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,000
我们正在应用来自第二个门户的纹理坐标
And we're applying the texture coordinates from the second portal

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,070
第三个传送门应该在哪里 
to where the third portal would be.

437
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,000
说到完全假的 我的意思是我们甚至没有绘制这个蓝色的椭圆形 
And by a completely fake, I mean we didn't even render this blue oval.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,310
这只是这个椭圆形的复制品 
That's just a copy of this oval right here.

439
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,890
所以这就像你把摄像机对准视频监视器一样
So it's the exact same thing as if you point a video camera at a video monitor

440
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,600
这是在显示它正在录制的内容 
that's showing what it's recording.

441
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,290
你得到了反馈循环 
You get that feedback loop.

442
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,665
但我们可以接触到一些额外的特殊数学知识 
But we have access to a little bit of extra special math.

443
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:04,623
这意味着我们不会有那种奇怪的蛇
That means that we don't get that weird snaking

444
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,380
如果你来回移动它 就会产生效果 
effect if you move it back and forth.

445
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,620
我们可以很快把它修好 
We can fix it up quickly.

446
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,229
但这段视频实际上将向你展示这一点是如何迅速分解的 
But this video is actually going to show you about how this quickly breaks down.

447
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,020
因为如果你有先见之明 你可能
Because if you're thinking ahead, you might

448
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,680
想知道如果你看不到所有的第二个入口会发生什么 
be wondering what happens if you can't see all the second portal.

449
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,620
答案是我们把它拉长 
And the answer is that we stretch it.

450
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,610
所以当你看第三部的时候 它会以一种奇怪的方式伸展开来 
So as you watch the third one, it just kind of stretches off in weird ways.

451
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,892
这是一个问题 如果我们花很多时间 
Which is a problem that, if we spend a bunch of time,

452
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,100
我们本可以修好的 
we probably could have fixed.

453
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,600
但在游戏开发中 有时你只是说它足够好
But in game development, sometimes you just call it good enough

454
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,660
然后继续前进 因为我打赌任何玩过原版门户的人都不会
and move on because I bet anybody that played the original Portal never

455
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,096
注意到了这一点 
noticed this whatsoever.

456
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,434
[笑]
[LAUGHING]

457
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,830
所以它的另一个细分 我个人觉得既恼人又有趣
So another breakdown of it, which I find personally annoying and interesting

458
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,570
在同一时间 
at the same time.

459
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,519
我只想先把它的视频放出来 
I'm just going to show the video of it first.

460
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,560
当我走的时候 你会注意到第三次递归 这是完全
As I'm walking, you'll notice at the third recursion, which is completely

461
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
假的 你会看到一个流行音乐 
fake, you're going to see a pop.

462
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,860
你会看到 每次我走过一个传送门 它都会跳出来 
You're going to see every single time I walk through a portal, it pops around.

463
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,610
所以这实际上很容易解释 一旦你理解了--
So this is actually fairly easy to explain once you understand--

464
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,950
真正了解黑客是如何工作的 
really understand how the hack works.

465
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,530
所以 如果你看我的视觉化 这是
So if you look at my visualization here, this

466
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,840
是实际递归的样子 如果我们真的这样做了 
is what the actual recursion would look like if we actually did it.

467
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,040
所以我们在这些蓝线上有几个入口 
So we've got a couple of portals here at these blue lines.

468
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,130
所以在我们的第一个入口里面 我们离它很近 
And so inside our first portal that we're fairly close to,

469
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,590
我们的视野真的很广 
our field of view is really wide.

470
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,970
然后 当我们到达我们的第二个入口时 它变得非常窄 非常快 
And then as we get to our second portal, it gets really narrow really fast.

471
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,220
但当我们到达第三个地方时 它就变得更窄了 
But then as we get to the third, it narrows even more.

472
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,260
然后第四个 它变得更窄了 
And then the fourth, it narrows even more.

473
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,110
但是因为我们是剪切和粘贴 所以第二次递归 
But since we're cutting and pasting, the second recursion,

474
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,260
如果你往下看这张图 这就是黑客 
if you look down here on this visualization, this is the hack.

475
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,701
所以我们拿这个 第二个可视化的 然后复制
So we take this one, the second visualization, and copy

476
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:36,700
然后把它粘贴到第三个和第四个上 
and paste it onto the third and onto the fourth.

477
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,680
你可以注意到 这根本不收敛 
And you can notice that this doesn't converge at all.

478
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,610
它不会缩小范围 
It doesn't narrow.

479
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,400
所以我们看到了同样数量的围墙
So we're seeing the same amount of wall around each

480
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,050
不管什么情况 不管这个洋红锥体有多窄 
of the recursions no matter what, no matter how narrow this magenta cone is.

481
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,620
所以当我们穿过传送门时 洋红锥体 
So as we walk through a portal, the magenta cone,

482
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,110
我们选择了一个更远的入口 因为现在
we're picking a portal that's further off because now

483
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,568
这是我们穿过门户之后的第二次递归 
that's the second recursion after we walk through a portal.

484
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,760
所以它开始的范围很窄 更接近于
So it starts off narrow, which is closer to what

485
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,920
它应该看起来是无穷大的 
it should look like at infinity.

486
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,070
它应该会缩小到你所看到的蓝色管子的位置 
It should narrow to basically where you're seeing a blue tube.

487
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,626
但是当我们走得越来越近的时候 
But then as we walk closer and closer to the main portal,

488
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,500
然后它会变宽 变宽 变宽 
then it's going to widen and widen and widen.

489
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,702
所以只有一声砰的一声 它就会突然就位 
And so there's just a pop where it snaps into place.

490
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:18,910
因此 希望这是有意义的 
So hopefully that made sense.

491
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,250
再一次 完全改变话题 因为我们
And once again, completely changing topics because we

492
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,560
有那么多东西要讲 
got so many things to cover.

493
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,280
因此 当我们呈现门户时 我们必须
So when we're rendering portals, we have to have

494
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,470
第一人称和第三人称的混合呈现 
a mix of rendering first person and third person.

495
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,700
所以在这种情况下 你可以看到我的第三人称模型在这里
So in this case, you can see I've got my third-person model over here

496
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,750
通过这个入口 
through this portal.

497
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,580
另一个第三人称模特在这里 
Another third person model over here.

498
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,880
然后我们在主视图中看不到它 因为我即将打开它 
And then we don't see it in the main view because I'm about to turn it on.

499
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,870
如果你在主视图中看到第三人称视图 它看起来会非常奇怪 
It would look really weird if you saw the third-person view in the main view.

500
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,570
嗯 
Yeah.

501
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,620
我的意思是 一些游戏确实试图用非常特殊的表现来解决这个问题 
I mean, some games do try to fix this with very special representations.

502
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,640
他们会试着只画腿或类似的东西 
They'll try to draw just the legs or something like that.

503
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,360
但是 是的 所以我们必须有一个复杂的系统
But, yes, so we have to have a complicated system

504
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,200
弄清楚什么时候画第三人称 什么时候画第一人称 
to figure out when to draw third person and when to draw first person.

505
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,320
如果你猜的话 我打赌你会说 嗯 只是
And if you were to guess, I bet you would say, well, just

506
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,020
每次通过门户查看时都渲染第三人 
render a third person every time you look through a portal.

507
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,940
事实证明 情况要比这稍微复杂一些 
And it turns out it's slightly more complicated than that.

508
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,960
我不会真的进入复杂的版本 
I'm not actually going to get into the complicated version,

509
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,668
但我要向你展示它是如何破碎的
but I'm going to show you how it's broken

510
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:16,420
如果你使用这个简单的规则 为什么生活会很容易
if you use that simple rule because why would life be easy

511
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,295
我们恰好可以在
and we would just be able to render just when

512
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,380
我们在传送门的另一边 
we're on the other side of a portal.

513
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,640
所以在这种情况下--
So in this case--

514
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,280
让我抬起头来 
let me look up.

515
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,090
所以你会注意到 在这种情况下 我是倾斜的 
So you'll notice in this case, I'm on a tilted angle.

516
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,710
这是一个我的脚在传送门一侧的情况
And this is a case where my feet are on one side of the portal

517
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,710
我的眼睛在传送门的另一边 
and my eyes are on the other side of the portal.

518
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,960
所以它在某种程度上打破了原来的系统
So it kind of breaks the original system that

519
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,830
会说 哦 如果你在门户的另一边 只需渲染即可 
would say, oh, just render if you're on the other side of a portal.

520
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,079
所以 是的 这有点复杂 
And so, yeah, it's a little more complicated.

521
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:38,620
不是很严重 
Not terribly.

522
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,703
实际上 它看起来应该比这更破碎 
It should actually look way more broken than this,

523
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:42,649
但我们实际上在几个地方找到了解决办法 
but we actually had the fix in several places.

524
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,440
这是一个特殊的建筑 我不得不回到过去 打破东西
And this is a special build where I had to go back and break things

525
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,030
只在一个地方把它弄断了 
and only broken it in one place.

526
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,560
好的 好的 
Yeah, OK.

527
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,430
然后是渲染部分的最后一个 
And then the last on our rendering portion.

528
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,680
所以早些时候我谈到了我们需要如何复制
So earlier I had talked about how we need to duplicate

529
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,235
位于入口中间的几何图形 
geometry that is mid-portal.

530
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:01,610
但还有一件事我们需要复制 
But there's also another thing that we need to duplicate,

531
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,050
有哪些屏幕空间会影响我们可以查询的位置
which there are screen space affects where we can query

532
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,940
绘制运算之类的东西 
draw operations and things like that.

533
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,320
因此 我们使用屏幕空间中的这些绘制操作的一种方式
And so one way that we use these draw operations that are in screen space

534
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,850
是为了确定在这些灯周围使用多少光眩光 
is to determine how much light glare to use around these lights.

535
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,130
所以这些是如何工作的 基本上我们画了一个四边形
And so how these work are basically we draw a quad

536
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,420
当我们在拉灯的时候 
while we're drawing the light.

537
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,904
然后我们说 好的 在几帧中
And then we say, OK, in a couple of frames

538
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:27,070
我要你告诉我实际绘制了多少像素 
I want you to tell me how many pixels actually drew.

539
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,320
因为管道的关系 我们不能直接查询
And we're not allowed to actually query this immediately because of pipeline

540
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,820
原因
reasons.

541
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,086
我们还没有几帧的结果 
We don't have the results for several frames.

542
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,960
所以我们得把那个写着
So we have to cache off that handle that says

543
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,125
你画了多少像素 我们稍后会得到结果 
how many pixels did you draw and we'll get the result at some point later.

544
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,750
有时候你很幸运 只有一帧 但通常是两帧
Sometimes you're lucky and it's just one frame, but usually two

545
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,015
或者三帧--你得保存一段时间 
or three frames-- you have to save it for a while.

546
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:44,890
但你可能注意到了 
But you may notice that even though we're not

547
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,820
复制光的几何形状 我们画了两个
replicating the geometry of the light, we're drawing two of them

548
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,210
因为它们在屏幕上
because they're in screen space.

549
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,380
这意味着这个查询系统必须很聪明
So that means that this query system had to be smart about it

550
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,340
我将展示两个不同的结果 
and I'm going to show how we have two separate results.

551
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,490
如果我们用的是最初写的引擎 
Now if we had used the engine as it was originally written,

552
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,380
对于一个灯只有一个查询 
there would be just one query for one light.

553
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,410
但那就意味着这些灯会同时变暗 
But then that would mean that these lights would dim in unison.

554
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,370
因此 我们需要为每个门户视图提供单独的存储桶 
So we need to have separate buckets for each view of portals.

555
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,200
每个浏览者查询这个入口
And every view query that portal--

556
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,190
在该递归中发出的任何视图查询 
any view query that is issued while in that recursion,

557
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,670
我们必须把它放在一个完全独立的桶里 然后再把它叫回来 
we have to keep it in a totally separate bucket and call it back later.

558
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,070
当我们穿过传送门时 我们必须转移那些桶 
And then as we walk through portals, we have to transfer those buckets.

559
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,360
所以如果我现在走进蓝色入口 
So if I were to walk into the blue portal at this point, all of those

560
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,250
我们必须转移到主视图的句柄 
handles we have to transfer to the main view.

561
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,610
然后我们把主视图中的所有图像转换成现在的图像
And then all the ones that are from the main view we transfer into what was now

562
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,985
橙色的 因为我们会走出这个橙色的 
orange because we would be walking out of this orange one

563
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:35,260
如果我们走进蓝色 
if we walked into the blue.

564
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,340
所以 是的 这就是我想介绍的快速渲染 
So, yeah, that is the quick set of rendering things I wanted to cover.

565
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,610
现在我把它交给我的同事Tejeev
So now I'm going to hand it off to my colleague, Tejeev,

566
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,190
谈谈设计 
to talk a bit about design.

567
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,308
让你的空间思维休息一下 
Give your spatial thinking a bit of a rest.

568
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:48,286
[笑]
[CHUCKLES]

569
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,450
TEJEEV KOHLI：所以这是很多技术性的东西
TEJEEV KOHLI: So that was a lot of technical stuff

570
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,810
关于传送门的渲染 
about rendering of portals.

571
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,020
你可以看到它比一开始看起来更复杂 
And you can see it's more complex than it seems at first.

572
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,130
天真的解决方案似乎是我们会让你大部分的方式 
The naive solution seems like we'll get you most of the way there,

573
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,250
但是当你开始在游戏中加入更多的东西和更多的方式
but then as you start putting in more things in the game and more ways

574
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,139
玩游戏 与游戏互动 
to play a game, to interact with the game,

575
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,180
你看 有一堆不同的复杂性
you see there's a bunch of different complexities

576
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,060
这一点你必须解释清楚 
that you have to account for.

577
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,580
这些复杂性中的许多不仅仅是在技术上的 
And a lot of those complexities are not just in a technical sense,

578
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,770
但也是从设计的角度来看 
but also from a design sense.

579
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,440
所以我只想谈谈其中一些问题
So I just want to talk through some of the issues

580
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,460
这是我们在制作门户1和门户2时想出来的 以及一些方法
that we came up with as we were making Portal 1 and 2 and some of the ways

581
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,179
我们试图解决这些问题 
we tried to solve them.

582
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,970
我想提的第一件事是
One of the first things I wanted to mention

583
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,740
是在第一次提出门户的想法时 
was when first coming up with the idea for portals,

584
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,210
在弄清楚我们是否应该花一大堆时间
before figuring out if we should spend a bunch of time

585
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:45,400
想出这个点子 这个大多数人都没见过的新游戏机械师 
making this idea, this new game mechanic that most people haven't seen before.

586
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,920
我们所做的是--
What we did was--

587
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,930
戴夫和他的团队制作了门户的原型
Dave and his team made a prototype of Portal

588
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:00,710
在他们还是学生的时候 DigiPen使用的2D游戏引擎 
in a 2D game engine that is used in DigiPen while they were students.

589
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,390
它是内部制造的DigiPen 2D引擎 
And it was made in-house DigiPen 2D engine.

590
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,810
你可以在这里看到它是门户网站的2D版本 
And you can see here that it's a 2D version of Portal,

591
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:14,200
但它仍然拥有门户网站中使用的所有基本游戏机制 
but it's still got all the basic game mechanics that are used in Portal.

592
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,510
这样做的主要目的是为了查清机制
And the main goal of doing something like this is to vet out the mechanics

593
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,980
看看他们的核心是不是仍然有趣 
and see if they're still fun at their core.

594
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,070
你在这里做的一部分就是你的游戏测试 对吗？
And part of what you do here is you playtest, right?

595
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,890
你制作这个简单的原型 你就会得到
You make this simple prototype, and you get

596
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,710
其他人试着玩 然后说 嘿 这很有趣吗？
other people to try it out and play it and say, hey, is this fun?

597
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,240
这是我们下一年应该做的事情吗？
Is this something that we should spend our next year working on

598
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,092
作为一款真正的3D游戏？
as a proper 3D game?

599
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,800
你可以看到的原型具有大多数基本功能
And the prototype you can see had most of the basic functionality

600
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:50,840
在那里 某种程度上审查了机械师的想法 以推动它的发展 
there and kind of vetted out the idea of the mechanics to take it forward.

601
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,360
当我们把机械学向前推进时 一个
And as we take the mechanics forward, one

602
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,120
你首先意识到的一件事是
of the first things that you realize is this

603
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,760
是一种全新的机械师 人们并不真正了解
is a brand new mechanic that people don't really understand

604
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,080
你有一辆火车来训练他们 
and you have a train them.

605
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,397
向他们传授机械师的工作原理 还有
Train them with how the mechanic works and also

606
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:06,230
用足够的知识培训他们 这样他们
train them with sufficient knowledge so they

607
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,310
可以使用那个机械师来解决谜题 这是游戏的核心 
can use that mechanic to solve puzzles, which is the core of the game.

608
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,060
我们做的其中一件事是你有
And one of the things that we did is you have

609
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,390
让游戏中的某些部分
to have certain sections of the game where

610
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,470
你可以肯定的是 球员知道他们需要进步 
you can be sure that the player has the knowledge that they need to progress.

611
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,670
所以这很大程度上是为了确保你正在设计的关卡
So a lot of this is about making sure that the levels you're designing

612
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,330
以这样的方式完成 当玩家完成该关卡时 
are done in such a way that when the player finishes that level,

613
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,330
他们拥有你想让他们拥有的知识 
they have that knowledge that you want them to have.

614
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,060
而我们确保这一点的方法之一是通过做大量的游戏测试 
And one of the ways we ensure that is through doing a lot of play testing,

615
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,810
游戏测试是我将在演讲中更多讨论的内容
and play testing is something I'll talk about a little more as the talk goes

616
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,990
在……上面 
on.

617
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,847
但游戏测试的基本理念只是
But the basic idea of play testing is just

618
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,430
让别人来玩这个游戏 
getting someone else to play the game.

619
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,138
其他人可能是你的同事
And that someone else could be a coworker

620
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:54,920
他坐在你旁边 你的朋友--
who sits next to you, your friend--

621
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,050
其他任何人 真的 
anyone else really.

622
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,320
你特意从公司外找来玩游戏的人 
Someone you get especially to come play the game from outside the company,

623
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,560
但通常只有你的同事 坐在你旁边的人 
but usually it's just your coworkers, people that sit next to you.

624
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,460
看到你在游戏上工作但不知道你到底在做什么的人 
People that see you work on the game but don't know exactly what you're doing.

625
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,250
你可以观察他们 看看他们在做什么 
And you can observe them and see what they're doing,

626
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,490
从他们那里获得一些反馈 然后使用这些数据
get some feedback from them, and then use that data

627
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,390
然后重复机械师的话 
and iterate on the mechanic.

628
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:21,680
你可以在这里看到 这是门户1的一个关卡 
And you can see here, this was a level in Portal 1.

629
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,250
这是相当早的时候 这个水平 你可以看到这里的门户 
It was pretty early on, this level, and you could see the portals here.

630
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,070
这里的蓝色入口正在计时器上移动 
The blue portal here is moving on a timer.

631
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,740
它从一个移动到下一个再到下一个 
It moves from one to the next to the next.

632
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,170
这个水平的想法是 当玩家解决这个问题时 
And the idea of this level was by the time players solve this,

633
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,980
他们明白 我从一个入口进去 从另一个入口出来 
they understand that I go in one portal and come out the other.

634
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,430
这就是这里的基本理念 
That's the basic idea here.

635
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,970
而在门户1中 这一关卡在教授玩家这方面做得相当好 
And in Portal 1, this level did a pretty good job of teaching players that.

636
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,650
对于门户2 我们有一个非常相似的谜题 
For Portal 2, we have a very similar puzzle.

637
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,750
我只想试着在这里打球 
I'm going to just try and play here.

638
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,280
这是一个非常相似的谜题 
It's a pretty similar puzzle.

639
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,440
这个想法是一样的 
The idea is the same thing.

640
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,260
您有三个门户可以访问的部分 
You have the three sections that the portal can go.

641
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,839
我们在这里所做的一项更改是将门户从计时器移走
The one change we made here was we move the portal away from a timer

642
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,880
然后把它移到一个按钮上 
and moved it to a button.

643
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,240
这样玩家就能更好地控制传送门的开启位置 
So this way the player has more control of where the portals are opening.

644
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,110
这有几个原因 
There are a few reasons for this.

645
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,970
这里主要的一个是像在门户2的水平有更多的视觉噪音 
The main one here is like the level in Portal 2 has a lot more visual noise.

646
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,210
还有很多更像...
There's a lot more like--

647
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,870
这是一个旧的水平 很多树叶 很多破坏的东西 
it's an old level, a lot of foliage, a lot of destroyed stuff.

648
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,590
所以它不像传送门1那么干净 
So it's not as clean as Portal 1.

649
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,860
还有一个传送门2的例子
And also, there's a case of Portal 2, there's

650
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,980
很多已经玩过传送门1的人
a lot of people that have already played Portal 1

651
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,620
并且可能已经熟悉了机械 
and are probably already familiar with the mechanics.

652
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,770
所以我们不想让他们通过计时器
So we don't want them to have to go through the timers

653
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,960
等着所有的事情发生 即使他们知道它是如何工作的 
and wait for all the things to happen, even though they know how it works.

654
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,080
这样他们就可以直接进去给我们看
So this way they can just go in and show us

655
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,180
他们知道传送门是如何工作的
that they know how the portals work without having

656
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,090
等完所有的计时器
to wait through all the timers.

657
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,170
基本目标是一样的 
And the basic goal is the same thing.

658
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,582
在这一关结束时 我们相信玩家们会明白
That by the end of this level, we're confident that the players understand

659
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:52,290
门户网站是如何运作的
how portals work.

660
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,190
你通过游戏测试学到的另一件事
One of the other things that you learn through play testing

661
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,390
就是你学会了你需要教给玩家的东西 
is you learn what you need to teach the player.

662
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,680
有时候你在制作游戏的时候
There's sometimes when you'll be making the game

663
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,010
作为一个设计师或者创作者 
and there's certain things that you as a designer or as a creator

664
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,540
不会认为是具有挑战性的概念 或者是需要
won't think are challenging concepts or are things that need

665
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,240
明确地与玩家交谈 
to be talked to players explicitly.

666
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,910
我们很早就注意到
One of those things that we noticed early on

667
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:23,550
很多玩家认为
is this concept here where a lot of players kind of thought portals

668
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,810
是一种方式 
were one way.

669
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,290
从一个进去从另一个出来就这样 
That you go in one and you come out the other and that's it.

670
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,645
但他们必须被教导 你实际上可以走两条路 
But they have to be taught that you can actually go in both ways.

671
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,770
你可以穿蓝色的衣服出来穿橙色的 
You can go in the blue one and come out the orange,

672
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,200
或者你可以从橙色的盒子里进去 然后从蓝色的盒子里出来
or you can go in the orange one and come out the blue one.

673
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,925
所以这个拼图就是这么做的 蓝色的
And so this puzzle specifically does that, where the blue one

674
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,300
是唯一会动的
is the only one that'd be moving.

675
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,220
橙色的保持不动 
The orange one stays stationary.

676
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,550
你先从蓝色的那个进去 然后从橙色的那个出来 再换掉蓝色的 
First you go in the blue one, you come out the orange one, replace the blue,

677
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,310
然后你从橙色的盒子里进去 再从蓝色的盒子里出来 
and then you go in the orange one and come out the blue one.

678
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,890
这个想法是你必须通过游戏测试来计算
The idea with this again is you have to figure through play testing

679
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,580
就是你如何分辨不同的事物
is how you figure out the different things.

680
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,110
你需要教玩家的不同的离散的小事情 
The different discrete small things that you need to teach the player.

681
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,750
同时也想办法教他们
And also try to figure out how to teach them in a way

682
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,210
是他们自己想出来的而不是你告诉他们的
where they're figuring it out instead of you telling it to them.

683
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,316
所以在传送门1和2中 
So for the most part in Portal 1 and 2, there's

684
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:14,940
我们告诉玩家的一些事情 
certain things that we tell the player.

685
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,880
但在大多数情况下 我们希望他们能理解 
But for the most part we want them to figure it

686
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,280
出来自己顿悟
out and have that epiphany themselves.

687
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,170
因为这样他们才真正学会了 
Because then they really learn it.

688
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,860
如果你只是告诉他们 他们可能不会接受确切的知识 
If you just tell it to them, they might not take in the exact knowledge.

689
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,340
另一件事是 这是《传送门2》中的一个关卡 
Another thing here is this was a level in Portal 2,

690
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,570
但我们通过一个游戏测试注意到--
but we noticed through one of our play tests--

691
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,980
我看了一些我们的比赛测试 
I looked through a few of our play tests that players were super

692
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,520
犹豫着要不要把传送门放在地板上
hesitant to place portals on the floor.

693
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,000
尽管这个级别可能是游戏中的第五或第六个 
Even though this level is probably the fifth or sixth one in the game,

694
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,580
在此之前的游戏中你已经这样做过几次了
and you've done that a few times in the game before this.

695
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,670
但通常你都是在下面做
But usually you are doing it way down there

696
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:57,510
做一个飞行机械师 你穿过入口飞出来 
and doing a fling mechanic where you fly through the portal and come out.

697
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,180
所以玩家们以前把传送门放在地板上 
So players have placed portal on the floor before,

698
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,270
但他们并没有在自己的脚边做 
but they haven't done it right at their feet.

699
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,790
所以我们必须设计一个方案 唯一的出路--
So we had to design a scenario here where the only way forward--

700
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,090
你被困在这间黑屋子里一无所有
you're trapped in this black room with nothing else

701
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,260
你唯一能做的就是在地板上放一个传送门
and the only thing you can do is place a portal on the floor there.

702
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,300
这是你在不断测试的过程中意识到的事情之一 
And that's one of the things that you realize as you keep testing.

703
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,147
你会遇到不同技术水平的球员
You'll come across players of different skill levels

704
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:23,730
不同的电子游戏知识和不同的知识
and different knowledge of video games and different knowledge

705
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,330
控制是如何工作的 
of how controls work.

706
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,070
通常你要确保你不仅仅是在提供餐饮服务
And typically you want to make sure that you're not only catering

707
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,850
到低端或高端 
to the low end or the high end.

708
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,080
你要确保他们两个都能在你的游戏中玩得开心 
You want to make sure that both of them can have a good time with your game.

709
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,870
所以你想设计一种不太打扰人的益智游戏 
So you want to design puzzle games in a way that aren't super intrusive.

710
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,960
如果一个球员看到这个已经到了这里
If a player that sees this get here already

711
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,473
我知道我可以把传送门放在地板上 然后经过 
knows that I can place portals on floor and go by.

712
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:47,639
这看起来不像是什么能阻止他的 
This doesn't seem like anything that's stopping him.

713
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,290
这看起来只是水平的一部分 
This just seems like part of the level.

714
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,080
但对于一个来到这里的新玩家来说
But to a new player that comes in here and is

715
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,920
就像我不知道该怎么做一样 他们需要一段时间才能弄明白 
like I don't know how to proceed, it takes them a while to figure it out.

716
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,260
然后 当他们有了灵光一现的时刻 他们就会觉得很聪明 
And then when they have that aha moment, they feel pretty smart about it.

717
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,860
所以你想确保你设计的东西
So you want to make sure that you're designing stuff

718
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:07,000
在某种程度上 这并不会让已经了解机制的玩家感到沮丧 
in a way that isn't frustrating players that already understand the mechanics,

719
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,780
但也不是让不了解机制的球员有
but also isn't making players that don't understand the mechanics have

720
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,310
也会感到超级沮丧 
to be super frustrated as well.

721
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,870
我们不得不做的另一件事是--
Another thing that we had to do--

722
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:27,680
传送门1和2都有这样的机械师 你可以进入地板上的传送门
Portal 1 and 2 both have this mechanic where you go into a portal on the floor

723
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,220
从墙上出来 它会保持你的动量和速度
and come out one on the wall and it keeps your momentum and velocity

724
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,290
然后把你往前推 
and flings you forward.

725
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,520
当我们在研究这个机械师时 我们注意到了一件事
One of the things we noticed while we were working on this mechanic

726
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,680
很多时候球员并不是完全排成一队
is that there's a lot of times when players don't exactly quite line up

727
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,690
当他们从传送门掉下来的时候 
as they're falling through the portal.

728
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,570
这意味着当他们坠入时 他们将会翻身--
Which means that when they fall in, they're going to fall out--

729
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,860
他们不会以正确的方式从墙上的传送门出来 
they're not going to come out of the portal on the wall in the correct way.

730
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,950
很多时候 玩家不知道他们有正确的解决方案 
And a lot of times players won't know that they had the right solution,

731
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,440
他们只是把执行过程搞砸了一点 
they just kind of messed up the execution a little bit.

732
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,680
我们想试着帮助这些案例中的玩家 
And we want to try and help the players in these cases,

733
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,950
但还是要尽量不要干涉这件事 
but again try to be not intrusive about it.

734
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,170
因为你想确保球员们--
Because you want to make sure that the players--

735
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,620
当他们在解谜的时候 他们不会思考
as they're solving puzzles, they're not thinking

736
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,060
他们有正确的解决方案 但我第一次尝试时并没有奏效 
that they had the right solution but it didn't work the first time I tried it.

737
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,060
所以现在我不得不重新考虑整个解决方案 尽管解决方案是
So now I have to rethink the whole solution even though the solution was

738
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,419
第一次改正 
correct the first time.

739
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:23,960
所以我们使用的其中一个东西--我们使用了一些不同的东西
So one of the things we used-- we used a few different things

740
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,890
以这种方式帮助球员 
to help the players out in this way.

741
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,650
同样 他们的想法是玩家几乎看不见他们 
And again, with the idea of them being mostly invisible to the player.

742
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,410
它们并不总是完全看不见的 在某些情况下
They're not always completely invisible and in some cases

743
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,690
我们有办法选择退出它们 
we have ways to opt out of them.

744
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,670
但这是我们用过的东西之一 
But this is one of the things that we used.

745
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,700
所以如果你注意到这里 玩家会去
So if you notice here, the player's going

746
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,730
穿过橙色的传送门 
to drop through the orange portal.

747
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,160
但正如你注意到的 当我走过的时候--
But as you notice as I walk through--

748
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,660
往前走 我故意不会完全笔直地掉下去 
walk forward here, I'm purposely not going to fall exactly straight.

749
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,570
我们在游戏中的机械师之一是--
And one of the mechanics we had in the game was--

750
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,499
这是相当微妙的 但我会再来一次 
it was pretty subtle there, but I'm going to do it again.

751
00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:00,290
你会看到我走到一边 游戏就像漏斗一样把你
You'll see I'm walking to the side and the game kind of funnels you

752
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,640
进入传送门 
into the portal.

753
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,770
所以我们有我们在门户中使用的特殊东西 用于门户
So we had the special thing we used in portals, for portals

754
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,980
大部分是朝上放在地板上的 
that are on the floor facing mostly up.

755
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,710
想象有一个圆锥体从传送门出来 
Imagine there's a cone coming out of the portal,

756
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,100
如果你从某个高度坠落 如果你
and if you're falling from some height and if you're

757
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,640
在那个圆锥体和这个圆锥体内--
within that cone and the cone--

758
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,710
它不是超宽的 
it's not super wide.

759
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,090
它很窄 
It's pretty narrow.

760
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,490
如果你在那个圆锥体里 那么我们
If you're within that cone, then we kind of

761
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,680
把你引到传送门的中央 
funnel you into the center of the portal.

762
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,513
所以当你走出它的时候 你是
So that when you're coming out of it, you're

763
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,330
会和它完美地排成一排 
going to be lined up perfectly with it.

764
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,280
正如你所看到的 我第三次在那里做的时候 它没有发生 
And as you can see, the third time I did it there, it didn't happen.

765
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,830
因为它的工作方式是它只
Because the way this works is that it only

766
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,450
如果你在看传送门的话 这很管用 
works if you're looking at a portal.

767
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,780
所以它第二次起作用了 但第三次我
So it works the second time, but the third time I'm

768
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,480
大体上都是朝同一个方向前进 这是行不通的 
going to go mostly in the same direction and it's not going to work.

769
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,130
所以这就是我们试图让这些东西成为非侵入性的方式 
So that's our way of trying to make these things be non-intrusive.

770
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,626
如果玩家不希望进入那个门户 它就不会起作用 
To where if players don't expect to go in that portal, it's not going to work.

771
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,500
但如果玩家正在寻找一个门户 他们希望进入其中 
But if the player is looking at a portal and they expect to go in it,

772
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,240
我们有点像是在推动他们前进 
we kind of nudge them along a little bit.

773
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,634
你可以在这里看到 这是第二个案例
And you can see it here, and this is a second case

774
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,550
同样的东西 地板和天花板上都有一个入口 
of the same thing where there's a portal on the floor and the ceiling.

775
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,710
你可以看到漏斗在工作 
And you can see as the funnel is working,

776
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,750
这出戏恰如其分地处于中心位置 
the play is perfectly in the center of it.

777
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,499
但我会往前看一看 关闭漏斗 
But I'm going to look forward a little bit and disable the funnel.

778
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,574
你可以看到玩家会偏离轴心
And you can see the player's going to go off axis

779
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:16,490
因为漏斗被禁用了 球员慢慢地走出了漏斗 
because the funnels are disabled and the player slowly went out of it.

780
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,630
是啊 漏斗现在失灵了 
Yeah, the funnel is disabled now.

781
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,280
再说一次 这个想法是为了减少玩家的挫折感
And again, the idea of this is to reduce a bunch of the player frustration

782
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,940
以减少玩家得到的一大堆假阴性 
and to reduce a bunch of the false negatives that players get.

783
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,300
你想确保那些认为他们有解决方案的玩家 
You want to make sure that players that think they've got the solution,

784
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,490
如果这是正确的解决方案 你想
and if it was the correct solution, you want

785
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,700
想帮他们一点忙 
to kind of help them out a little bit.

786
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,325
你不需要为他们解开谜题 
You don't to solve the puzzle for them.

787
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:42,770
你不会想给他们 比如 这就是答案 
You don't want to give them, like, here's the answer.

788
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,978
但你确实想试着帮他们一点忙
But you do want to try and help them out a little bit

789
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:48,140
因为这有助于让游戏更有趣一些
because that helps that makes the game a little bit more fun

790
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,942
并减少挫折感 
and reduces the frustration.

791
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,960
这就是我们在进入传送门时得到的帮助 
So that was the help that we had for when you're entering portals.

792
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,630
我们也有相反的东西 那就是在1号门户 
We also have the opposite and that was there in Portal 1.

793
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,380
在门户2中 我们介绍了一些
And in Portal 2, we introduced something that

794
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,000
是帮手的对立面 当你走出大门时 我们会用到帮手 
was the opposite of a helper, which we used when you're coming out of portals.

795
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,750
所以2号传送门有一名机械师 叫空中信仰牌 
So Portal 2 had this mechanic called Aerial Faith Plates,

796
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,950
这很简单 
which is pretty straightforward.

797
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,110
你踩上这个信念盘子 它就会把你推向空中 
You step on this faith plate and it propels you to the air.

798
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,660
关卡设计者可以将信仰牌放在关卡上
And the level designers can place the faith plate on a level

799
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,960
可以控制弧线的轨迹
and can kind of control the trajectory of the arc

800
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,650
玩家将飞向何处 
of where the player is going to fly.

801
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,690
而这条弧线对玩家来说并不是真正可见的 
And this arc is not really visible to the player,

802
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,730
但根据关卡的设计 这是相当明显的 
but it's pretty apparent based on the level design.

803
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,220
大家可以看到 在这个视频中 我将边讲边播放视频
So you can see in this one, I'm going to play the video as I'm talking

804
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,930
然后可能会播放几次 
and then maybe play it a couple of times.

805
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,490
因此 为这些航空信仰号牌开发的技术
So the tech that was developed for these Aerial Faith Plates

806
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,466
是我们重复使用的玩耍帮手的东西 
is something that we reuse for a fling helper.

807
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:53,090
所以你可以看到这里有所有这些--
So you can see here there's all these--

808
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,070
我要打开一些调试绘图 
I'm going to turn on some debug draw.

809
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,140
你可以在这里看到 
And you can see right here.

810
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,150
这条绿色的弧线就是信仰板块上的弧线 
So this green arc here is the arc that's on the faith plates,

811
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,150
但你也可以看到有一些东西从那里的墙里出来 
but you can see there's some stuff coming out of the walls there as well.

812
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,610
所以这是水平的一部分 玩家将在那里抛出 
So this is a part of the level where the player is going to fling out of.

813
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,330
他要扔出一个盒子 实际上是因为他想让它起作用
He's going to fling a box out of that actually because he wanted this to work

814
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,410
对于物体和玩家来说都是如此 
for objects as well as the player.

815
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,840
所以你可以看到盒子从这里经过
So you can see as the box goes through here

816
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,050
然后在这里 这些是那些信仰的车牌 
and then here, these are those faith plates.

817
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,270
然后当盒子从盒子里出来时 我们
And then when the box comes out of that, we

818
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:34,111
让长方体沿着预定的弧线移动 
have the box follow the arc that's kind of predetermined.

819
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:36,860
因为我认为这是球员在这一点上所期待的 
Because that's I think what the player is expecting at that point.

820
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,550
他们本以为已经解决了问题的答案--解决了这个难题 
They expected to have solved the solution-- solve the puzzle.

821
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,630
但是漏斗 这里的导火索--
But the funnel, the trigger here--

822
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,370
这样可以纠正弧线 以确保它始终在运行
this kind of corrects the arc to make sure that it's always going

823
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,480
去球员期望的地方 
to go in the place the player expects.

824
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,435
我们也有同样的事情在球员身上发挥作用 
And we also have a case of the same things working for the player.

825
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:57,560
所以你可以看到这里有两条不同的弧线
So you can see here there's two different arcs that

826
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,520
是因为我们在这里加倍了扳机 
are coming out because we doubled up the triggers over here.

827
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,590
这些触发器在游戏中的工作方式
The way these triggers worked in the game

828
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,800
当玩家触摸它们时 它们并不总是启用 
is they won't always enable when the player touches them.

829
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,270
它们需要一个最小速度阈值 
They require a minimum velocity threshold.

830
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,550
所以玩家必须做大部分的工作 
So the player has to be doing most of the work.

831
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,570
所以玩家一定已经想出了一种方法
So the player has to have figured out a way in the level

832
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,990
通过拼图设计得到那个速度 
through the puzzle design to get that velocity.

833
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,260
但我们知道在物理学上有一些差异和差异
But we know that there's some differences in physics and differences

834
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,570
在你可能使用的确切机制中 
in the exact mechanism you might use.

835
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,930
所以我们只是说 如果你得到了我们所获得的最小速度 
So we're just saying if you got the minimum velocity that we acquire,

836
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,310
我们要把它一直带到那里 
we're going to take it all the way there.

837
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,870
所以在这个例子中 你可以看到我们有两个不同的案例 
So in this one, you can see we have two different cases.

838
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,790
所以如果我只是从传送门掉出来 它不会激活它们中的任何一个 
So if I just fall out of the portal, it's not going to activate any of them.

839
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,300
如果我设法获得了一些速度 
If I somehow manage to get some velocity,

840
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,350
将启动失败案例一并将我带到那里 
is going to activate the fail case one and take me there.

841
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,780
我们有失败案例一的原因是
And the reason we have the fail case one is

842
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,920
因为我们想确保如果玩家以某种方式
because we want to make sure that if players somehow get

843
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,069
大部分的速度都撞在墙上了 
most of the velocity but bonk on the wall,

844
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:58,110
他们不会一直认为他们可以--这才是正确的做法 
they don't keep thinking that they can-- that's the correct way to do it.

845
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,300
所以我们想让大家都知道你失败了 
So we want to make it obvious that you failed.

846
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,425
所以这又是同样的方式 
So again it's the same way.

847
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,383
我们必须帮助--你是在帮助球员 而不是通过给他们
We have to help-- you're helping the players out but not by giving them

848
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:05,060
解决方案 
the solution.

849
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,979
仅仅是通过明确你所做的事情是正确的还是错误的 
Just by making it obvious that the thing you did was correct or wrong.

850
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:11,270
然后 如果你在这个层次上做了正确的事情 
And then if you do the correct way in this level, which

851
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,730
就是让哲学做到这一点 然后你在那里建立一个门户 
is to get philosophy doing that, and then you make a portal there,

852
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,040
你要做正确的事情 然后摆脱它 
you're going to do the correct thing and swing out of it.

853
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,410
再说一次 这里的主要想法是消除这些假阴性 
And again, the main idea here is to get rid of those false negatives.

854
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,380
尤其是在这里 因为墙上有几个不同的地方
Especially here because there's a few different spots on the wall

855
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,777
你可以把一个传送门 
that you can put a portal.

856
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:33,860
我们真的不想限制很多这样的事情
And we don't really want to restrict a lot of that

857
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,526
然后把一个正方形放在墙上 
and just put the one square on the wall.

858
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,490
这就是解决方案的正方形 
That is the solution square.

859
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,330
因为同样 如果你把传送门放在这里 或者把传送门放在这里 
Because again, if you put the portal down here or put the portal up here,

860
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,470
弧线将会略有不同 
the arc is going to be slightly different.

861
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,120
所以这个机制 我们只是在某种程度上纠正
So this mechanism we had just kind of corrects

862
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,320
这些弧线 并确保它以我们想要的一到两种方式进行 
those arcs and makes sure that it goes in the one or two ways that we want.

863
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,080
我们加入的另一件事是--
Another thing we added in--

864
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,730
这是我们在门户2中添加的--
this we added in Portal 2--

865
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,210
是门户的亮点 这样您就可以看到
was highlights for your portals so you can see where

866
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,340
你的传送门是通过墙壁放置的 
your portals are placed through walls.

867
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,550
这是一个在关卡中非常有用的东西
And this is something that's super useful in levels

868
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,410
在那里你必须记录你放在那里的传送门 
where you have to keep track of which portal you placed over there.

869
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,300
所以你知道该把哪一个放在这里 
So you know which one to place over here.

870
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,107
因为有时候就像 好吧 我刚从蓝色的地方出来
Because sometimes it's like, OK, I just got out of the blue one

871
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:18,440
橙色的在那边 
and the orange one's over there.

872
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,797
所以如果我把蓝色的--
So if I place the blue one--

873
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,880
哦 我现在得把整个拼图再做一遍 因为我把拼图放错了 
oh, I got to do the whole puzzle again now because I placed the wrong one.

874
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,317
因此 这对确保您知道门户在哪里有很大帮助
So this helps a lot in just making sure that you know where your portals are

875
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:29,400
所以你可以表现得像我想走出这一步 
so you can be like I want to come out of that one,

876
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,585
所以我要把另一个放在 
so I'm going to place the other one.

877
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:34,460
这是我们在门户2中添加的东西 它非常有帮助 
And this is something we added in Portal 2 and it was pretty helpful.

878
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,730
在合作版本的游戏中 这也是有帮助的 
And it's also helpful in the co-op version of the game.

879
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,020
因为在合作公寓里 你想看到
Because in the co-op one, you want to see

880
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,800
两个玩家的门户一直都在那里
where both the players' portals are at all times

881
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,100
这种机械师在这方面起到了帮助作用 
and this kind mechanic helps in that.

882
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,160
我们增加的另一件事对球员有一点帮助
Another thing we added to kind of help the player a little bit

883
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,180
是一种我们称之为安置助手的东西 
is a thing we call the placement helper.

884
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,220
而这在游戏中并没有用到很多东西 
And this does not use a whole lot in the game,

885
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,830
但在游戏中有几个部分
but there's a few sections in the game where

886
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,760
我们想鼓励球员们站出来
we want to encourage the players to come out

887
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,250
在特定方向上的入口 
of a portal in a particular direction.

888
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,010
所以我们有这些东西 我们放置在一定半径的水平上 
So we have these things that we place in the level with a certain radius.

889
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,100
如果你把传送门放在这个半径内 
And if you place a portal within that radius,

890
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,640
我们只是把它按到那个方向--
we just kind of snap it to the direction--

891
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,452
到了它的中心 
to the center of it.

892
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:18,410
但他们没有计时器 
But they don't a timer.

893
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,610
所以 如果你放置一个传送门 你会说 
So if you place one portal and you're like,

894
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,790
哦 实际上我想把它放在这里 你可以随时选择不放 
oh, I actually want to place it over here, you can always opt out of it.

895
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,800
这也是我之前所说的 
And that's again what I was talking earlier.

896
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,160
你想补充什么--打扰一下 
You want to add something-- excuse me.

897
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,800
你想要添加这些助手的方式是 对于玩家来说 他们主要是
You want to add these helpers in a way that, for players, they're mostly

898
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,180
对大多数玩家来说是隐形的 
invisible to most of the players.

899
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,590
但想要退出的球员有办法选择退出 
But the players that want to opt out of them have a way of opting out of them.

900
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,766
[咳嗽声]
[COUGHS]

901
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:46,031
打扰了 
Excuse me.

902
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:49,090
所以你可以看到放置的第一个门户确实被截断了 
So you can see the first portal that's placed does get snapped,

903
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:53,260
但第二个被放置的正是玩家想要的位置 
but the second one that's placed is exactly where the player wanted.

904
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,640
我们在游戏中的一些地方使用了这些 
And we use these in a few spots in the game,

905
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,430
但它们并没有被大量使用 因为在大多数情况下
but they weren't used a whole lot because for the most part

906
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,380
你想要--你想确保球员感觉到
you want to have-- you want to make sure the player feels

907
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,379
就像他们控制了局面一样 
like they're in control.

908
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,990
还有一件很有趣的事
And one of the other things that was a lot of fun

909
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,070
在制作门户网站时 戴夫会对此大谈特谈--
while making Portal, and Dave will talk a lot about this--

910
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:17,120
打扰一下--稍后我会讲到很多关于门户的物理学 
excuse me-- will talk a lot about this later is the physics of portals,

911
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,380
或物体与门户相互作用的物理学 
or physics of objects interacting with portals.

912
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,440
在大多数情况下 我们都在努力做到超级准确 对吗？
And for the most part we're trying to be super accurate with it, right?

913
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,234
我们正在努力让东西按照玩家在现实生活中期望的方式工作
We're trying to make stuff work the way players expect in real life

914
00:45:27,234 --> 00:45:29,650
因为这就是我们试图在这里模拟的 
because that's kind of what we're trying to simulate here.

915
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,600
但我们认为我们在这里添加的一件事--我们认为
But one of the things that we thought that we added here-- that we thought

916
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,910
与其说准确 不如说有趣 
was more fun than accurate.

917
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:37,820
所以你可以看到--
So you can see the--

918
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,464
[咳嗽]
[COUGHING]

919
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,170
对不起 我有点不舒服 
Sorry, I'm a little bit sick.

920
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,140
你可以在这里看到 当盒子启动时 
You can see here that when the box starts off,

921
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,850
它就躺在地板上 
it's just resting on the floor.

922
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,960
所以它没有任何初始速度 
So it's got no initial velocity whatsoever.

923
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,830
所以当你把蓝色的传送门放下来时 期望
So when you place the blue portal down, the expectation

924
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,550
可能是它一直停留在那里 或者可能是
is probably that it keeps resting there or maybe it

925
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,440
走到入口的中央 就站在那里 
goes in the center of the portal and just stands there.

926
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,140
但这并不是一个超级有趣的游戏机械师 
But that's not a super fun game mechanic.

927
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,350
所以在这里 我们只需要让物体从入口出来
So here we just have it be so that objects coming out of portals

928
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,910
有一些最小的速度 
have some minimum velocity.

929
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,860
所以它们总是有一些最小的速度 
So they always have some minimum velocity.

930
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,590
这在游戏的许多其他部分都有效 比如油漆 
And this works in lots of other parts of the game like the paint.

931
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,090
你可以看到这里有一些空气
And you can see here that there is some air

932
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,920
阻力会发生 油漆会慢慢下降 
resistance that takes place and the paint does slowly come down.

933
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,330
但一旦它降到这个最小速度 它就会停留在那里 
But once it comes down to this minimum velocity, it just stays there.

934
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,890
而这是--这就像是完全捏造的小说 
And this is-- it's like completely fabricated fiction.

935
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,110
我想这并不是真正的物理学 
I guess there's no real physics for this.

936
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:37,120
这就像是这样比试图模拟真实的物理更有趣 
It's just kind of like this is more fun than trying to simulate real physics.

937
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,370
所以你可以看到这里的空气阻力
So you can see here air resistance is making

938
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,024
它会下降 就像他们在减速一样 
it go down, like they're slowing down.

939
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:43,690
但一旦它们达到最小速度 它们就会一直呆在那里 
But once they get to the minimum velocity, they just stay there.

940
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:47,180
就是这么回事 
This is about it.

941
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,700
所以 一旦它到了这里 它就会留在这里 
So once it gets here, it's just going to stay here.

942
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,033
它不会低于这个水平 
It's not going to go below that.

943
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,920
说到凝胶 凝胶实际上出现了--
And speaking of gels, the gels actually came up--

944
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,800
是我们为学生游戏想出的一个点子
were an idea that we had for our student game

945
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,057
这是我们在DigiPen时做的 
that we made while we were in DigiPen.

946
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:05,890
它被称为“标签--
It was called "Tag--

947
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,830
“绘画的力量 ”
The Power of Paint."

948
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:15,040
在TAG中 你有一把喷漆枪 你用它来拍摄不同的颜色 
And in Tag, you had a paint gun that you used to shoot the different colors.

949
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,560
传送门2的机械师就是从这个改编而来的 非常相似 
And the Portal 2 mechanic was adapted from this and it's pretty similar.

950
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,350
但我们为门户2去掉的一件事是
But one of the things we did get rid of for Portal 2

951
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,770
就是拥有喷漆枪的想法 
was the idea of having the paint gun.

952
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:31,840
因为我们在门户2上工作时的核心想法之一
Because one of the core ideas we had while working on Portal 2

953
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,760
我们添加到游戏中的任何机制都应该真正与门户网站一起工作
was that any mechanics we add to the game should really work with portals

954
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,980
而且应该真正与门户网站进行核心层面的互动 
and should really interact at a core level with portals.

955
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,400
所以我们想 与其用枪来移动油漆 
So we thought instead of using a gun to move the paint around,

956
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,610
使用入口来移动油漆会更有意义 
it will made much more sense to use the portals to move the paint around.

957
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,230
这不仅是凝胶的核心 也是任何新机械师的核心
And that was kind of core not just with the gels, but with any new mechanic

958
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,370
我们增加了比赛的内容 
we added to the game.

959
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,470
门户是奥运会的核心理念 
Was that portals is the core idea of the games.

960
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,340
我们所做的一切都应该以门户的工作方式为中心 
Everything we do should kind of center around how portals work.

961
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,650
我只是向你展示了我们在TAG中的不同颜色 
I'm just showing you the different colors we had in Tag.

962
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,240
我们在门户中添加的其中一种颜色不在标签中
One of the colors that we added in Portal that wasn't there in Tag

963
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,370
是门脉凝胶 
was the portal gel.

964
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,710
这又一次伴随着这样一个想法
And this was again going with the idea of how

965
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,920
我们是否能让凝胶和门户之间的互动更好 
do we make the gels and the portals interact better.

966
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,780
所以这个只是让你在白色油漆周围涂抹
So this one just lets you spread around white paint

967
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,281
所以你可以把入口放在油漆可以到达的任何地方 
so you can put portals anywhere that the paint can go.

968
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:29,030
这是一个相当酷的机械师
And this is a pretty cool mechanic in that

969
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,810
它允许更多的开放式关卡设计和更多的玩家
it allows for a lot more open-ended level design and a lot more player

970
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,650
自由 
freedom.

971
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,050
因为你现在基本上可以在任何地方玩门户网站 
Because you can play portals essentially anywhere now.

972
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,240
因为在很多比赛中我们限制了
Because for a lot of the game we're restricting

973
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,570
玩家可以在黑色表面或白色表面上放置入口 
where the players can put portals on the black surface or the white surface.

974
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,920
而这只是允许--
And this just allows--

975
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,730
你可以把白色放在任何地方 把门户放在任何地方 
you can just put white anywhere and put portals anywhere.

976
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,000
我们没有经常使用它 因为它是相当开放的
We didn't use this a whole lot because it is pretty open-ended

977
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,500
它确实打破了许多谜题设计 
and it does break a lot of puzzle designs.

978
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,180
但在一些情况下 我们以一种相当开放的方式使用它
But there are a few cases where we use it in a pretty open-ended way

979
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,960
让球员玩得开心一点 
and have the player just kind of have fun.

980
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,880
花一些时间来粉刷整个关卡 然后弄清楚该怎么做 
Spend some time painting the whole level and then figuring out what to do.

981
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,755
这类级别通常有几种不同的解决方案
And these kind of levels usually have a couple of different solutions

982
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:07,213
因为我们不知道球员们将在哪里作画 
because we don't know where the players are going to paint.

983
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:10,627
所以我们只是放了一堆不同的方式去出口和球员 
So we just put a bunch of different ways to get to the exit and players.

984
00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:12,210
一些玩家弄清楚了所有的旋钮 
Some players figure out all the knobs.

985
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,750
有些球员找到了第一个 然后就去了那里 
Some players find the first one and just go there.

986
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:20,030
它有助于打破传统谜题中的节奏
And it helps to break up the pacing a little bit from the conventional puzzle

987
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,330
用特定的斑点设计 这里是一些白点 这里
design with the specific spots where here are some white spots, here

988
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,970
是一些黑点 
are some black spots.

989
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,260
因此 这有助于在一定程度上打破这种局面 
So it helps break that up a little bit.

990
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,450
我们的学生游戏中有一件事没有通过
One of the things that didn't make it through from our student game

991
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,860
就是你在学生版中看到的粘性凝胶 
was the sticky gel that you saw in the student version.

992
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,960
所以这看起来会有点破损
So this is going to look a little bit broken

993
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,960
因为这是来自一个非常老的版本的门户2
because this is from a really old version of Portal 2

994
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,230
因为粘性凝胶很早就被剪断了 
because the sticky gel got cut pretty early on.

995
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,810
你会在这里看到一些并不是真的
And you're going to see some stuff here that doesn't really

996
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,120
这是有道理的 但要顺其自然 
make sense, but just go with it.

997
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,600
所以你可以看到我们这里用紫色而不是蓝色 
So you can see we used purple instead of blue here.

998
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,350
所以你可以跳上去--你可以走在墙上之类的东西上 这很酷 
So you can jump on-- you can walk on walls and stuff, which is pretty cool.

999
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,720
所以你可以看到蓝色的油漆从这里冒出来
So here you can see there's blue paint coming out of there

1000
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,110
但你看不到实际的油漆斑点 因为
but you can't see the actual paint blobs because there

1001
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,610
出于某种原因是看不见的 
are invisible for some reason.

1002
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,230
我想不通了 
I couldn't figure it out.

1003
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,744
但你可以看到墙上和地板上的实际油漆 
But you can see the actual paint on the walls, on the floor.

1004
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:14,660
所以这只是一种拼图的想法
So this is just an idea of the kind of puzzles

1005
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,094
我们试图想出使用粘性油漆的方法 
we were trying to come up with using sticky paint.

1006
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:20,010
出于某种原因 那里有一个额外的入口 
There's an extra portal there for some reason.

1007
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,960
别理它 
Ignore it.

1008
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,119
这是这个游戏的一个非常老的版本 
This is a really old version of the game.

1009
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,660
所以这就是我们想要解决的谜题 
So this is the kind of puzzles we are trying to come up with.

1010
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:32,870
将不同的油漆颜色和入口结合在一起 
Of combining the different paint colors and portals together.

1011
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,810
但我们最终还是删掉了这一功能 
But we did end up cutting this feature though.

1012
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,860
有几个不同的原因 
There were a few different reasons.

1013
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,060
其中之一显然是相当令人迷惑的 
One of them was obviously it is quite disorienting.

1014
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,970
你可以看到爬上一堵墙 试着找出
You can see going up a wall and trying to figure out where

1015
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,950
天花板在哪里 地板在哪里 
the ceiling is, where the floor is.

1016
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,640
尤其是在很多这样的层次上
Especially in a lot of these levels where

1017
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,270
它们大多是黑白的 
they're mostly just black and white.

1018
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,795
它变得相当令人迷惑 我们玩了很多次
It gets pretty disorienting and we had more than a few play

1019
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:55,970
测试人员对此颇有微词 
testers complain about that.

1020
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,710
但我们砍掉它的另一个重要原因是 它并没有真正
But the other big reason that we cut it is because it didn't really

1021
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,470
与门户网站进行良好的互动 
interact well with portals.

1022
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,220
你不会真的想走进一个
You don't really want to walk into a level

1023
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,130
并且已经为你准备好了花盆 
and have the pots already placed for you.

1024
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:11,540
而且没有真正好的方法在整面墙上制作花盆
And there's no real good way to make pots on the entire wall

1025
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,740
而不需要放置50次传送门 
without having to place the portal like 50 times.

1026
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,150
而且它与门户播放器的交互也不是很好
And also it didn't really interact well with the portal player

1027
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,080
物理和门户物理 戴夫将谈论更多关于球员的事情
physics and portal physics, and Dave will talk some more about the player

1028
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,730
通过传送门的物理 
physics through portals.

1029
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:30,020
这是你可以看到的其中一件事 
And this is one of the things that you can see.

1030
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,250
我们有一把喷漆枪 但最后我们把它剪断了 
We had a paint gun for a little bit, but we ended up cutting it.

1031
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,050
所以你可以看到我正在粉刷这里的墙
So you can see I'm painting the wall over here

1032
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,140
我要走在墙上 
and I'm going to walk on the wall.

1033
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,690
但当我进入蓝色入口时 你可以看到哦 它是
But as I enter the blue portal, you can see oh, it's

1034
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,020
不会让我通过的 
not going to let me go through.

1035
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,020
但如果我用这种方式 它会起作用的 
But if I go through this way, it works.

1036
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,720
这只是其中一件事 好吧 我们必须解决这个问题 
And that's just one of the things that's like, well, we've got to solve this.

1037
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,620
我们必须像这样装船 
We've got to ship like this.

1038
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,030
我们必须解决这些问题 
We've got to solve the problems.

1039
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,310
我们花了一些时间试图解决这些问题 
And we spent some time trying to work on these issues.

1040
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,060
但在某一时刻 你会意识到你并不是
But at some point, you realize that you're not

1041
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,190
无论你在这些问题上花费多长时间 都能保证解决它们 
guaranteed to solve these problems no matter how long you spend on them.

1042
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,190
所以在某种程度上 你得像这样 好吧 
So at some point you've got to just be like, OK,

1043
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,350
我不想多花一两个月的时间
I don't want to spend an extra month or two

1044
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,610
试图解决这些问题 不知道你是否能做到这一点 
trying to fix these problems not knowing if you'll get there.

1045
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:09,360
此外 还有其他原因导致机械师不能工作 
And plus there's other reasons why the mechanic isn't working out.

1046
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,790
所以 让我们停止这方面的工作 转而做其他事情 
So let's just stop working on this and work on other stuff instead.

1047
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,980
我们最后砍掉的另一样东西--
Another thing we ended up cutting--

1048
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:20,360
这是从1号门传来的 当时在纳巴卡拉空投是一种能力
this is from Portal 1 that was present in Narbacular Drop was the ability

1049
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,780
通过门户放置门户 
to place portals through portals.

1050
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,660
这是一件非常令人困惑的事情 
And it's a pretty confusing thing and that

1051
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,090
是我们取消比赛的主要原因 因为大多数球员只是
was the main reason we cut it because most players just

1052
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,890
我觉得这太让人困惑了 
thought it was way too confusing.

1053
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,723
因为你是通过看橙色来放置蓝色入口的
Because you're placing the blue portal by looking through the orange

1054
00:52:33,723 --> 00:52:34,250
传送门在这里 
portal here.

1055
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,974
所以蓝色的入口是--
So the blue portal is--

1056
00:52:35,974 --> 00:52:39,140
他指着这里的橙色传送门和那边的蓝色传送门
he's pointing through the orange portal here and facing the blue portal over

1057
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,630
这里是因为另一个蓝色的入口在他们后面 
here because the other blue portal is behind them.

1058
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,780
就像--这太令人困惑了 
It's just like-- it's too confusing.

1059
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,790
而且它也不是--
And also it doesn't--

1060
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:53,000
禁用这一功能并不会让你失去太多的拼图设计 
there's not a lot of puzzle design that you lose by disabling this feature.

1061
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,480
你得到的好处是玩家不会感到超级困惑
The thing you do gain is players aren't getting super confused

1062
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,450
而且你也不一定要剪下一堆拼图
and also you're not necessarily cutting a bunch of puzzles

1063
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,220
你现在做不到的事 
that you can't make now.

1064
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,800
因此 这个功能也被删减了 
So this feature got cut as well.

1065
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,410
这是我们并没有真正删减的东西 
And this is something that we didn't really cut,

1066
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,980
但我们停止了在门户2中使用在门户1中使用的一些内容
but we stopped using in Portal 2 that was used a little bit in Portal 1

1067
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,062
是两次放纵的想法 
was the idea of a double fling.

1068
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:16,230
我将在这里展示它 
And I'm going to show it here.

1069
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,190
所以两次放飞基本上就是把一个传送门
So double fling is basically placing a portal

1070
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,860
当你从传送门上掉下来的时候 
while you're falling out of a portal.

1071
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,190
它是其中一种运行得很好的东西 
And it's one of those things that it works pretty well.

1072
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:26,450
这是个很酷的机械师 
It's a pretty cool mechanic.

1073
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,090
它还在1号门的几个地方使用过 
And it was used in a few spots in Portal 1.

1074
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,210
有几个拼图需要它 就像这里的拼图需要你
A couple of puzzles required it, like this puzzle here required you

1075
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,890
来做这双倍的放纵 
to do this double fling.

1076
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,610
但我们注意到的一件事是有很多玩家
But one of the things we noticed was a lot of players

1077
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,380
很难执行很多这样的超大尺寸 
have difficulty in executing a lot of these super hyper-sized,

1078
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,630
高精度的动作 即使他们知道
high-precision movements even though they know

1079
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,190
这个谜题的解决方案是什么 
what the solution of the puzzle is.

1080
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,820
所以玩家走进这个房间 会想 好吧 我必须这么做 
So players will walk in this room and figure out, OK, I've got to do this,

1081
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,890
我必须这么做 这会奏效的 
I've got to do that, and this is going to work.

1082
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:54,590
但是很多玩家在走出入口时会遇到困难 
But then a lot of players have trouble walking out of a portal,

1083
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:58,040
以同样快的速度制作门户 会增加很大的压力 
making a portal as quickly, and it adds a lot of stress.

1084
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,940
我们想要摆脱很多基于抽搐运动的东西
And we wanted to move away from a lot of the twitch movement based stuff

1085
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,239
更像是 啊哈 我明白了 
and towards more of a kind of, aha, I got it.

1086
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:06,030
诸如此类的东西 
That kind of stuff.

1087
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,720
一旦你拿到了 我们不想让你花很多时间
And once you get it, we don't want you to spend a bunch of time

1088
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,144
确保你的动作准确无误 
in making sure you get the precise movements right.

1089
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,810
所以这个功能我们并没有真正删减 
So this feature we didn't really cut it.

1090
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,850
它仍然是在2号传送门工作的机械师 
It's still a mechanic that works in Portal 2,

1091
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,370
但门户2中的谜题都不再需要它了 
but none of the puzzles in Portal 2 required it anymore.

1092
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,460
一旦我们添加了关卡编辑器 很多玩拼图的人
And once we added the level editor, a lot of the puzzles people

1093
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,100
确实需要这样做 很多球员都喜欢这样 
are making do require it and a lot of players like it.

1094
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,100
但这并不是我们认为我们想让每个人都必须做的事情 
But it's not something that we thought we wanted to make everyone have to do.

1095
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:38,360
我们将门户1更改为门户2的另一件事
Another thing that we changed from Portal 1 to Portal 2

1096
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,735
就是这些能量球 
was these energy balls.

1097
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:45,140
这些能量球在当时--
These energy balls at the time--

1098
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,510
我们在门户1中使用它们的部分原因
part of the reason we used them in Portal 1

1099
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,410
是因为他们在《半条命》里
was because they were there in Half-Life and it

1100
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:56,760
是一个我们已经创造出来的机械师 我们可以不让他们知道 
was an already created mechanic that we had that we could just keep from them.

1101
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,610
但基本的机械原理是这些东西会起火--
But the basic mechanic is these things fire--

1102
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,890
这些东西发射这个弹跳的球
these things fire this ball that bounces around

1103
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,794
现在就得把它放到我枪下的这个容器里 
and it needs to go in this receptacle here under my gun right now.

1104
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:10,460
它应该放在这个容器里 一旦放到那里 
And it should go in this receptacle here and once it goes there,

1105
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,507
它完成了拼图 
it finishes the puzzle.

1106
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:14,590
不过 这位机械师有一些问题 
There are a few issues with this mechanic, though,

1107
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,720
这其中涉及到一系列的计时因素 
in that there's a bunch of timing element involved here.

1108
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,760
因为球的移动需要时间 
Because the ball takes time to travel.

1109
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,340
如果你被它击中 你也会死 
And also if you get hit by it, you die.

1110
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,500
我是说 这很好 
Which, I mean, it's fine.

1111
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,900
这是个游戏机械师
It's a game mechanic

1112
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,050
但对于门户2 我们只是在想 我们如何才能改进这个想法？
But for Portal 2, we just thought, how can we improve on this idea?

1113
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:37,480
我们想出的办法是用激光代替能量球 
And the thing we came up with was using lasers instead of the energy balls.

1114
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,820
把音量调低一点 
Lower the volume a little bit.

1115
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,190
所以你可以在这里看到它 它与1号门的高度相同
So here you can see it it's the same level from Portal 1

1116
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,400
你甚至可以看到能量球分配器被取代了
and you can even see the energy ball dispenser going away and being replaced

1117
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,025
因为我们要确保玩家是
by a laser because we want to make sure the player is

1118
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:51,320
比如 GLaDOS现在正在改进这些机制
like, GLaDOS is improving these mechanics now

1119
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,000
并得到了更好的版本 
and got better versions of it.

1120
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,280
所以激光实际上非常类似于能量球 
So the laser effectively is very similar to the energy ball.

1121
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,470
它放在一个里面 你想要它--
It goes in one and you want it--

1122
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,850
它进入这里 你想让它进入那边的容器 
it goes in over here and you want it to go to the receptacle over there.

1123
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:10,950
这里的最大优势是 反应是即时的 
The big advantage here is that the reaction is instant.

1124
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,040
因此 无论玩家是否得到了解决方案 它都是瞬间的 
So if the player got the solution or not, it's instantaneous.

1125
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,380
您不必在放置出口入口的情况下
You don't have to have situations where you place the exit portal

1126
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,690
现在你必须等待球穿过关卡
and now you have to wait for the ball to go all the way across the level

1127
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,220
看看它是否对齐了 
and see if it lines up or not.

1128
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,140
这样一来 它立刻就能做到这一点 
This way it just instantly does it.

1129
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:28,280
此外 它还打开了一系列不同的游戏机会
Plus it also opens up a bunch of different game play opportunities

1130
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,040
因为现在您可以在同一级别使用多个继电器 
because now you can use multiple relays in the same level.

1131
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,440
你可以得到重定向激光的立方体 
You can have the cube that redirects the laser.

1132
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,110
因此 总的来说 这感觉像是对能量球的改进 
So overall it felt like an improvement over the energy ball.

1133
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,380
谈到激光 到目前为止 我们已经
And talking about lasers, so far we've been

1134
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,630
谈论一大堆我们已经做出的小决定
talking about a bunch of these smaller decisions we've

1135
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,640
是为了解决这些不断出现的小问题 比如进入
made to solve these smaller problems as they kept coming up, like entering

1136
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,330
从传送门出来 确保东西都排好了 
exiting portals, making sure things are lined up or not,

1137
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,792
改进了具体的游戏机制 
improving on the specific game mechanics.

1138
00:56:57,792 --> 00:56:59,500
但你需要做的一件事是
But one of the things that you need to do

1139
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,810
当你试图让一场比赛变得完整
when you're trying to make a whole game is

1140
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:07,900
了解这些机制是如何结合在一起的 以及如何将它们结合在一起
to see how these mechanics come together and how you can combine them together

1141
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,160
才能做出一场完整的比赛 
to make a whole game.

1142
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,480
做一些增加难度、复杂性的谜题 
To make a few puzzles that increase into difficulty, complexity,

1143
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,760
然后走向某种高潮 
and go towards some crescendo.

1144
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,510
我们做到这一点的方法之一是使用这种过程
And one of the ways we did that is by kind of using this kind of process

1145
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,290
我要经历的一切 
that I'm going to go through.

1146
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,800
我们在门户1和门户2中都使用过它几次 
And we used it a couple of times both in Portal 1 and in Portal 2.

1147
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,280
有几种不同的机制 我们反复使用这个循环
And there's a few different mechanics that we used the cycle over and over

1148
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,030
为 
for.

1149
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,770
这就是整个游戏赛道的设计方式 
And that's kind of how the entire game track is designed.

1150
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,220
所以这是从介绍开始的 介绍
So it starts off with an introduction, and the introduction

1151
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,740
就是我们刚刚给你看的那个拼图 
is the puzzle we just showed you.

1152
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,739
这就是激光的入门难题 而且非常简单 
That's the intro puzzle for lasers and it's really straightforward.

1153
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:45,030
它只是向你展示了机械师 
It just shows you the mechanic.

1154
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,344
你穿过一扇门 从另一扇门出来 进入容器 
You go through one portal, come out the other, goes into the receptacle.

1155
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:49,510
这真的很简单 
It's really straightforward.

1156
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,860
介绍机械师 
Introduces the mechanic.

1157
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,080
大多数人都会在这件事上被绊倒 
Most people would get tripped up on this.

1158
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,620
然后 我们试着用同样的机械师让玩家饱和 
From there, we then try to saturate the player with that same mechanic.

1159
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,920
我们在这一点上引入了不同的曲折--
We introduce different twists on that same--

1160
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,630
如果不介绍一位全新的技师 
without introducing a whole new mechanic,

1161
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,250
我们只是推出了不同的版本 对同一想法进行了不同的调整 
we just introduce different versions, different tweaks on that same idea.

1162
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,450
所以这个房间里仍然只有激光 
So this room still only has lasers.

1163
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,260
但现在我们引入了继电器和立方体 
But now we've introduced relays and cubes.

1164
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:17,389
你可以进行实验 弄清楚如何将三个激光连接在一起 
And you can experiment, figure out how to connect the three lasers together.

1165
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:19,180
弄清楚如何移动立方体 弄清楚
Figure out how to move the cube, figure out

1166
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,000
如何让激光穿过传送门 
how to move the laser through the portals.

1167
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,490
但它仍然只是激光 
But still it's only lasers.

1168
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,630
目前还没有什么超级复杂的东西 
Nothing super complex yet.

1169
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,920
然后我们会给你更多这样的东西 
Then we give you more of that.

1170
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,330
我们为您提供更多相同的机械师 
We give you more of just the same mechanic.

1171
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:33,930
这里有两个发射激光的东西 还有两个你必须联系起来的东西 
Here there's two things firing lasers and two things you've got to connect.

1172
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,150
所以这是同样的想法 
And so it's the same idea.

1173
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,710
这就像只是使用激光 但不是非常复杂 
It's like just using lasers, but not super complex.

1174
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,010
只是在一点一点地建立在复杂性的基础上 
Just building on the complexity little by little.

1175
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,069
然后是一个拼图 就像 好的 这个
Followed by a puzzle that's like, OK, this

1176
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:46,360
是一个谜题 它将教你关于激光的一切 
is a puzzle that's going to teach you all about lasers.

1177
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,570
到目前为止 你已经以几种不同的方式看到了激光 
By now you've seen lasers in a few different ways.

1178
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,810
这个 一旦你得到这个 你就会明白激光是如何工作的 
This one, once you get this, you understand how lasers work.

1179
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,620
你知道关于激光工作原理的一切 
You know everything there is to know about how lasers work.

1180
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,990
所以这里的谜题--
So this puzzle here--

1181
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,280
打扰一下--这是两个立方体和三个发射激光的东西 
excuse me-- that's two cubes and three things firing lasers,

1182
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,051
在拼图的另一边 有
and on the other side of the puzzle there's

1183
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:05,800
三件事--你必须把它们联系起来 
three things-- you've got to connect them.

1184
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,680
这个谜题很难 但到了这一步 
And this puzzle is very difficult, but by this point,

1185
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,830
你被慢慢地介绍给不同的想法
you've been slowly introduced to different ideas

1186
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,410
激光是如何工作的 而这一次是将它们结合在一起 
of how lasers work and this one is taking them all together.

1187
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,640
一旦我们做到了这一点 我们就开始把它们结合起来 
And then once we've done that, then we start combining them.

1188
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,700
然后我们开始拍摄 好的 现在你有了激光
Then we start taking, OK, now you've got a laser

1189
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,790
一个不同的立方体和一座桥 
and a different cube and a bridge.

1190
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,700
在这一点上 你已经看到了一个完全不同的--
And by this point you've seen a whole separate--

1191
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,770
我们已经完成了整个入门、饱和、毕业跟踪
we've done the whole introduction, saturation, graduation track

1192
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,410
桥梁也是如此 
with bridges as well.

1193
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,980
所以到了这一步 你走进去 好的 我
So by this point, you go in there and, OK, I

1194
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,910
我知道桥梁是怎么回事 我知道激光是怎么工作的 
know how bridges, I know how lasers work.

1195
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,290
它们如何协同工作？
How do they work together?

1196
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,830
我如何将它们组合在一起？
How do I combine them together?

1197
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:41,740
然后我们从那里开始升级 
And then we start escalating from there.

1198
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:45,340
然后你进入这个有桥 有激光的拼图 
And then you go into this puzzle that has a bridge, has a laser,

1199
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,490
有一个炮塔 有一些立方体出来 有一个弹射器 
has a turret, has some cubes coming out, has a catapult,

1200
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:49,736
有一大堆这样的东西 
has a bunch of this stuff.

1201
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:51,610
但当玩家赶到的时候 他们已经
But by the time the player gets here, they're

1202
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,800
并不是真的不知所措 因为他们
not really overwhelmed by it because they

1203
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,650
已经分别介绍了所有这些机械原理 而且
have been introduced to all these mechanics separately and also

1204
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,370
它们的较小组合 
smaller combinations of them.

1205
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,277
所以当他们到达这一点时 
So that when they get to this point where

1206
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:02,110
有一堆不同的机制 他们
there's a bunch of different mechanics, they

1207
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:04,340
了解它们各自是如何工作的 
know how they all work individually.

1208
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,020
这就是我们使用的一种缓慢提升的过程
And that's kind of the process that we use of slowly ramping up

1209
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:12,220
难度 首先是单一的机械师 然后将它们结合起来 
the difficulty, first with a single mechanic, then combining them.

1210
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,961
然后这就是我们如何将单个较小的设计元素
And then that's kind of how we take the individual smaller design elements

1211
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,460
然后把它们结合在一起 把它们变成整个游戏 
and combine them together and turn them into the whole game.

1212
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:24,100
现在 我想戴夫会回来 谈论更多关于物理学的话题 
And now I think Dave is going to come back and talk some more about physics.

1213
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,780
戴夫·科尔彻：在我讲完这最后四个物理学知识之后 
DAVE KIRCHER: And after I cover these last four bits of physics,

1214
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,540
我们现在开始接受提问 
we're going to open up for questions.

1215
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,480
我知道我们在这里概述了一整节杂乱的内容 
I know we have a whole miscellaneous section that we've outlined here,

1216
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,520
但这更多的只是缓冲材料 
but that's more just buffer material.

1217
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,260
所以我希望你能重新开始你的空间思维 
So I'm hoping you're going to put your spatial thinking caps back on.

1218
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:50,930
因此 我们处理门户过渡的方式是有两种不同的方法 
So how we handle portal transitions is there's two distinct methods.

1219
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:54,670
一个是我们这里有音量 我们称之为触摸音量或触发器
One is that we've got volumes here, which we call touch volumes or trigger

1220
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,570
音量 
volumes.

1221
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,690
而这些都是围绕入口的中心 
And those are centered around the portal.

1222
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,177
所以我在这里有一个蓝色的入口 这是绿色的卷 
So I've got my blue portal here and that was green volumes here.

1223
01:01:02,177 --> 01:01:04,510
你会注意到它完全在入口的前面--
And you'll notice it's entirely in front of the portal--

1224
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,620
这一点很重要 
that's important.

1225
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,780
然后我们就有了这本黄色的书 
And then we've got this yellow volume here.

1226
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,840
所以黄色的体积是--
So the yellow volume is--

1227
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,960
它的全部工作就是告诉我们世界上哪些物体
it's whole job is to tell us which objects in the world

1228
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,997
就在传送门附近 我会回来的
are just kind of close to a portal, and I'll come back

1229
01:01:16,997 --> 01:01:18,580
为什么这是最重要的一分钟 
to why that's important to the minute.

1230
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,490
但它使我们不必去思考物体
But it separates us from having to think about objects

1231
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:25,204
它们在世界各地的白色空间里是遥不可及的 
that are way out in the world all over in the white space around here.

1232
01:01:25,204 --> 01:01:26,620
我们不需要考虑他们 
We don't have to think about them.

1233
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,020
我们也知道它们不是门户后面的物体
And we also know they're not objects behind the portal

1234
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,690
因为我们只对门户前发生的事情感兴趣 
because we're only interested in stuff that happens in front of the portal.

1235
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,500
而这里的绿色空间是大部分魔力发生的地方 
And this green volume here is where most of the magic happens.

1236
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,349
这本书说里面的物体离入口太近了
This volume says the objects in it are so close to a portal

1237
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:43,390
我们需要非常认真地思考他们能做什么 不能做什么 
we need to think very hard about what they can do and what they can't do.

1238
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:47,260
我们要让这些物体开始通过传送门 
We're going to let those objects start passing through the portal.

1239
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,650
因此 我们将这些对象放在两个单独的列表中 
And so we keep these objects in two separate lists.

1240
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:55,270
此绿色体积中的对象不再与任何对象相交
Objects that are in this green volume no longer intersect with any objects

1241
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,620
在外面的白色空间里 
out in the white space out here.

1242
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,119
他们不需要考虑这些问题 
They don't have to think about them.

1243
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,890
它们被保存在一个完全不同的列表中
They're kept in a completely separate list

1244
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,230
它们根本不会与它们相撞 
and they don't collide with them at all.

1245
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,720
它们也不会与世界几何体发生碰撞 
They also don't collide with world geometry.

1246
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,960
我稍后会讲到这一点 
I'll get to that in a bit.

1247
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,720
然后这个黄色体积中的物体是
And then objects in this yellow volume are

1248
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,780
绿色体积中的物体唯一需要担心的是 
the only ones that the objects in the green volume have to worry about.

1249
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,370
所以这些物体就像是靠近入口的东西 
So these are objects that are just kind of close to a portal.

1250
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,430
因此 与门户的另一个重要交互是光线投射 
And so another important interaction with portals is ray casting.

1251
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:22,660
所以我们只对穿过传送门四边形的射线感兴趣 
So we're only interested in rays that pass through the portal quad.

1252
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,445
因此 如果光线恰好通过入射平面 
So if a ray happens to just pass the portal plane,

1253
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:27,820
但不是与四边形相交 我们不会对它做任何事情 
but not intersect the quad, we don't do anything with it.

1254
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,690
这没什么特别的 
It's not special.

1255
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,689
我们只是像对待世界上任何其他射线一样对待它
We just treat it like any other ray in the world

1256
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:32,234
让它去做它快乐的事情 
and let it do its merry thing.

1257
01:02:32,234 --> 01:02:33,400
但我们找到了这个洋红色的家伙 
But we got this magenta guy.

1258
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,050
它与入口相交 
It intersects with the portal.

1259
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:39,400
所以现在我们必须重新投射出另一个橙色入口的新射线
So now we have to recast a new ray out the other orange portal which

1260
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,620
基本上给了我们两个光线段 
essentially gives us two ray segments.

1261
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,710
如果你想一下 如果你要写任何一段代码
And if you think about that, if you were to write any piece of code that

1262
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:48,014
刚刚进行了光线投射并交还了两个光线片段
just did the ray casting and hand back two ray segments

1263
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,180
当有人在期待的时候 你可能会得到奇怪的结果 
when somebody was expecting one, you're probably going to get weird results.

1264
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,551
所以这意味着 事实是 这种情况正在发生 
So this means, the fact that this is happening,

1265
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:56,800
这意味着我们必须通过游戏中的每一个系统 
means that we have to go through every single system in the game that possibly

1266
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,380
通过传送门投射一条射线 并修复每一个以理解 
casts a ray through a portal and fix every single one to understand.

1267
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:04,060
但如果我们给你多个片段 就会发生不同的事情 
But if we give you back multiple segments, different things happen.

1268
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,755
与其假设这个起点直接
Instead of assuming that this starting point goes directly

1269
01:03:06,755 --> 01:03:09,130
到这个终点 它甚至不是朝向
to this end point, which doesn't even go in the direction

1270
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:12,070
它一开始就想这么做 
it wanted to in the first place.

1271
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,950
所以在它的核心 记得我是怎么告诉你的
And so at its core, remember how I told you

1272
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:17,590
每个物体都有一个原点 一个点 
every object had an origin, a single point that

1273
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,110
定义它在空间中的位置 
defines where it is in space.

1274
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:23,170
我们使用光线投射来确定一个对象是否
We use the ray casting to determine if an object that's

1275
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,700
在这个绿色的体积里 就像是在四处走动 
in this green volume and just kind of moving around.

1276
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,699
我们用重铸的方式从一个点开始重铸
We use a recast from one point where it was

1277
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:29,740
从一帧到另一帧的一点
one frame to one point where it was another frame

1278
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,160
以查看它是通过门户还是在门户之外
to see if it either passed through a portal or outside the portal

1279
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,070
因为如果事情朝这个方向发展 我们什么都不会做 
because if it went over this way, we do nothing at all.

1280
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,020
如果我们走这条路 我们需要传送它 
If we went this way, we need to teleport it.

1281
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,970
这就是我们处理的基本方法 
So that's the basics of our handling.

1282
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,430
那么我们如何让物体穿过墙壁呢？
So how do we let objects pass through walls?

1283
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,040
这是我花了很多时间
This is one of the things I spent a whole lot of time

1284
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,141
因为我们希望我们的门户过渡非常无缝 
on because we wanted our portal transitions to be very seamless.

1285
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:56,140
还记得我给你们看的第一张幻灯片吗
Remember in one of my first slides I showed you.

1286
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,181
它应该像一扇门 
It should be like a door.

1287
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:00,070
人们希望走到门的一半 只是站在那里 
People expect to walk halfway through the door and just stand there.

1288
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,830
我们要做的是
And how we do this is--

1289
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,330
我先讲一下 
I'm going to talk about it a bit first.

1290
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:07,630
无论何时你放置一个传送门 我们都会对所有的世界几何形状进行快照
Whenever you place a portal, we take a snapshot of all the world geometry

1291
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,110
在你周围创造一个非常小的代表
around you and create a very small representation of that

1292
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,790
然后在上面刻个洞
and carve a hole in it.

1293
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:16,360
我们不为全世界做这件事 因为这需要太长的时间 
And we don't do this for the entire world because that takes way too long.

1294
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,780
太长了 我是说四分之一秒 
And by way too long, I mean a quarter of a second.

1295
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,345
从游戏的角度来说 这太长了 
And in game terms, that's just way too long.

1296
01:04:23,345 --> 01:04:25,220
我不知道是不是四分之一秒 
I don't know if it was a quarter of a second.

1297
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,430
我记得最初我们有一个问题
I remember originally that we had a problem where

1298
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,320
我想雕刻迷你版花了四分之一秒 
I think carving the mini-version took a quarter of a second,

1299
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,250
所以可能花了几秒钟
so it probably took several seconds.

1300
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,570
我将给你们展示一个场景 我有一个入口 
So I'm going to show you a scenario here where I've got a portal

1301
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,740
它将进入--
and it's going into--

1302
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:40,510
它沿着这个走廊入口走 跳板什么的
it's going along this corridor gateway, gangplank thing.

1303
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,939
它将进入这个小教室区域 
And it's going to go into this little classroom area.

1304
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:45,730
当我绕着墙走的时候 
And as I go back around the wall, I'm going

1305
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:51,130
给你们看一个我们的碰撞表示的调试网格 
to show you a debug mesh of our collision representation.

1306
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,430
在这个调试表示中 我们有这些绿线 
So in this debug representation, we've got these green lines.

1307
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:57,460
这些绿线和这些蓝线
These green lines and then also these cyan lines--

1308
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,960
或者我可能读错了
or I'm probably mispronouncing that.

1309
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,020
我叫它们蓝色 但我的同事告诉我 我需要叫他青色 
I call them bluish, but my colleague has told me I need to call him cyan.

1310
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,370
[吃吃地笑]
[CHUCKLING]

1311
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:06,070
所以我现在把它们叫做蓝色 
So I'm going to call them bluish now.

1312
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:11,420
这些绿线和蓝线是局部空间 
So these green lines and the blue lines are in local space.

1313
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,990
所以他们和我们在本地放置的蓝色入口在一起 
So they're with the blue portal that we placed locally.

1314
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,910
我知道这很难看出来 但是
And I know it's super hard to see, but there

1315
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,910
这里有一堆红线和一些洋红色的 
are a bunch of red lines over here and some magenta ones.

1316
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,140
这些来自教室里的另一个入口
Those are from the other portal that's in the classroom that

1317
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,420
被翻转并粘在我们当地门户的后面 
are flipped and glued to the back of our local portal.

1318
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,960
所以它都在这个本地空间和这个蓝色门户周围 
So it's all in this local space and around this blue portal.

1319
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,470
我们在它后面放了一些新东西 在它前面放了一些新东西 
We put some new stuff behind it and some new stuff in front of it.

1320
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,220
因此 你可能会问自己 这些颜色到底意味着什么？
And so you may be asking yourself what the colors actually mean?

1321
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:42,670
这里的绿色代表画笔几何体 大多数关卡编辑器 你可以
Green here is representing a brush geometry, which most level editors, you

1322
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:47,050
可以直接在关卡编辑器中创建墙和各种形状 
can create walls and various shapes directly in the level editor.

1323
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,950
至少在我们的术语中 我们将这些称为刷子 
And at least in our terminology, we refer to these as brushes.

1324
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:55,920
所以它们通常是非常简单的凸起形状 非常容易处理 
So they're usually very simple convex shapes and super easy to deal with.

1325
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,660
这个蓝色的几何图形来自已知的
And this bluish geometry is from what's known

1326
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,650
作为静态道具 这是某人在模型编辑器中建模的模型 
as a static prop, which is a model that somebody modeled in a model editor.

1327
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,690
所以这将是任意复杂的 但它
So it's going to be arbitrarily complex, but it

1328
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,360
必须由凸起的形状组成 
has to be made up of convex shapes.

1329
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,195
但我们会拍一张小快照 然后把它分割开来 
But we take a small snapshot of that and then carve it up.

1330
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:12,320
对不起 我忘了提了 
Sorry, I forgot to mention.

1331
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,640
所以我们称它为静态道具 因为我们保证它不会移动 
So we call it a static prop because we are guaranteed it does not move.

1332
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,160
这一点非常重要 因为它很容易模拟出
And that's very important because it's really easy to simulate things that

1333
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,600
不许动 
don't move.

1334
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,266
他们一动不动 
They don't move.

1335
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,530
这里的红色和洋红色也是如此 
And the same is true of the red and magenta here.

1336
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:29,680
红色是成对门户侧的笔刷几何图形
The red is the brush geometry on the paired portal side

1337
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,470
而洋红色是另一边的静态道具 主要是桌子 
and the magenta is static props on the other side, which is mainly the desks.

1338
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:37,100
当我从这里看过去的时候 
And as I'm looking through here.

1339
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:43,090
你可以看到一个小的快照 然后你
You can see just a small snapshot, and then you

1340
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,650
可以在这里看到这个洋红色的轮廓 在另一边的书桌网状物 
can see this magenta outline here of the desk mesh on the other side.

1341
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,860
重要的是要知道 看网眼的不是我
It's important to know that that's not me looking at the mesh

1342
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,960
通过传送门 
through the portal.

1343
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,710
这是当地的太空版 它只是
That's the local space version and it just

1344
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,950
碰巧把桌子排成一排 因为我们必须确保一切都排好 
happens to line up the desk because we have to make sure everything lines up.

1345
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,116
否则你们的身体互动会看起来很奇怪
Otherwise your physical interactions will seem weird

1346
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,000
如果某个东西在传送门的一半 它是
if something is halfway in a portal and it's

1347
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,902
好像没有撞到什么东西 或者撞错了 
kind of not colliding with something or it's colliding with it wrong.

1348
01:07:03,902 --> 01:07:05,860
当我走过时 你会注意到所有的颜色
As I walk through, you'll notice all the colors

1349
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,650
改变 因为我们交换了空间 当我走过一秒钟 
change because we switched spaces when I walk through in a second.

1350
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,720
所以现在所有的颜色都是这一边的局部空间 
So now all the colors are local space for this side.

1351
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,770
所以 是的 这就是我们挖洞的方式 
So, yeah, that is how we carve a hole.

1352
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:20,530
这是一个非常非常小的区域 我们可以在上面挖一个洞 
It's a very, very small area of the level that we carve a hole in.

1353
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:24,730
所以我们回到我在两张幻灯片前展示过的内容 
And so we're getting back to the volumes I showed you two slides ago.

1354
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,697
如果我们雕刻一小块世界的图画 
If we carve a small representation of the world,

1355
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:29,530
我们必须知道球员何时发生碰撞
we have to know when the player is colliding

1356
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,540
在这一点上与常规世界相比 
with that versus the regular world.

1357
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:34,180
因为如果它们与常规世界发生碰撞 
Because if they're colliding with the regular world,

1358
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,070
他们会撞上传送门后面的墙
they're going to collide with the wall that's behind the portal

1359
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,695
他们不会经历这一切的 
and they're not going to go through it.

1360
01:07:37,695 --> 01:07:40,599
所以我们必须独家使用那个雕刻版本
So we have to use exclusively that carved version

1361
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,890
当他们靠近传送门的时候 
when they're close to a portal.

1362
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,680
我们这样做--我们使用的是我之前说过的相同的体积 
And we do that-- we're using the same volumes I was talking about earlier.

1363
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,180
这是它们的3D表示 
This is a 3D representation of them.

1364
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,195
你会注意到它们有空间--
And you'll notice that they have space--

1365
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:50,320
入口上方和下方的大量空间 
a large amount of space above and below the portal.

1366
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,460
这一点很重要 因为它是3D空间 而不是2D空间 
That's important because it's a 3D space instead of a 2D space.

1367
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:59,030
因此 当我进入黄色空间时 我仍然与世界相撞 
So as I enter the yellow space, I still collide with the world.

1368
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:03,010
我仍然会撞上所有的桌子和东西 
I still collide with all the desks and things.

1369
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,010
因为我还在--虽然我只在黄色卷里 
Because I'm still-- while I'm exclusively in the yellow volume,

1370
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,814
我还在与这个世界碰撞 
I'm still colliding with the world.

1371
01:08:07,814 --> 01:08:08,730
我要给你们展示一下 
I'm going to show you.

1372
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,730
这是一个不好的例子 但这是我得到的视频 
It's a bad example, but it's the video I've got.

1373
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,880
我要撞到这张桌子后面的椅子
I'm going to hit this chair behind this desk

1374
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,620
因为它还在真实的世界里 
because it's still in the real world.

1375
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,350
然后当我过渡到绿色音量时 
And then as I transition into the green volume,

1376
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:21,590
我完全是在与我们雕刻的版本发生碰撞 
I am exclusively colliding with our carved version of it.

1377
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,880
这--这是一个糟糕的框架削减 
Which-- that was a bad frame to cut.

1378
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,220
如果我碰巧回过头来看传送门--
If I happen to look back in the portal--

1379
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,990
哪一方在擦洗？
which side is scrubbing?

1380
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,750
好的 
OK.

1381
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,510
抱歉的 
Sorry.

1382
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,720
因此 如果你碰巧在入口内看 你可能会看到它 
So if you happen to look inside the portal, you might be able to see it.

1383
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,886
有--我知道这很难看 对不起 
There is-- I know it's super hard to see, I'm sorry.

1384
01:08:39,886 --> 01:08:40,930
但我们确实挖了一个洞 
But we did carve a hole.

1385
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,730
不 这里没有几何学阻止我们进入 
There's no there's no geometry right here to stop us going in.

1386
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,729
由于我们只使用这种新的网状物 
And since we're exclusively using this new mesh,

1387
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:47,770
我们被允许只通过那个空间 
we're allowed to just go through that space.

1388
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:54,939
好的 所以比静态几何更重要的是 
OK, so more importantly than static geometry, which

1389
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:57,189
不会移动 而且非常容易物理模拟 
doesn't move and is super easy to physically simulate,

1390
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:00,130
我们有充满活力的道具和可以移动的东西 
we have dynamic props and things that move.

1391
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,830
特别是在这种情况下 盒子 
Specifically in this case, boxes.

1392
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:07,260
因此 我们建模的方式与我们处理几何体的方式非常相似 
So the way we model this is very similar to how we did with geometry.

1393
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,310
我们要复制所有的东西 而我
We're going to be duplicating everything and I'm

1394
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,018
我将通过走进传送门来向你展示 
going to show you by walking in a portal.

1395
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:15,040
所以刚才出现的这个蓝色盒子就是我的播放器 
So this blue box that just appeared is my player.

1396
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,240
我的物理玩家从这个橙色的门户复制的对象
My player of physics object that's replicated from this orange portal

1397
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,649
蓝色传送门的背面 
to the backside of the blue portal.

1398
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:24,231
这是使用一种被称为物理阴影的系统 
And this is using a system known as a physics shadow.

1399
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:25,689
至少我们的系统是这样的 
At least that's what our system is.

1400
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:26,814
我不是一个真正的物理学家 
I'm not really a physicist.

1401
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:29,060
这就是我们所说的我们对它的表现 
That's just what we call our representation of it.

1402
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:33,069
所以我的意思是 当我谈到这一点时 我还没有处理过太多的物理系统 
So I mean, I haven't dealt with many physics systems when I talk about that.

1403
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:36,220
所以物理阴影的作用是不同的
So what a physics shadow does that's different

1404
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,700
比我们的渲染几何体更重要的是 我们不能真正地传送它
than our rendering geometry is we're not allowed to actually teleport it

1405
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,220
从一帧到下一帧 因为如果你传送一个物理
from one frame to the next because if you teleport a physics

1406
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,700
对象 然后各种相交的交互作用 
object, then all sorts of interactions that intersect,

1407
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,410
他们没有以前的基础可言 
they have no previous basis to go from.

1408
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,590
比如如何解决这个问题 
Of like how to solve that.

1409
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,950
他们不能让时间倒流 因为他们突然传送了
They can't rewind time because they've suddenly teleported

1410
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,340
进入一个相互穿透的空间 
into an interpenetrating space.

1411
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,160
所以我们所有的物理物体--
So all of our physics objects--

1412
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,800
我们给他们一个目标 告诉他们需要去哪里 
we give them a target of where they need to go.

1413
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,930
抱歉 并不是所有的物理选项都是阴影 
Sorry not all of our physics options are shadows.

1414
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:03,739
所以就像播放器音量和我接下来给你们的例子一样 
So just like the player volume and just the examples I'm about to give you.

1415
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:06,280
我们告诉他们我们想要他们去的地方 他们尽了最大努力
We told them where we want them to go and they try their best

1416
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,650
向那里施加力和旋转 但如果它不起作用 
to apply forces and rotations to go there, but if it doesn't work,

1417
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:13,330
我们有点像索尔 他们会尽力的 
we're kind of SOL and they do their best.

1418
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:15,830
所以我正在为那边的玩家复制这一点 
So I'm replicating that for the player over there.

1419
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,680
我们还将在一秒钟内为立方体复制它
And we're also going to replicate it for the cubes in a second

1420
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,010
一旦我抽出时间来摆放它们 
once I get around to placing them.

1421
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,760
所以重要的是要注意 我们并不是真的
And so it's important to note that we're not really

1422
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,910
解决空间中的不连续性 因为
solving the discontinuity in space because that

1423
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:31,000
这太难了 至少对我这种技术水平的人来说 
would be way too hard, at least for a person of my skill level.

1424
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,240
我们所做的是 我们说双方都有--
What we're doing is we're saying each side has--

1425
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,810
这个立方体是它的物理学大师
this cube over here is the master of it's physics and this cube over here

1426
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,550
是自身物理学的大师
is the master of its own physics.

1427
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:42,070
这个立方体只是想复制
And this cube over here is just trying to replicate

1428
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,210
不管这家伙在做什么
whatever this guy is doing.

1429
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:47,170
所以它们并不完全一致 但它们工作得很好 
So they don't quite line up, but they work well enough.

1430
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:51,590
在游戏开发中 足够好通常会走很长的路 
And in game development, good enough usually goes a long way.

1431
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:54,510
所以当我使用它的时候 你可能会注意到它们并不是很好用 
So as I'm using it, you might notice they don't quite work super well,

1432
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:57,010
但你可以看到我在这里有一个代表 
but you can see that I've got this representation over here.

1433
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,550
我在我的虚拟版本中推动它 所有的东西都在排队 
I'm pushing it in my virtual version and it's all lining up kind of.

1434
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,740
是的 这就是我们在《传送门》中的做法 
And, yeah, that's how we do it in Portal.

1435
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:06,490
所以我要告诉你们我很高兴我们
So I'm going to go ahead and tell you that I'm really glad that we

1436
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,531
我没有超过两个立方体的关卡 因为如果你试着这样做 
didn't have levels with more than two cubes because if you try to do this

1437
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,280
有一列立方体--三四个--
with a train of cubes-- three or four--

1438
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,360
它会坏得很厉害
it breaks down horribly.

1439
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,980
最后一点是我向你们展示的
And this last little bit is me just showing you

1440
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,140
我们没有和它后面的任何东西相交
that we're not intersecting with anything in the back of it

1441
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,723
因为我们不在绿色或黄色的区域内
because we're not inside the green volume or the yellow volume

1442
01:11:19,723 --> 01:11:21,089
因为我们在传送门后面
because we're behind the portal.

1443
01:11:21,089 --> 01:11:24,130
管理你的列表是非常重要的
It's really important to manage your lists of what can interact with what

1444
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:28,900
当我们在空间中伪造洞和重叠空间时 
when we're faking holes in space and overlapping space.

1445
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:32,480
我在这上面花了很多时间 
I spent a whole lot of time on this.

1446
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,290
我想我们的物理材料就到此为止了 
And I think that is the end of our physics material.

1447
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,250
所以我们有了更多的杂项填充材料 
So we had some more miscellaneous filler material,

1448
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,460
但看起来我们已经超过了最初的时间 
but it looks like we've ran over a little bit of our initial time.

1449
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,410
所以我们现在要开始问答了 
So we're going to open up to Q&amp;A now.

1450
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,460
我们以后可能会谈到我们的杂项材料 
We might get to our miscellaneous material later.

1451
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:50,610
但是 如果有人有问题 现在是个好时机 
But, yeah, if anybody has got questions, now would be a good time.

1452
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:56,901
观众：你能谈谈灯光是如何与门户互动的吗？
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a little bit about how lights interact with portals,

1453
01:11:56,901 --> 01:12:00,720
或者只是在物体上照明 比如 你会从入口得到阴影吗？
or just lighting on objects and, like, will you get shadows from the portal?

1454
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,747
戴夫·奇彻：最初 我有一张幻灯片 
DAVE KIRCHER: So originally, I had a slide on that.

1455
01:12:03,747 --> 01:12:05,580
TEJEEV KOHLI：这个问题是关于灯的 
TEJEEV KOHLI: The question was about lights.

1456
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,580
戴夫·基尔希：哦 对不起 
DAVE KIRCHER: Oh, sorry.

1457
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,410
是的 对不起 
Yes, sorry.

1458
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:11,460
问题是光是如何与入口、阴影和其他东西相互作用的 
The question was how lights interact with portals and shadows and things.

1459
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,069
所以我想先说的是 我十年前做的大部分事情 
So I'm going to preface with saying that most of this stuff I did a decade ago.

1460
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:17,610
所以如果我说了假话 我不是在撒谎 
So if I say something that's not true, I'm not trying to lie.

1461
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,230
我就是不记得了 
I just don't remember it.

1462
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,080
所以基本上在传送门1的时候
So basically there was a time during Portal 1

1463
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,200
在那里我们非常努力地让光通过传送门
where we tried very hard to make light work through portals

1464
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,450
我们决定用一种便宜的方法
and we kind of settled on a cheap solution.

1465
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,990
我们会在一个入口前定义一个点 
Where we would define a point barely in front of one portal,

1466
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:33,780
看看是什么光投射了多少颜色
see what lights were projecting what amount of color on that,

1467
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:37,170
在另一边做成一个巨大的球体
and just kind of make it a massive sphere on the other side that

1468
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,880
会这么做
would kind of do that.

1469
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,760
所以缺点就是你只注意到了
So the downside was is that you only noticed it

1470
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,150
在对比度非常高的情况下 
in cases that were very high contrast, which is also the case in where

1471
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:46,200
是最破的
it was the most broken.

1472
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,162
所以我们不做 
So we just don't do it.

1473
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:51,120
TEJEEV KOHLI：在传送门2上 我们尝试了一段时间 
TEJEEV KOHLI: On Portal 2, we tried for a while

1474
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,330
让传送门本身将光线投射到物体上
to have the portals themselves project light on things

1475
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,610
也有一段时间被打破了
and that was also kind of broken for a while.

1476
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,769
然后我们就把它取出来了
And then we just took it out.

1477
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:00,810
戴夫·基尔彻：是的 所以我们只是在这一点上下注 
DAVE KIRCHER: Yes, so we just punted on that one.

1478
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,630
不难.
Too hard.

1479
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,139
TEJEEV KOHLI：还有其他问题吗？
TEJEEV KOHLI: Any other questions?

1480
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:06,633
好的当然
Yeah, sure.

1481
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,632
观众：对性能的影响是什么
AUDIENCE: What were the performance implications

1482
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:12,910
需要在模板缓冲区中多次绘制吗
of having to draw on that stencil buffer multiple times?

1483
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,880
戴夫·基尔彻：所以问题是 
DAVE KIRCHER: So the question was what were the performance

1484
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,440
这意味着必须使用模具缓冲区绘制多个场景 
implications of having to draw multiple scenes with the stencil buffer.

1485
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:27,351
所以这和画一个更复杂的场景很相似 
So it's very analogous having to just draw a more complex scene.

1486
01:13:27,351 --> 01:13:29,100
你只是在画更多的四边形什么的 
You're just drawing more quads and things.

1487
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,080
在我们杂项部分的一张幻灯片上--
On one of the slides in our miscellaneous section--

1488
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:31,720
你知道吗？
you know what?

1489
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,428
我为什么不直接说呢？
Why don't I just go ahead and jump to it?

1490
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,100
所以这很重要 
So it's very important.

1491
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,240
所以当我们在3D空间中渲染事物时 
So when we're rendering things in a 3D space,

1492
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,770
我们有一个所谓的平截头体 
we have what's known as a frustum.

1493
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,552
有点像金字塔 从你的相机里出来 
It's kind of a pyramid, which comes out from your camera.

1494
01:13:44,552 --> 01:13:47,260
你可以用它作为一个非常快速的测试 看看你是否应该 
And you can use it as a very quick test to see if you should even

1495
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,950
也懒得去渲染什么
bother rendering something at all.

1496
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,690
所以我有
So I've got--

1497
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:50,800
我要用我这边
I'm going to use my side--

1498
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,640
我的两侧 
my sides.

1499
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,070
这些边是由屏幕本身定义的 
The sides are defined by the screen itself.

1500
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,620
所以你画的屏幕有一个顶部 有一个底部 
So the screen that you're drawing has a top, has a bottom,

1501
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,810
所以这些东西投射到太空中 
so those project into space.

1502
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:01,904
所以我们站在一边 我们可以说 如果一个物体完全
So we take our one side we can say, OK, if an object is completely

1503
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,820
在飞机的另一边 我们甚至不
on the other side of this plane, we don't even

1504
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,200
我需要费心去画它 
need to bother trying to draw it.

1505
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,549
我们可以跳过它 
We can just skip it.

1506
01:14:06,549 --> 01:14:08,590
因此 我们在门户网站中进行的优化之一
And so one of the optimizations we have in Portal

1507
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:11,020
就是每次你通过传送门看的时候 
is that every time you look through a portal,

1508
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,990
我们可以找到一个更小的空间的平台体 
we can find the frustum to a smaller space.

1509
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:18,160
我选择了一条简单的路线 因为我把它作为一个物体保存下来
I took the easy route in that I kept it as an object that

1510
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,830
仍然有四个截然不同的方面 
still had four distinct sides.

1511
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,450
所以有时候它有点坏了 
So sometimes it's a little bit broken.

1512
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:24,792
但在这种情况下 你可以看到--
But in this case, you can see--

1513
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:27,250
在这种情况下 您可以看到我正在通过一个蓝色的入口查看
in this case, you can see I'm looking through a blue portal

1514
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,654
在这里的这个小按钮上 
at this little button here.

1515
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:30,820
我得到了这个--它可能是不可能看到的 
And I've got this-- it's probably impossible to see,

1516
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,740
但我已经把这个网状物拿出来了 
but I've got this mesh coming out.

1517
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,800
这是我们试图绘制的所有东西的最新平截体 
This is the updated frustum of everything we try to draw.

1518
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,890
所以你可以看到 它主要是封装了一些级别
So you can see it mostly just encapsulates a little bit of level

1519
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,820
以及按钮本身 这有助于我们甚至不尝试绘制
and the button itself, and that helps us not even attempt to draw

1520
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,140
一遍又一遍的完整场景 
the complete scene over and over again.

1521
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,030
但我想我从来没有做过性能分析 
But I don't think I ever did a performance analysis,

1522
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,590
所以我不能给你具体的数字 
so I can't give you concrete numbers.

1523
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,480
但这比试图一遍又一遍地画整个场景要好 
But it was better than trying to draw the entire scene over and over again.

1524
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,100
因为既然我们这边还有深度缓冲 
Because since we still had the depth buffer on our side,

1525
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,827
我们已经画出了屏幕的大部分 
we had already drawn most of the screen.

1526
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:03,910
然后我们也有模板缓冲区告诉我们
And then we also had the stencil buffer telling us

1527
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,430
甚至不会尝试绘制大部分像素 
not to even attempt to draw most of the pixels.

1528
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:10,540
这远没有试图渲染整个场景那么糟糕 
It was not nearly as bad as trying to render the entire scene.

1529
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,487
但我们确实发现了当时的显卡 这甚至不是
But we did find that for the graphics cards of the day, which not even

1530
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:15,070
它们都支持模板缓冲区 
all of them supported stencil buffers.

1531
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:18,700
一些玩传送门1的人 他们得到了纹理 
Some people that played Portal 1, they got textures.

1532
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,890
我们发现最好将递归限制为两次
We found it was best to just limit to two recursions

1533
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,610
因为我们可以做我们的深度 或者我们可以做我们的递归假
because we could do our depth, or we could do our recursion fake

1534
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,820
而且它运行得很好 
and it worked pretty well.

1535
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,611
我不认为它是非常昂贵的
And I don't think it was terribly expensive

1536
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:28,930
即使是在今天的纸牌上 
even for the cards of the day.

1537
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,490
TEJEEV Kohli：我知道在2号传送门期间有一些病例
TEJEEV KOHLI: I know there were cases during Portal 2

1538
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:34,000
当我们试图让它在游戏机上工作时 
when we were trying to make it work on consoles,

1539
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,450
有很多的验证测试 
there was a lot of proof tests.

1540
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,927
有四个案例 特别是在合作社 
There were four cases, especially in co-op,

1541
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:41,260
当您在屏幕上同时显示四个入口的分屏模式下玩游戏时
when you're playing in split-screen with four portals on screen at the same time

1542
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,660
大家都面面相觑 
all looking at each other.

1543
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,420
这就像是同时渲染了整个世界的16个视图 
It's like 16 views being rendered of the entire world at the same time.

1544
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,670
有一些奇怪的边缘案例 比如 
And there were these like weird edge cases where like,

1545
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,280
如果你这样做 你会得到每秒两帧 
if you do that, you get two frames per second.

1546
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,574
不要那样做 
Just don't do that.

1547
01:15:52,574 --> 01:15:54,270
[笑]
[LAUGHING]

1548
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:57,450
有一些东西在水平上发生了变化--
There was a few things in levels that had changed where--

1549
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,440
好像角落里的案子是最糟糕的 
like the corner case was the worst.

1550
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,840
如果你有这样一堵墙 而你
Where if you have a wall like that and you

1551
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,830
可以在角落的两侧放置一个紧挨着的入口 
can put a portal right next to each other on both sides of the corner.

1552
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:09,550
所以我们有几个案例 我们不得不实际改变水平
So we had a couple of cases where we had to actually change the levels

1553
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:11,720
不再有那些案子 
to not have those cases.

1554
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,540
所以你不能玩--
So you can't play--

1555
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,070
所以我们只是把角落分开了 大概有16个单元之类的 
so we just moved the corners apart like 16 units or whatever.

1556
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:19,930
因此 您不能总是通过两个视图同时看到两个门户 
So you can't always see both portals through both the views.

1557
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:23,050
所以有一些类似的事情我们必须特别地解决
So there was stuff like that we had to work through especially

1558
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,370
在以前的游戏机上 
for consoles back in the day.

1559
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:28,210
就像我们在PS3 360上工作一样 
Like we were working on PS3 360s.

1560
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,469
我相信现在好多了 但我们已经很久没这么做了 
I'm sure now it's better, but it's been a long time since we've done that.

1561
01:16:31,469 --> 01:16:33,760
戴夫·科尔彻：如果我没记错的话 使用的是模版印刷
DAVE KIRCHER: If I remember correctly, using stenciling

1562
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,476
比使用纹理要便宜得多 
was strictly less expensive than using textures,

1563
01:16:36,476 --> 01:16:39,100
因为你仍然要画相同数量的几何体 
because you're still going to draw the same amount of geometry,

1564
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:43,260
但你没有任何质地成本 
but you have no texture cost whatsoever.

1565
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,760
希望这能回答大部分问题 
Hopefully that answers most of that.

1566
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:50,724
观众：你是如何覆盖每一关的所有基础的 
AUDIENCE: How did you cover all of your bases for each level,

1567
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:52,495
这样球员就永远不会被卡住了？
so that a player could never get stuck?

1568
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:54,203
从这个意义上说 如果你从悬崖上掉下来
In the sense that if you fell off a cliff

1569
01:16:54,203 --> 01:16:57,682
或者是不小心抹去了一个传送门 你总能找到回到过去的方法
or maybe accidentally erased a portal, you could always find a way to go back

1570
01:16:57,682 --> 01:16:59,569
还是继续前进？
or to keep progressing forward?

1571
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:01,360
TEJEEV Kohli：问题是我们如何
TEJEEV KOHLI: The question was about how we

1572
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,730
覆盖了我们的基地 以确保球员不会陷入关卡
covered our bases to make sure the players can't get stuck in levels

1573
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:07,310
如果他们做了坏事 
if they do something bad.

1574
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:11,590
主要是通过播放测试 然后是错误测试 
Mostly through play testing and then later on through bug testing.

1575
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:16,550
这是一项很大的工作 只是为了确保你能看到水平的一部分
It's a lot of just trying to make sure that you can see parts of the level

1576
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,030
来自不同的地方 
from different parts.

1577
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:23,000
到后来的过程 当我们越来越接近发货时 
Towards the later process of when we're getting closer to shipping,

1578
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,780
我们做一种叫做油腻的猪通行证的水平 
we do something called the greasy pig pass for the levels.

1579
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,667
在那里我们确保玩家不会真的被困在墙上
Where we make sure the players can't literally get stuck on walls and stuff

1580
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,000
当他们穿过它们的时候 
as they're walking through them.

1581
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,170
所以我们有一堆看不见的几何图形
So we have a bunch of invisible geometry there

1582
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:39,670
这将使沿楼梯和沿-的碰撞变得平滑 
that'll make smooth the collisions along stairs and along--

1583
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:42,620
因为特别是在2号传送门 有一堆这样的碎片
because especially in Portal 2, there's a bunch of these broken pieces

1584
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,560
还有一堆树叶和水平的破碎部分
and a bunch of foliage and broken parts of the levels

1585
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,590
以奇怪的角度倾斜之类的东西 
that are tilted at weird angles and stuff.

1586
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:53,790
在很大程度上 我们让它们保持原样 
And it's like for the most part, we left them as is.

1587
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,320
但很多情况下 我们不得不把无形的东西放进去
But a lot of cases we had to go in and put invisible stuff

1588
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,810
以确保这堵墙可能
everywhere to make sure that the wall might

1589
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,450
看起来像是被分成了15个不同的部分 
look like it's broken up into like 15 different pieces,

1590
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,830
但玩家只是撞上了一架平板飞机 
but the player's just colliding with a flat plane.

1591
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:09,200
它是为了确保这些事情不会发生在
It's to make sure that those things don't happen where

1592
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,540
球员们不会卡在斑点上 
the players don't get stuck in spots.

1593
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,631
也有一系列的水平设计工作 确保--
And there's also a bunch of level design work that goes around and making sure--

1594
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:18,130
因为我们也要照顾到相反的情况 对吗？
because we have to take care of the opposite as well, right?

1595
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,129
我们得照顾好 嗯 我们得
We have to take care of, well, we've got to make

1596
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:23,060
当然 玩家可以从关卡的起点看到出口入口
sure the player can see the exit portal from the start of the level

1597
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,810
因此 他们不能只通过门户和门户就能走到最后 
so they can't just portal and portal and get to the end.

1598
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:30,900
因此 这样做也有助于你所提出的问题 
And so doing that process helps with what you are asking as well.

1599
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,160
因为如果你能确保漏洞不在那里 
Because if you can make sure that the exploits aren't there,

1600
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,580
你也摆脱了玩家可以让自己
you're also getting rid of cases where the player can get themselves

1601
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,910
在一个糟糕的位置 
in a bad spot.

1602
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:43,260
因此 它在某种程度上是通过发展过程自行解决的 
And so it kind of works itself out through the course of development.

1603
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,290
你不会一开始就做一个拼图
You don't go in starting to make a puzzle

1604
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,050
或者在脑海中充分利用这一点 
or making a level with that in mind a whole lot.

1605
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,079
但当你开始改进它时 事情就会调整 事情就会调整 
But as you start refining it, things get tweaked and things get tuned.

1606
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:54,620
由于端口等原因 您可能需要对某些内容进行调整 
Some things you might be have to tweak for like port reasons.

1607
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,530
这在PS3上是行不通的 
Like this doesn't work on PS3.

1608
01:18:56,530 --> 01:19:00,504
所以你得走了 好的 我得解决这个问题 稍微调整一下拼图 
So you got to go, OK, I got to fix this and tweak the puzzle a little bit.

1609
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:02,420
但一旦你调整了拼图 现在你就
But then once you tweak the puzzle, now you've

1610
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,211
整个测试得从头再来一遍 
got to do the whole testing all over again.

1611
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:06,980
因为好吧 我不能就这么把门楼放在那里
Because all right, I can't just put a portal place on there

1612
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,100
因为现在你不需要做任何事情就可以解开谜题 
because now you can solve the puzzle without doing any of it.

1613
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,930
因此 从这个意义上说 还有很多工作要做 
So there's a bunch of work that has to go on from that sense.

1614
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:14,055
戴夫·科尔彻：需要注意的是 当我们
DAVE KIRCHER: And it's important to note that as we

1615
01:19:14,055 --> 01:19:17,030
更接近于发货产品 我们的开发团队中越来越多的人
get closer to shipping a product, more and more of our dev team

1616
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,650
切换到播放测试 
switches to play testing.

1617
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,170
我们有一些非常聪明和淘气的人
And we have some very smart and mischievous people

1618
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:24,310
具体的问题是 你如何确保你不会被困在
that that specific question of how do you make sure you don't get stuck

1619
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,284
都在核对表上 
is on the checklist.

1620
01:19:25,284 --> 01:19:27,200
它至少在我的清单上 就像 我是
It was on my checklist at least of, like, I am

1621
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,370
以确保我不会被卡住 
going to make sure I can't get stuck.

1622
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,770
我要在这个楼层坐大约半个小时
I'm going to sit in this level for about half an hour

1623
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,800
好好想一想如何让自己陷入困境 
and think long and hard about how to get myself stuck.

1624
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,632
如果我做不到 那就算了 
And if I can't do it, then pass.

1625
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:36,596
[咯咯地笑]
[CHUCKLES]

1626
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:43,435
观众：你有没有想要追求的东西 
AUDIENCE: Was there anything that you would have liked to have pursued,

1627
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:46,400
但没有 因为运输的时间限制
but didn't, due to either time constraints on shipping

1628
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,484
或者你当时想到的显卡的局限性 
or the limitations of graphics cards of the day that you thought about,

1629
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,829
但不管是什么原因 都做不到？
but for whatever reason, couldn't do?

1630
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,890
戴夫·科尔彻：问题是有没有
DAVE KIRCHER: The question was was there anything

1631
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:57,590
我们在发货前出于各种原因没有追查的产品吗？
that we didn't pursue for various reasons before shipping?

1632
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:00,490
我什么都想不起来 
And I can't think of anything.

1633
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:03,310
我想我对我们制作的东西很满意 
I think I was pretty happy with what we produced.

1634
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,310
我关注的大部分东西都是错误
Most of the things I focused on were bugs

1635
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:09,607
我们发货是因为再一次回到发货模式 
that we shipped because once again, getting back into shipping mode,

1636
01:20:09,607 --> 01:20:11,440
当你离发货越来越近时 你
as you get closer to shipping something, you

1637
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,650
想要接触的代码越来越少 
want to touch the code less and less and less.

1638
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:18,340
即使你知道修复将100%奏效 它也肯定会奏效 
Even if you know that the fix is going to work 100%, it will definitely work,

1639
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,230
它可能会打破一些新的东西 
it might break something new.

1640
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:23,470
所以我当然有一个小小的清单 上面列出了我希望自己能解决的事情 
So I certainly have a small list of things that I wished I had fixed,

1641
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:24,860
但我并不希望...
but nothing that I wish I--

1642
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:27,050
观众：基本上 比如说 像粘性油漆这样的功能 
AUDIENCE: Basically, like, features like the sticky paint, for example.

1643
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,091
戴夫·科尔彻：是的 是的 
DAVE KIRCHER: Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:30,560
我想不出有什么特征
Yeah, I can't think of any features that--

1645
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,650
TEJEEV KOHLI：我们做了一些工作 
TEJEEV KOHLI: There's stuff that we worked on that

1646
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,090
很明显没有增加运输量
obviously didn't ed up shipping.

1647
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:36,400
其中一些我们在这里提到过 
Some of them we touched on over here.

1648
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,350
我不知道是不是因为
I don't know if sticky paint was something

1649
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,600
我们应该多花点心思
that we should have worked more on, though,

1650
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,930
因为我觉得我们花了很长时间才让它发挥作用
because I feel like we spent a lot of time trying to get it to work.

1651
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:47,500
当时削减它的理由现在仍然有效 
And the reasons for cutting it then are still valid now.

1652
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,380
所以我是说如果我们回去 我不认为
So I'm saying if we were to go back, I don't think

1653
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,190
我们会努力解决这个问题 
we would try to solve that problem.

1654
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:55,332
我们可能会想出新的问题来解决 
We'd probably come up with new problems to try to solve.

1655
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:57,040
我们试过另一种方法
We did have-- like another thing we tried

1656
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,640
我认为我们在游戏发布后尝试了它 就像DLC扩展一样 
was I think we tried it after the game shipped for like a DLC expansion was

1657
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,080
反光漆
reflection paint.

1658
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,000
因此 这是油漆 将反映不同的元素的游戏
So it was paint that would reflect the different elements of the games

1659
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,534
比如反射激光或者反射光桥 
like reflect lasers or reflect light bridges.

1660
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:11,950
但我们没能走得太远 
And we didn't get too far with it.

1661
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,781
同样 它导致了一堆奇怪的水平
Again, it leads to a bunch of weird levels

1662
01:21:14,781 --> 01:21:16,780
因为你必须让每一层都有角度 
because you have to have all levels have angles.

1663
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,988
因为如果你想想传送门 
Because if you think about Portal, most of the levels

1664
01:21:18,988 --> 01:21:20,950
像是90度的墙什么的
are like 90 degree walls and stuff.

1665
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:24,170
90度的反射无处不在 
And 90 degree reflections don't go anywhere.

1666
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,290
所以我们不得不
So we had to have--

1667
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,950
用这些奇怪的45度角制作这个超级人为的外观水平
make this super contrived looking levels with these weird 45 degree angles

1668
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,350
到处都是 它们可以反映事物 
everywhere and they can reflect things.

1669
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:35,230
然后所有的问题 好吧 多久一次 
And then all the problems like, well, how often--

1670
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:37,540
我们允许多少次反弹之类的 
how many bounces do we allow and things.

1671
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,360
还有一些东西看起来很奇怪 像拖拉机光束反射到
And also stuff just looked weird, like tractor beams reflecting off

1672
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,499
看起来很奇怪
of walls just looked weird.

1673
01:21:42,499 --> 01:21:45,040
可能还有其他的想法我现在记不起来了 
There's probably other ideas that I can't remember right now,

1674
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,180
但也有
but there are--

1675
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:52,030
他们中的很多人很快就被砍掉了 因为缺陷非常明显 
a lot of them get cut short pretty quick because the flaws are really apparent

1676
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:52,989
很快
pretty quickly.

1677
01:21:52,989 --> 01:21:55,280
你可能会坐下来想 哦 这是个好主意 
You might sit down and think, oh, this is a great idea.

1678
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,160
我要出去工作了 
I'm going to go out and work on it.

1679
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,030
然后当你开始通过它并与其他人一起测试它时 
And then as you start working through it and testing it out with others,

1680
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,320
你开始看到所有的问题 
you start seeing all the problems.

1681
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,509
这些问题很快就会显现出来 
And those problems get apparent pretty quickly.

1682
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:08,050
到了那个时候 你就可以打电话了 
And at that point, you make the call.

1683
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,790
就像 这不值得再追求了 
Just be like, this is not worth pursuing anymore.

1684
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:15,200
我们有更多的游戏模式 我们正在努力工作 
We had some more game modes we were trying to work on.

1685
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,949
我认为我们有一个竞争模式 我们工作了一点 
I think we had a competitive mode for a little bit we worked on.

1686
01:22:17,949 --> 01:22:20,740
戴夫·奇彻：我们实际上有一个关于这个的幻灯片 
DAVE KIRCHER: We actually have a slide about that for a little bit.

1687
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,920
它没有得到充实 
It didn't get fleshed out.

1688
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,689
但传送门出货后我们马上说
But after Portal shipped, we immediately said

1689
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:27,480
多人游戏是什么样子的？
to ourself what does multiplayer look like?

1690
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,830
所以我们首先尝试的是死亡竞赛 
And so the first thing we tried was deathmatch.

1691
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:31,207
事实证明这是一个可怕的想法 
Turns out that's a horrible idea.

1692
01:22:31,207 --> 01:22:33,790
每个人都想把传送门放在别人的脚下 
Everybody wants to just put portals under other people's feet.

1693
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:37,520
所以你大部分时间都是晕头转向 
So you spend most of your time just completely disoriented or confused.

1694
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,930
然后我想我们做了一个收集硬币有点像 
And then I think we made a collect the coins kind of like,

1695
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,060
哦 做一些狂欢之类的事情 
oh, do flings and things.

1696
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,268
但再一次 每个人都想把他们的门户网站
But once again, everybody wanted to put their portals

1697
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:45,430
踩在别人的脚下
under other people's feet.

1698
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:48,220
所以现在我们有了合作 
So now we have co-op.

1699
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,189
TEJEEV KOHLI：我认为合作社非常成功 
TEJEEV KOHLI: The co-op was very successful, I think.

1700
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:53,230
还有很多其他的挑战
And there's a bunch of other challenges that come

1701
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:56,720
我们必须解决的问题
with co-op that we had to work through.

1702
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,100
我认为 是的 我们尝试了一些不同的竞争模式 
I think, yeah, we tried some more different competitive modes.

1703
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,730
我们尝试了计时赛的模式 但他们是一起做的 
We tried a time trial kind of mode, but they're doing it together.

1704
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,950
但这实际上只是同时玩两个单人游戏 
But that's effectively just playing two single player games at the same time.

1705
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,270
所以没有太多的互动 
So there's not much interaction.

1706
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:10,870
任何时候你让玩家在《传送门》中以竞争的方式互动 
Any time you let players interact in a competitive way in Portal,

1707
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,703
他们只想把传送门装在脚上
they just want to put portals on their feet.

1708
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:14,840
这就是他们真正想做的 
That's really all they want to do.

1709
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,930
这是有趣的一点 但不是作为接收端 对不对？
It's fun for a bit, but not as the receiving end, right?

1710
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:20,980
这并不有趣--或者他们只是想继续撞对方的门户 
It's not fun-- or they just want to keep bumping each other's portals.

1711
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,980
就像他们想把传送门放在另一个人
Like when they want to put their portal at exactly where the other guy's

1712
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,680
波特尔群岛
portal is.

1713
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,830
就像他们走进来然后进去
Like they walk in and they go in there instead

1714
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:29,120
他们应该去的地方
of where they were supposed to go.

1715
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,170
暂时还挺有趣的 
It's fun for a bit.

1716
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,232
我不是说这没有价值 
I'm not saying there's no merit there.

1717
01:23:32,232 --> 01:23:33,910
戴夫·基尔彻：我想他说的“一点”是指大约五分钟 
DAVE KIRCHER: By "a bit," I think he means about five minutes.

1718
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,160
TEJEEV KOHLI：是的 通过“一点” 这就是你看到的东西 你就像 啊 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Yeah, by "a bit," that's the thing you look at, you're like, ah,

1719
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,820
真好笑 
that's funny.

1720
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,040
但后来你意识到没有真正的.
But then you realize there's no real--

1721
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,850
至少在我们尝试的机制中 它没有太多的深度 
at least in the mechanics we tried, there wasn't much depth to it.

1722
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,520
这不是你可以在游戏模式中充实的东西 
It's not something you could flesh out for a game mode.

1723
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,130
这更多的是你可以作为一个层次来做的事情--
It's more of something you could do as a level--

1724
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,960
曾经是个噱头 
as a gimmick once.

1725
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:55,060
但也没有太多理由这么做 
But then there's not much reason to do that.

1726
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,090
这样做的成本真的很高 所以你必须弄清楚
The cost of doing that is really high, so you have to figure out

1727
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,070
你想花一大笔开发工作吗
do you want to spend a bunch of dev effort

1728
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,440
在制作这个噱头的过程中 会有很多人
in making this gimmick that's going to get really old and lots of people

1729
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,180
会不会感到恼火或沮丧？
are going to get annoyed or frustrated?

1730
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,040
所以你不能这么做 
So you just don't do that.

1731
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,626
就在后面 
In the back there.

1732
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,116
观众：你提到你可以缓存一些东西--
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that you could cache some stuff--

1733
01:24:11,116 --> 01:24:14,602
一些照明场景正在酝酿之中--
things in the pipeline for some of the lighting plots--

1734
01:24:14,602 --> 01:24:15,598
早些时候 
earlier.

1735
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:18,586
我想知道有没有其他类型的硬件黑客
I'm wondering if there were any other kind of hardware hacks

1736
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:24,580
这样做是为了保持门户行为所需的目标？
that you do in order to keep the targets that you want for the portal behavior?

1737
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:29,140
戴夫·科尔彻：所以这个问题提到了一些管道是如何存在的
DAVE KIRCHER: So the question references how there were some pipeline

1738
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,670
对像素查询的限制 
restraints on the pixel queries.

1739
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,420
如果要达到性能要求 我们必须进行任何黑客攻击 
And if there were any hacks that we had to do to meet performance,

1740
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,290
我相信是的 
I believe yes.

1741
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:37,998
TEJEEV KOHLI：还有我们做过的任何其他事情 
TEJEEV KOHLI: And any other stuff we did.

1742
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:40,750
戴夫·科尔彻：再一次 我将
DAVE KIRCHER: Once again, I'm going to have

1743
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,000
说我在10年前做了大部分这样的事情 
to say that I did most of this stuff 10 years ago.

1744
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,979
我脑子里想不出任何东西来 
I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

1745
01:24:45,979 --> 01:24:47,020
并不是很多 
There wasn't a whole lot.

1746
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,770
TEJEEV KOHLI：我们做了油漆方面的工作 
TEJEEV KOHLI: We did stuff with the paint.

1747
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:51,670
我不知道我们是不是做了一堆黑客 但有一次
I don't know if we did a bunch of hacks, but one

1748
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,759
我们在油漆上做的大破解之一就是你所看到的油漆
of the big hacks on the paint that we did was the paint that you're seeing

1749
01:24:55,759 --> 01:24:57,550
不是画这幅画的油漆 
is not the paint that's doing the painting.

1750
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,800
所以我的意思是 就像 没人知道 
So I mean that's, like, nobody can tell.

1751
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,120
那真是太好了 
That's pretty good.

1752
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:08,470
但尤其是在多人游戏中 客户看到的油漆
But especially on multiplayer, the paint that the client is seeing

1753
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,530
不是服务器看到的油漆 
is not the paint that the server is seeing.

1754
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,750
因为我们无法传输所有的数据 
Because we couldn't transmit all that data,

1755
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,880
因此 它们都在生成自己的数据 
so they're both generating their own data.

1756
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,550
但是 服务器是唯一真正进行绘画的人 
But then the server is the only one doing the actual painting,

1757
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:22,139
因此 客户端在世界上遇到的所有斑点都不会执行任何操作
so all the blobs that the client is hitting in the world do nothing

1758
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:25,430
服务器斑点进行绘制 然后告诉客户端在那里进行绘制 
and the server blobs do the painting and then tell the client paint over there,

1759
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,040
在那边画画 
paint over there.

1760
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,740
所以这是一种事情--因为网络带宽相当有限
So that's the kind of thing-- because the network bandwidth is pretty limited

1761
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:33,640
世界上有很多颜料在飞舞 
and there's a lot of paint flying through the world.

1762
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,760
所以我们不能一直把所有的油漆都传输出去 
So we couldn't just transmit all the paint all the time,

1763
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,160
所以它们都会生成自己的油漆 
so they all generate their own paint.

1764
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,490
遍及世界的斑点 然后是画
Blobs that are through the world, and then the painting

1765
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,190
它本身发生在服务器上 然后它被传输 
itself happened on the server and then that gets transmitted.

1766
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:48,837
但在空气中飞舞的油漆对每个人来说都是不同的 
But the paint flying through the air is different on everyone,

1767
01:25:48,837 --> 01:25:50,920
但它的随机性很强 你真的看不出来 
but it's random enough that you can't really tell.

1768
01:25:53,276 --> 01:25:55,980
观众：《半条命3》会有门户吗？
AUDIENCE: Is Half-Life 3 going to have portals?

1769
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:58,359
TEJEEV Kohli：我不知道 
TEJEEV KOHLI: I don't know.

1770
01:25:58,359 --> 01:25:59,400
戴夫·柯尔彻：无可奉告 
DAVE KIRCHER: No comment.

1771
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,035
[笑声]
[LAUGHTER]

1772
01:26:01,035 --> 01:26:03,010
大概不会吧 
Probably not.

1773
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:06,470
严肃地说 在最初的门户网站问世后 
In all seriousness, after the initial Portal came out,

1774
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:09,940
另一个实验不仅是多人游戏的样子 
one of the other experiments was not only what does multiplayer look like,

1775
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,325
但在半条命的环境中 这有多有趣呢？
but how fun is this in a Half-Life environment?

1776
01:26:13,325 --> 01:26:17,350
事实证明 半条命的制作方式 
And it turns out that the way that Half-Life is made,

1777
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:22,057
有一大堆略微照本宣科的序列可以让事情运转起来 
there are a whole lot of slightly scripted sequences to make things work.

1778
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:23,890
因此 这些级别的设计方式是
And so the way those levels are designed are

1779
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:25,930
与门户级别完全不同
fundamentally different than Portal levels

1780
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,790
它们基本上就会分解 
and they basically just break down.

1781
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:30,910
因此 如果《半条命》中有传送门 那么《半条命》
So if there were portals in Half-Life, then Half-Life

1782
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:34,060
看起来更像门户网站 
would seem a lot more like Portal.

1783
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:37,150
TEJEEV Kohli：如果你考虑门户级别 它是相当受限制的 
TEJEEV KOHLI: If you think about a Portal level, it's pretty constrained.

1784
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,890
视线是相当有限的 
The sight lines are pretty constrained.

1785
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,930
这一关发生在一个盒子里 
The level takes place in a box.

1786
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:42,260
你看不到很远 
You can't see really far.

1787
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:46,130
墙壁上有很多弯折 所以你看不到尽头 
There's a lot of kinks in the walls so you can't see all the way to the end.

1788
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,320
半衰期水平完全不是这样设计的 
Half-Life levels aren't designed like that at all.

1789
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,880
所以你只需要进入一个关口 做一个通向出口的入口
So you would just go in a level and make portals all the way to the exit

1790
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,550
然后跳过所有的游戏 
and then skip all the game play.

1791
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,950
我的意思是 可能有MODS允许你这样做 
I mean there are probably mods that allow you to do that,

1792
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:02,050
但我认为游戏本身和机制从根本上来说
but I think the games themselves and the mechanics are fundamentally

1793
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,470
差异足够大 我认为他们的互动不是很好 
different enough that I don't think they interact really well.

1794
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,720
除非他们两个都改变或者其中一个改变
Unless both of them change or one of them

1795
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,530
变化很大 所以它不再是你想要的游戏 
changes a lot so it's no longer the game you wanted.

1796
01:27:14,297 --> 01:27:15,380
我想你是第一个上台的 
I think you were up first.

1797
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:16,390
嗯 
Yeah.

1798
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:19,766
观众：你提到过你做了一个学生游戏项目
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that you had done, like, a student game project

1799
01:27:19,766 --> 01:27:21,642
在你被Valve雇用之前？
before you got hired by Valve?

1800
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:24,449
那里的故事是什么？
What was the story there?

1801
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:27,490
TEJEEV Kohli：所以问题是关于我们的学生游戏项目 
TEJEEV KOHLI: So the question was asking about our student game projects.

1802
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:34,560
所以戴夫工作了--我们都去了雷德蒙德的一所名叫DigiPen的学校 
So Dave worked-- we both went to a school in Redmond called DigiPen.

1803
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,830
戴夫在我之前去过那里 
Dave went there before I did.

1804
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:38,140
戴夫·科尔彻：我是2005年毕业的 
DAVE KIRCHER: I graduated in 2005.

1805
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,900
我参与了一个叫纳巴卡拉投掷的游戏 
I worked on a game called Narbacular Drop.

1806
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,750
如果你在谷歌上搜索 这将是唯一的结果
Which if you Google for it, it will be the only result

1807
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:47,836
因为这个名字的选择是为了让它成为谷歌上唯一的搜索结果 
because the name was chosen so that would be the only result on Google.

1808
01:27:47,836 --> 01:27:49,210
如果你会拼写 祝你好运 
If you could spell it, good luck.

1809
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:54,550
这就是我们在DigiPen的高级项目--
And so that was our senior project at DigiPen--

1810
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,030
我当时的团队 
my team at the time.

1811
01:27:56,030 --> 01:28:00,547
所以我们结束了一个非常错综复杂的长篇大论
And so we ended up through a very convoluted long story showing

1812
01:28:00,547 --> 01:28:02,380
在Valve 他们当场雇用了我们
that at Valve, and they hired us on the spot

1813
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,661
基本上为他们重新创造了这些机制 
to basically recreate those mechanics for them.

1814
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,660
这实际上是--没有太多
And that was actually-- there wasn't a whole lot

1815
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:10,701
当时的信心 这将实际发货 但它成为门户网站 
of confidence at the time that would actually ship, but it became Portal.

1816
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:12,379
因此 这似乎是一件好事 
So it seemed like a good thing.

1817
01:28:12,379 --> 01:28:14,920
TEJEEV Kohli：是的 我是制作“标签”的团队的一员 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Yeah, and I was part of a team that made "Tag--

1818
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,890
我用喷漆枪展示的视频《油漆的力量》
The Power of Paint," the video I showed with a paint gun, and that

1819
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:22,480
是我们团队在DigiPen的初级项目 
was our team's junior project at DigiPen.

1820
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,290
同样的事情 Valve看了几次
And same thing, Valve saw it a couple of times

1821
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:32,320
并雇佣了整个团队来为Valve的那个机械师工作 
and hired the entire team to come work on that mechanic at Valve.

1822
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,920
一旦我们到达那里 就很明显地要尝试将它整合在一起
And then once we got there, it became obvious to try to integrate it

1823
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,310
进入传送门2 这就是我们如何开始在传送门2上工作
into Portal 2 and that's how we start working on Portal 2

1824
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,851
这就是传送门2凝胶的起源 
and that's how the Portal 2 gels came about.

1825
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:49,483
观众：《传送门2》中作为机械师介绍的油漆和凝胶
AUDIENCE: The paints and gels which were introduced as a mechanic in Portal 2

1826
01:28:49,483 --> 01:28:52,440
最终也成为了故事的一部分 
ended up being part of the story as well.

1827
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,850
你能谈谈一些机械师是如何影响故事的吗？
Can you talk about how some mechanics end up affecting the story

1828
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:59,149
以及故事元素最终是如何影响机械的？
and how story elements end up affecting the mechanics?

1829
01:28:59,149 --> 01:29:02,190
TEJEEV Kohli：问题是故事和游戏机制是如何
TEJEEV KOHLI: The question was about how the story and the game mechanics

1830
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,580
互动以及一个人如何影响另一个人 
interact and how one affects the other.

1831
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,190
所以至少在传送门2 我认为传送门1非常相似 
So the way at least in Portal 2, and I think Portal 1 was very similar.

1832
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:14,610
它与Valve的工作方式是 我们不是真的
The way it kind of works with Valve is we don't really

1833
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:19,620
在我们开始之前 为游戏设计文档做一个总体设计 
have an overarching design for a design doc for the game before we start.

1834
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,850
我们尝试用类似的技术把很多小东西组合在一起
It's a lot of smaller things that we try to combine using similar techniques

1835
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,610
就像我们今天讨论的那样 
like what we discussed today.

1836
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:31,530
而这个故事有点像是在使用相同的技术来构建我们 
And the story kind of builds us out of using the same techniques.

1837
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:35,430
因为我们审查大多数设计决策的方式
Because the way we kind of vet out most of our design decisions

1838
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,890
是通过游戏测试 
is by play testing.

1839
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:43,080
故事遵循了一个非常相似的情节 但你并不真的想要一个--
And the story follows a very similar plot but you don't really want one--

1840
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,610
任何一个都不能覆盖另一个 
either one to override the other.

1841
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:50,100
因为如果你看了比赛 比如我做了一大堆--
Because if you see the game, like if I make a bunch--

1842
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,530
如果我们有一个团队制作了一堆拼图
if we have a team that made a bunch of puzzles

1843
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:55,750
对于这款游戏来说 这款游戏还没有经过充分的测试 
for the game that haven't been very play tested.

1844
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:58,382
然后编剧走进来 为它写了一大堆东西
And then the writer comes in and does a bunch of writing for it

1845
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:01,590
然后三周后 你意识到有一半的水平没有发货
and then you realize three weeks later that half these levels aren't shipping

1846
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:04,470
再也没有了 因为他们考试不好 然后
anymore because they didn't test well, then

1847
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:07,980
您创建了一大堆不起作用的依赖项 
you made a bunch of dependencies that didn't really work.

1848
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:13,200
门户是幸运的 因为拼图本身是被隔开的
Portal was lucky in that the puzzles themselves are compartmentalized

1849
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,369
当你进入电梯时 
as you enter the elevator.

1850
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:17,160
或者你走出电梯 做一个拼图 然后进入电梯 
Or you exit the elevator, you do a puzzle, and enter the elevators.

1851
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,560
所以他们都是被划分得很小的 
So they're all pretty compartmentalized.

1852
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:25,320
而且很多为它写的文章基本上都是笑话 
And a lot of the writing that was done for it was essentially just jokes.

1853
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:31,890
因此 这些笑话中的许多确实适用于大多数谜题 
So a lot of those jokes do fit in to most of the puzzles.

1854
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:35,640
因此 谜题可以改变 笑话可以插入其中 
So the puzzle can change and the joke can just be inserted into it.

1855
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,340
但对于这场比赛的核心故事来说 
But for the overarching story of the game,

1856
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:41,340
我认为这需要更多的合作 
I think that required a lot more collaboration.

1857
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,564
所以编剧们都在现场 
So the writers were on-site.

1858
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:46,230
他们是Valve的员工 他们坐在同一个房间里
They were Valve employees and they were sitting in the same room

1859
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:50,460
当我们看着我们玩测试 来回跳跃的想法 
as us watching us play test, bouncing back and forth ideas.

1860
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:53,760
我们使用--我们在游戏的大部分时间里都使用GLaDOS 
And we used-- we had GLaDOS for most of the game.

1861
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,980
而配音艺人是当地人 所以我们让她来了很多次
And the voice artist was local, so we had her come in many times

1862
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,510
录下一大串台词 
and record a bunch of lines.

1863
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:04,810
我们还在网上使用了一些类似于假机器人的声音 
We also used some like fake online robot voice for a while,

1864
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:07,560
但这些都很难判断 因为游戏测试者几乎
but those are hard to judge because the play testers almost

1865
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,240
不要因为这些笑话而发笑 
never laugh at those jokes.

1866
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,600
因为机器人总是不知道如何说这些话 
Because the robot always doesn't really know how to speak them.

1867
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,426
但它听起来像个机器人 所以它不是 总比什么都没有强 
But it sounds like a robot so it's not it's better than nothing.

1868
01:31:16,426 --> 01:31:19,050
这比仅仅在屏幕上显示文本要好得多 我们还
It's better than just putting text on the screen, which we also

1869
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,407
有一段时间是这样 
did for a while.

1870
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:23,490
所以在写作中 有两件事是你想测试的 对吗？
So with the writing, there's two things that you're trying to test, right?

1871
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:26,900
你在试着测试这个人的笑话 而且有很多
You're trying to test out the individual's jokes, and a lot of them

1872
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,660
可以运输到任何级别 
can be transported to any level.

1873
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,140
因此 他们不会过度依赖于这些水平 
So they're not super dependent on the levels.

1874
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:33,067
但一旦故事开始发展起来
But then once the story starts coming together

1875
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:36,150
并开始成形 在这一点上 你正在改变水平
and starts taking shape, at that point you're making changes to the levels

1876
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,680
以适应这个故事 
to accommodate the story.

1877
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,070
从那时起 你必须有相当大的信心
And from that point on, you have to have a pretty good amount of confidence

1878
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,810
这些特定的关卡将在游戏中发布 
that these particular levels are going to ship in the game.

1879
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:47,070
因此 我认为这种情况开始发生的时间相当晚
And so that that starts happening I think fairly late

1880
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:49,482
至少进入我们的开发周期 
into our dev cycle at least.

1881
01:31:49,482 --> 01:31:50,940
总有一个压倒一切的目标 
There's always an overarching goal.

1882
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,330
总有一个目标是你想要抓到韦奕礼
There's always a goal of you're trying to capture Wheatley

1883
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:59,520
或者你正试图杀死GlaDos 但这是如何发生的
or you're trying to go kill GLaDOS, but the exact mechanics of how that happens

1884
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,880
直到相当晚的时候才走到一起 
doesn't come together until fairly late.

1885
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,940
因为你不想花很多时间去整合
Because you don't want to spend a bunch of time integrating

1886
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:09,480
你的故事和你的水平没有一堆自信
your story and your levels without having a bunch of confidence

1887
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,350
这些级别实际上是足够好的 可以运输 
that these levels are actually good enough to ship.

1888
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,810
这是我们在游戏中的一大部分 
Which we do have for a bunch of the game,

1889
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:18,770
但随着新水平和新机制的引入 
but as new levels and new mechanics are being introduced,

1890
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:22,000
这一切都有点失控了 
it all kind of goes haywire.

1891
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,070
因此 这主要是一个相当强大的协作过程
So it's just mostly a pretty strong collaborative process

1892
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,220
在作家和设计师之间 以及这一切之间
between the writers and the designers and it all

1893
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,819
回到话剧测试 
goes back to the play testing.

1894
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:38,306
听众：你能谈谈你是如何
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little bit about how

1895
01:32:38,306 --> 01:32:42,194
声音与门户互动 就像在3D定位中一样
the sound interacts with portals, like in 3-D positioning

1896
01:32:42,194 --> 01:32:44,150
音频源的？
of the audio sources?

1897
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:48,080
戴夫·科尔彻：所以问题是声音如何与门户网站互动 
DAVE KIRCHER: So the question was how sound interacts with Portal.

1898
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,810
我的记忆有点模糊 
And my memory's a little fuzzy.

1899
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,150
我非常肯定我们尝试过复制一点 使用
I'm pretty sure we tried to replicate a little bit using

1900
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,850
这只是一个简单的解决方案--基本上与我们的照明方案完全相同 
just a simple-- basically the exact same solution as with our lighting.

1901
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:58,370
这就像我们在门户前有一个样本点 我们
Where it's like we have a sample point in front of a portal and we

1902
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:59,786
在另一边安装一个发射器 
have an emitter on the other side.

1903
01:32:59,786 --> 01:33:01,730
我不记得我们是不是那样装船的 
I can't remember if we shipped that way.

1904
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:02,390
TEJEEV KOHLI：我想我们做到了 
TEJEEV KOHLI: I think we did.

1905
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:03,181
戴夫·科尔彻：是的 
DAVE KIRCHER: Yeah.

1906
01:33:03,181 --> 01:33:05,950
TEJEEV Kohli：我认为有一个麦克风或游戏中的麦克风
TEJEEV KOHLI: I think there's a microphone or in-game microphone

1907
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:09,732
在两边的门户上都有一个游戏中的扬声器 
and an in-game speaker on the portals on both sides.

1908
01:33:09,732 --> 01:33:11,690
所以如果你在传送门的这一边 你会
So if you're on this side of the portal, you'll

1909
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,364
听听另一边发生了什么 
hear what's happening on the other side.

1910
01:33:14,364 --> 01:33:15,780
我很确定我们就是这么装船的 
Pretty sure that's how we shipped.

1911
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,540
戴夫·科尔彻：是的 但我不认为我们有什么特别的让步
DAVE KIRCHER: Yeah, but I don't think we made any special concessions

1912
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:20,280
让它看起来像是在穿过隧道或类似的东西 
to make it seem like it was going through a tunnel or anything like that.

1913
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,120
我们只是想确保你能听到发生了什么 
We just wanted to make sure you could hear what was going on.

1914
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,245
TEJEEV Kohli：不是专门通过门户网站 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Not through the portals specifically.

1915
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:27,910
我知道我们为拖拉机光束做了一堆东西 
I know there was a bunch of stuff we did for the tractor beam.

1916
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:29,660
就像当你走向拖拉机光束时 它
Like when you head to the tractor beam, it

1917
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:35,692
这会让你周围的一切变得模糊 也会让声音变得有点混乱 
kind of fuzzles everything else around you and muddles the sound a little bit.

1918
01:33:35,692 --> 01:33:37,400
但是通过入口本身 
But going through the portals themselves,

1919
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,600
我不认为我们在那里做了什么特别的事情 
I don't think there's anything specific we did there.

1920
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,600
至少我不能--已经很长时间了 
At least not that I can-- it's been a long time.

1921
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,100
戴夫·科尔彻：好久不见了 
DAVE KIRCHER: It's been a long time.

1922
01:33:47,303 --> 01:33:49,251
观众：有哪些益智游戏的例子？
AUDIENCE: What were examples of puzzle games

1923
01:33:49,251 --> 01:33:53,650
当你制作游戏的时候 你受到了什么启发？
that inspired you when you making your games?

1924
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:55,062
TEJEEV Kohli：嗯 门户网站 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Uh, Portal.

1925
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:57,392
[笑]
[LAUGHING]

1926
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,602
问题是 是什么益智游戏启发了我们
The question was, what puzzle games inspired us

1927
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:01,810
当我们在做游戏的时候？
when we were making our game?

1928
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:08,350
戴夫·科尔彻：我想不出有什么强烈的灵感 
DAVE KIRCHER: I can't think of a strong inspiration.

1929
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:12,512
我主要是一个程序员 所以我没有做很多实际的拼图设计 
I'm mostly a code guy, so I didn't do a whole lot of the actual puzzle design.

1930
01:34:12,512 --> 01:34:15,220
但当我回想起来 我们没有太多的消息来源
But when I'm thinking back, we didn't have a whole lot of sources

1931
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:21,160
可以借鉴 因为总的来说 这是一个相当新的概念 
to draw on because it was a fairly new concept in general.

1932
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,990
我想不出任何我所依赖的消息来源 
I can't think of any sources I drew on.

1933
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,570
我是说
I mean--

1934
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:28,120
TEJEEV Kohli：我说的门户网站不是开玩笑的 
TEJEEV KOHLI: I wasn't kidding when I said Portal.

1935
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,010
当我们制作TAG的时候 我想门户网站已经推出了一年
When we were making Tag, I think Portal had come out a year

1936
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:37,034
在那之前的一两年里 它真的很好 取得了巨大的成功 
or two earlier before that and was really good and a big success.

1937
01:34:37,034 --> 01:34:38,950
我们试着学习他们是如何
And we were trying to learn from how they were

1938
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,539
教球员们不同的东西 
teaching the players different things.

1939
01:34:40,539 --> 01:34:42,580
这是我们从一个
And that's one of the biggest things we took away

1940
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:47,320
在我们的学生游戏中 你如何教玩家不同的机制？
in our student game was how do you teach players different mechanics?

1941
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,810
我认为门户网站做得很好 
And I think Portal did a really good job of that.

1942
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:53,320
通过做而不是展示来教学 
By teaching by doing instead of by showing.

1943
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,510
就像球员们做所有的事情 
So like the players doing all the stuff and then

1944
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:57,594
而不是让别人看一段视频
figuring it out instead of someone showing a video

1945
01:34:57,594 --> 01:35:00,593
或者只是告诉玩家 嘿 这是你接下来要做的 然后去
or just telling the player, hey, here's what do you do next, and then go

1946
01:35:00,593 --> 01:35:01,300
做这些事
and doing that.

1947
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,850
所以我们试着把它放在心上 当我们
So we tried to take that at heart, and as we

1948
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:07,060
在我们的游戏中引入了新的颜料和新的机制 
were doing in our game introducing new paints and new mechanics,

1949
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:09,820
我们用同样的方式来介绍它们
doing it the same way where we introduce them in a way

1950
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:13,204
使用方法足够明显 玩家会尝试它 
that the usage is obvious enough that the player will try it out.

1951
01:35:13,204 --> 01:35:16,120
当他们尝试它 它的工作 他们感觉真的很好 
And when they try it out and it works, they feel really good about it.

1952
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,245
因为他们觉得是他们自己想出来的而不是我们来做所有的工作
Because they feel like they figured it out instead of us doing all the work

1953
01:35:19,245 --> 01:35:21,130
告诉他们该怎么做
and showing them what to do.

1954
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:27,410
所以很多这类的东西都是我们从门户网站上拿来的
So a lot of that kind of was a specific thing that we took from Portal

1955
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:28,770
并尝试在我们的游戏中做到这一点
and trying to do it in our game.

1956
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:35,026
观众：《传送门》 这两款游戏需要多少人来创作
AUDIENCE: How many people did it take to create these two games, Portal

1957
01:35:35,026 --> 01:35:38,530
和传送门2 在不同的功能单元--
and Portal 2, across the different functional units--

1958
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:42,530
发展 作家 和其他人 
development, writers, and the rest?

1959
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,840
TEJEEV KOHLI：所以问题是有多少人
TEJEEV KOHLI: So the question was about how many people

1960
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,620
制作《传送门》和《传送门2》的关键
it took to make Portal and Portal 2.

1961
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:52,220
传送门1在很大程度上是一个相当小的团队 
Portal 1 was a pretty small team for the most part.

1962
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:56,002
戴夫·基尔彻：所以《传送门2》一开始是由七个人负责的--
DAVE KIRCHER: So Portal 2 started as the seven people that worked on--

1963
01:35:56,002 --> 01:35:56,960
一号传送门 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Portal 1.

1964
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,890
戴夫·奇彻：是的 
DAVE KIRCHER: Yeah.

1965
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:02,840
抱歉传送门1一开始
Sorry, Portal 1 started with the seven people

1966
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,870
直接移植到Narbacular Drop上
that worked on Narbacular Drop directly transplanted.

1967
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:09,560
然后我们很早就开始和两个作家合作 
And then we started working fairly early with two writers.

1968
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,290
我们利用Valve的其他人
And we were leveraging other people at Valve

1969
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:15,260
回答问题 帮助我们尽快
to answer questions and help us hit the ground running as far

1970
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,670
如何使用引擎 
as how to use the engine.

1971
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:20,840
但主要是那九个人每天工作 
But it was mostly just those nine people working day to day.

1972
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,580
然后传送门2膨胀了很多 
And then Portal 2 ballooned quite a bit.

1973
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:25,470
TEJEEV Kohli：传送门2是一支更大的球队 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Portal 2 was a much bigger team.

1974
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:30,050
到我2009年加入Valve时 我认为已经有了
By the time I joined Valve in 2009, I think there was already

1975
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,260
一支相当庞大的门户2团队 
a pretty big Portal 2 team.

1976
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,700
他们已经有了机械师计算出的领域 
They already had a field the mechanics figured out.

1977
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,660
这场比赛和你现在看到的完全不同 但在那个时候
The game was pretty different from what you see now, but at that point

1978
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:42,560
可能已经有10到12个人了 
it was already maybe 10, 12 people.

1979
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,010
然后喜欢它慢慢增加 
And then like it slowly increased.

1980
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:49,190
就像我们有四五个人被雇来玩我们的彩绘游戏 
Like we were four or five that got hired for our paint game.

1981
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,390
所以我们加入了那个团队 
So we joined that team.

1982
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:53,060
然后我想 到最后 可能会有
And then I think by the end of it, there were probably

1983
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,780
有近四五十个人在做这件事 
close to 40, 50 people working on it.

1984
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:02,210
那是在接近尾声的时候 因为我们必须在两台游戏机和PC上发货
That was towards the very end because we had to ship on two consoles and PC

1985
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:05,060
我们有一个完整的合作社机械师 
and we had a whole co-op mechanic.

1986
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:08,020
有一个单独的合作组织活动
And there was a whole co-op campaign be worked on separately

1987
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:10,770
以及一名单人球员 
as well as a single player one.

1988
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,770
所以在比赛结束时 这是一支相当强大的球队 
So it was a pretty big team by the end of it.

1989
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:14,640
比1号传送门大得多 
Much bigger than Portal 1.

1990
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,170
而且我认为游戏本身也比传送门1大得多 
And the game itself I think is much bigger than Portal 1 as well.

1991
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,630
我认为单人竞选本身很可能是
I think the single player campaign itself is probably

1992
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,740
两倍多的时间 
more than twice as long.

1993
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:26,950
而这场运动--合作组织的运动可能也有那么大 
And the campaign-- the co-op one is probably also that big.

1994
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:30,200
Dave Kircher：我记得在门户1中 我们必须进行频繁的整合
DAVE KIRCHER: I remember in Portal 1 we would have to do frequent integration

1995
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,030
测试 我想我在门户1上的播放时间缩短到了45分钟
testing and I think I got my play time on Portal 1 down to like 45 minutes

1996
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:36,330
2号门有几个小时的路程 
and Portal 2 is several hours.

1997
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,660
TEJEEV KOHLI：是的 
TEJEEV KOHLI: Yeah.

1998
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,520
所以这是一个更大的游戏 所以它需要更多的人 
So it's a much bigger game, so it took a lot more people.

1999
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,030
观众：你使用的游戏引擎和Unity相比怎么样？
AUDIENCE: How does the game engine that you used compare to Unity?

2000
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:50,650
它是更直接的从头开始的C编程 
Is it more straight-up C programming from scratch,

2001
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:53,687
或者是你看到的很多拖放式的东西？
or is it a lot of the drag-and-drop stuff you see?

2002
01:37:53,687 --> 01:37:56,020
TEJEEV Kohli：所以问题是我们的游戏引擎是如何
TEJEEV KOHLI: So the question is how did our game engine

2003
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,462
请比较一下像“团结”这样的东西 
compare to something like Unity.

2004
01:37:58,462 --> 01:38:02,870
对于门户和门户2 我们都使用了源 
For both Portal and Portal 2, we used Source,

2005
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,340
这是我们内部的游戏引擎 
which is our in-house game engine.

2006
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:08,900
这与Unity的工作原理有很大不同 
And it's very different from how Unity works.

2007
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,640
因此 Unity的工作方式很像一个真正的大编辑 
So the way Unity works is mostly like a really big editor.

2008
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:16,520
就像你在编辑器中看到的一样 本质上就是游戏 
Like what you're seeing in the editor is the game essentially.

2009
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,430
就像所有的实体和东西都加载了一样 
Like all the entities and stuff are loaded.

2010
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:20,474
显然 一次装载更多的东西 
Obviously more stuff gets loaded at one time.

2011
01:38:20,474 --> 01:38:22,390
但你所看到的就是你所得到的 
But what you're seeing is what you're getting.

2012
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:27,390
而源代码的工作方式是它有一堆这样的离散工具
Whereas the way Source works is it's got a bunch of these discrete tools that

2013
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,117
制造一些东西 
make stuff.

2014
01:38:28,117 --> 01:38:30,700
所以有一个关卡编辑器 你可以在那里设置关卡 
So there's a level editor, which is where you make your level.

2015
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:35,080
然后你把它导入到游戏中 然后你单独运行游戏 
And then you import that into the game and you run the game separately.

2016
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:38,320
你在关卡编辑器中看到的并不是你在游戏中看到的
And what you're seeing in a level editor is not what you see in the game

2017
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,910
因为很多实体和东西不会翻译给编辑 
because a lot of the entities and stuff don't translate to the editor.

2018
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,860
很多照明和材料都必须预先烘焙 
A lot of the lighting and stuff has to be pre-baked.

2019
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:48,680
Unity也有一些预烘焙的照明 
Unity has some pre-baked lighting as well.

2020
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,690
但在源码中 它的工作方式--
But in the way it worked in Source--

2021
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:55,330
我认为源代码是一系列离散工具的组合
Source I think is a combination of a bunch of discrete tools

2022
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:57,580
对于这场比赛的每一个不同方面 
for each different aspect of the game.

2023
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:00,520
所以我有一个单独的粒子编辑器 单独的模型编辑器 
So I get a separate particles editor, separate model editor,

2024
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:08,370
VO和Face Poser的单独编辑器 以及单独的关卡编辑器 
separate editor for VO and the face poser, and the separate level editor.

2025
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:11,890
然后有一个游戏引擎 它接受所有的编译版本--
And then there's a game engine that takes the compiled versions of all--

2026
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:15,040
编译所有这些内容的输出 然后将它们放入游戏引擎
compiled outputs of all those things and then puts them in the game engine

2027
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,660
并将它们结合在一起 
and combines them together.

2028
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,530
然后所有的代码几乎都是C++ 
And then all the code is pretty much exclusively C++.

2029
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:23,060
我不认为真的有什么其他的 
I don't think there's really anything else.

2030
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:26,620
可能有几件事不是 
There might be a couple a handful of things that are not,

2031
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:29,980
但是所有的工具都是C++ 
but all the tools are C++.

2032
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:34,720
所有的游戏引擎 所有的运行时代码都是C++ 
All the game engine all the runtime code is all C++.

2033
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:40,420
来源2有点不同 但在这方面仍在向前发展 
Source 2 is a little bit different, but still going forward on that front,

2034
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,970
我不想做Unity正在做的事 
I'm not trying to do what Unity's doing.

2035
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:47,390
因为Unity更像是你的运行脚本--
Because Unity is more of your running scripts--

2036
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:52,480
C#脚本--然后您只需在编辑器离开时编译它们
C# scripts-- and then you're just compiling them while the editor's going

2037
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,760
以及快速迭代之类的东西 
and the rapid iteration and stuff.

2038
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,450
来源并不是真的有相同的工作模式 
Source doesn't really have that same model of working.

2039
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:02,110
但好处是我们控制了一切
But the advantage is that we control all of it

2040
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:06,400
然后是我们能生产的产品的上限
and then the ceiling for what we can produce

2041
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,620
从理论上讲是相当高的 
is theoretically quite a bit higher.

2042
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,320
因此 这是有权衡的 
So there's tradeoffs to it.

2043
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:16,770
此外 我们所有的工具和引擎材料都是在内部生产的
And also we make all our tools and all our engine stuff in-house

2044
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:19,999
我们是我们游戏的主要客户 
and we're the primary customer for our games.

2045
01:40:19,999 --> 01:40:21,790
所以我们并不想做你所做的
So we're not trying to do what you Unity is

2046
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:26,560
为任何想要制造任何东西的人服务并努力为他们服务 
doing and trying to service to anyone out there who wants to make anything.

2047
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,340
Unity有成千上万的人在修理他们的发动机
And Unity has thousands of people working on their engine

2048
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:36,120
而且我们有相当多的小数量级 
and we have quite a few orders of magnitude less.

2049
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,530
但我认为我们意识到了我们正在进行的所有权衡 
But I think we are aware of all the tradeoffs we're making.

2050
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,850
我们并没有试图不去做他们正在做的事情 
We're not trying not to do what they're doing.

2051
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,410
我们只是在看--我们也在向他们学习 
We're just seeing-- and we're learning from them, too,

2052
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:50,500
《源码2》从诸如Utility和Things之类的东西中得到一些启示
and Source 2 has taken a few cues from stuff like Utility and stuff

2053
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,980
就像虚幻一样 
like Unreal.

2054
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:57,340
努力对我们自己的客户、内部员工变得更友好 
Trying to be more user friendly even to our own customers, internal employees.

2055
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,130
但这并不像...
But it's not like--

2056
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:02,570
在源头和统一之间 工作方式是非常不同的 
the way of working is very different between Source and Unity.

2057
01:41:10,786 --> 01:41:13,310
我觉得我们很好 
I think we're good.

2058
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:15,573
好的 再次感谢你邀请我们 
All right, well, thanks again for having us.

2059
01:41:15,573 --> 01:41:18,870
[掌声]
[APPLAUSE]

2060
01:41:20,022 --> 01:41:21,980
科尔顿·奥格登：非常感谢你们的到来 
COLTON OGDEN: Thank you all so much for coming.

2061
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,729
所以外面有一些多余的披萨 但那是门户网站的问题 
So there's some extra pizza outside, but that was Portal Problems.

2062
01:41:24,729 --> 01:41:26,790
所以非常感谢你们 
So thank you very much.
