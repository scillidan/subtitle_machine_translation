00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,850
COLTON OGDEN: All right.

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,580
Welcome to Lecture 9 of GD50.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,970
Today's topic is Dreadhalls.

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,400
So last week we ventured into Unity, our
first foray into 3D, and not only 3D,

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,460
but also just getting
our heads and hands

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,690
around the Unity game engine,
which is among Unreal and others

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,450
sort of the most popular game
engines in use for 2D and 3d games.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,740
And last week we did sort of a
2.5D style helicopter game whereby

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,910
everything was in 3D, but we were still
aligning things based on just two axes,

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,060
the x and the y, I believe,
possibly the z and the y.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,660
I don't remember, but two
axes versus three axes.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,310
Today we'll actually be diving into
using all three axes available to us

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,160
in Unity 3D in the context
of a game called Dreadhalls.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,895
And so what Dreadhalls is--

15
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:11,190
it was a VR game,
actually the first VR game

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,230
that I ever played on the Oculus,
the gear VR, Samsung Gear VR.

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,107
And it pits you in sort of
this dark and eerie 3D maze

18
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:21,940
where you don't really
know what's going on.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,861
And you can go around
and get collectibles

20
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,860
and encounter creatures
and stuff as you can see

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,130
in the bottom right screen shot there.

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,130
Today's example is going
to be a little simpler.

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,450
But it allows us to explore things
like procedural maze generation

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,120
and first person camera control.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,140
So last week recall we were using
sort of a third person camera

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,750
whereby we were sort of
far back on the scene.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,030
Today we'll actually be
using a first person camera

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,800
where the camera is effectively
our eyes as if we were

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,270
walking around in the maze ourselves.

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,610
Unfortunately, we won't be using
a VR demonstration this week,

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,110
but next week I hope to put
together sort of a VR sampling

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,510
using this project so we
can see how this works in VR

33
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,812
and how Unity's toolkit works in VR.

34
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,770
So some of the topics
we'll be covering today--

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,180
we'll be talking about texturing.

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,259
So recall last week the helicopter
and all of the items in our game

37
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,966
were just sort of flat colors.

38
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,340
They didn't really have any
texture associated with them.

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,010
We'll talk about how to
assign textures to materials

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,780
and how to apply those materials
to objects in our scene.

41
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,490
We'll talk about materials and
lighting, so not only materials but also

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,710
the different kinds of lights that Unity
supports and a few details about those.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,880
We'll talk about, again,
3D maze generation,

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,046
so we'll have a simple but effective
algorithm for creating a 3D data

45
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:39,420
structure to represent our
level as opposed to previously

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,870
where we had just a
tile map that we could

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,150
generate to give us the
appearance of walking around

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,740
in some sort of 2D world.

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,880
Now we'll actually perform a similar
operation on Data, a 2D array.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,850
But we'll take that array and
we'll actually create 3D blocks

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,000
and create a maze that we can
walk through in 3D space, which

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,400
is kind of fun and interesting.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,300
Last week we only had one scene in
our game, which was just a play scene.

54
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,600
And even though we had like a
game over state within that scene,

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
we didn't transition between scenes.

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,080
We just sort of reloaded the same scene.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,180
Today we'll have a title
screen and a play scene, which

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,080
is an evolution of the
idea that we had in LOVE 2D

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,609
where we had a state machine that was
governing our entire game in terms

60
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,900
of the different states that
we could be in, whether it

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,170
was the title, the game over,
the play state, and so forth.

62
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,310
Unity does the same thing with
scene objects, which are effectively

63
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,460
a snapshot of a series
of game objects aligned

64
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,100
in a particular way in the editor.

65
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,220
We'll talk about fog
and also global lighting

66
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,260
and certain other things
that allow us to create

67
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,380
a atmosphere conducive
to the sort of feel

68
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,530
that we want to get in our game today,
which is sort of creepy and eerie.

69
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,100
And lastly, when we talk about how
to create UI elements in the game,

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,590
we'll talk about Unity 2D, its
canvas object, and text labels

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,057
and some other things and
how those all operate,

72
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,890
which is sort of two
sides of the same coin.

73
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,220
Unity 3D also comes
bundled with Unity 2D,

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,880
a set of tools used to make not only 2D
games but also 2D interfaces that you

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,730
can apply to your 3D games.

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,720
So first, a demo.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,910
Now I've been sick for
the last week, so I'm not

78
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,120
going to ask for anybody to come
up and demo just because I don't

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,370
want to get anybody
else sick, so I'm going

80
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,660
to just go ahead and show,
just this lecture, the game

81
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,350
that I put together for you.

82
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,720
So here I have two scenes.

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,090
Notice here I have a title
scene and a place scene.

84
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm in the Unity editor right now.

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,852
I'm going to load up the title
scene here, which I've done.

86
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:40,560
And then notice that it has sort
of a game view and a scene view.

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,794
I'm going to hit play.

88
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:44,460
We're going to make sure that
it's set to maximize, which it is.

89
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,980
And so we have sound here,
so we should hear audio.

90
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,890
And hit play.

91
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,310
And notice that we have sort of
like this ambient creepy music track

92
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,600
playing.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,200
We have a very-- we could have
easily done this in LOVE 2D.

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,640
This is just a black screen
with two text labels on it.

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,230
And this is done with
Unity's 2D UI toolkit.

96
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,096
And so it says--

97
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:08,220
it tells us to press Enter.

98
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,990
So if I press Enter, We instantly
get teleported into like this maze,

99
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,490
this creepy looking maze.

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,220
And so I can walk around in this maze.

101
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,960
And there are a few things going on.

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,870
So anybody-- can anybody
tell me some of the things

103
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,630
they notice about the scene,
what jumps out at them?

104
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,730
What are some of the elements?

105
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,470
If you were to put this together
yourself, where would you start?

106
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,553
What are the pieces that
we can put together here?

107
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:41,700
Yes.

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,300
Yep.

109
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,841
There has to be a ground that
you can stand on, and there is.

110
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:52,380
So we're generating not only
walls in our scene, of course,

111
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,020
but we need a ground to sit in.

112
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,190
And also if you look up top,
it's kind of difficult to tell,

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,970
but we also have a ceiling so
ground and the ceiling and walls.

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,110
Some kind of lighting.

115
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,160
Yes.

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,580
And so in this case, we're
actually using ambient world

117
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,780
lighting as opposed to
having a light source.

118
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,090
So we'll take a look at that.

119
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,680
In last week's lecture, we used--

120
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,559
two weeks prior's lecture, we
used a directional light object.

121
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,600
But in this case, we have
no lights in the scene.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,590
We're actually using
Unity's world lighting,

123
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,923
which we'll take a look at soon.

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,140
When we walk around, notice
that I can move where

125
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,610
my camera is looking with my mouse.

126
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,550
So we're actually controlling the camera
with a first person controller, an FPS

127
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,980
controller, which is actually a
component that Unity provides to you.

128
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,280
And then notice eventually if
we keep exploring the maze,

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,010
we come across this little thing
here, which is sort of a pickup.

130
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,690
And when we pick this up, we
get like this weird creepy piano

131
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,355
sound and then the scene reloads.

132
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:02,520
Does anybody notice anything
about what we see in the distance,

133
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,040
like how that's affected?

134
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,210
Like if I'm looking at
this wall right here,

135
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,940
for example, it's kind
of hard to tell, but as

136
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,712
opposed to like down this hallway,
what's the difference there?

137
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,282
AUDIENCE: The light source
is further away, I guess.

138
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:21,240
COLTON OGDEN: The light
source is further away.

139
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,750
Kind of.

140
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,480
So what we're experiencing
here-- we're seeing it's

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,520
a graphics sort of concept called fog.

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,230
And so what fog lets you do
is it effectively adds color

143
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,680
to the scene based upon how far
away the objects are in the scene

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,550
and multiplies color onto them.

145
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,130
And it gives you the
illusion of looking--

146
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,550
as if you're surrounded
by fog basically.

147
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,210
And it's been around for a very long
time, back even as far as the N64 days.

148
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,390
And we'll talk about that later today
and it's actually incredibly easy

149
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,500
to add that into a game with Unity
and its world lighting system.

150
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,530
Any idea as to how fog, not
only in terms of aesthetics,

151
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,763
but how it could maybe
help with performance?

152
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,162
Yeah.

153
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:12,700
AUDIENCE: Don't need as much
pixel clarity because it's already

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,670
[INAUDIBLE].

155
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,260
COLTON OGDEN: You don't
need as much pixel clarity.

156
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,000
Kind of.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,080
The big thing about fog and the way
that it was used a long time ago

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,380
is that, because eventually
things are completely

159
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,620
opaque beyond a certain point, you don't
need far draw distance in your game.

160
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,059
So you can actually
like dynamically-- you

161
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,730
can omit rendering things that
are a certain distance away

162
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,730
because you wouldn't be
able to see them anyway.

163
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,919
And so this was an optimization
technique used a lot back

164
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,060
when draw distance was a
huge bottleneck on computers

165
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,510
and game video game consoles
back in the 90s for example.

166
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,147
Like Silent Hill, the game for
PS1, was almost exclusively fog.

167
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:53,980
And you can see very
little in front of you.

168
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,070
And we'll see a
screenshot of that later.

169
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,770
And they use that to
boost their performance

170
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,045
and also to provide a certain aesthetic.

171
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,420
And then one other thing you
might be paying attention to

172
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,500
is there's a sound on a loop, just sort
of this creepy sort of whispering sound

173
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,000
and that's to just add atmosphere.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,760
Right.

175
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,140
Just because without it, we would--
it's little things like that, especially

176
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,140
in horror games like this, the
atmosphere can be everything.

177
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,140
So with very simple ideas, fog, some
whispers, first person controller,

178
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,270
so you have tight hallways, you can
produce something that's pretty scary.

179
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,190
Now there are a few
things missing from this,

180
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,180
namely there's nothing that's going
to come at you and attack you.

181
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,570
But it would be not
terribly difficult to add,

182
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,824
but because we're using
procedural generation,

183
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,490
you would need what's called a nav mesh.

184
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,115
And you would need to generate
that procedurally so that things

185
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,682
could follow you in 3D space.

186
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:48,390
We might have some time to talk
about how to do that a little bit

187
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,860
later today, but that's not
implemented in this particular lecture.

188
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,790
But it would be not too
infeasible to accomplish.

189
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,120
But those are some of the pieces
that we'll take a look at today.

190
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,230
So this is the title scene.

191
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,230
Notice that there's not a whole lot
here actually, so if I zoom back out,

192
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,410
we can see canvases
are huge in Unity just

193
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,320
because it's more optimized for
the engine to render them that way.

194
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,910
But we can see, even though it's a
2D UI, it's very visible in 3D space.

195
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,650
And if you click this button
here, we end up getting--

196
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,150
oh, no.

197
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,950
That just brings us into-- sorry.

198
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,340
Click this button here.

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,770
That brings us into
the 2D Unity 2D mode.

200
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,060
So now we're interacting
with things in 2D.

201
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,600
And I can actually click on
this label and move it around

202
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,962
in 2D as if we were using a 2D game
engine as opposed to a 3D game engine.

203
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,670
So we'll look at that
a little bit later.

204
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,470
This is just the title scene.

205
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,060
So the play scene itself--

206
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,295
I'm not going to save that.

207
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:51,690
The play scene itself--

208
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,910
I'm going to go from
2D back to 3D here--

209
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,480
is pretty much empty.

210
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,390
So we have a first
person controller here.

211
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,440
This is the FPS controller object.

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,400
Does anybody-- anybody tell what
basically constitutes an FPS controller

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,219
just by looking at the scene here?

214
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,260
What are some of the pieces
that jump out at you?

215
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,142
AUDIENCE: I thought you just put
the camera right where the player is

216
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,850
or right in front of the player.

217
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,190
COLTON OGDEN: Exactly.

218
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,690
You put the camera right where
the player is, effectively

219
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,960
where your head should be
relative to where their body is.

220
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,630
And their body-- what's
constituting their body here?

221
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,555
Can you tell?

222
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:33,770
AUDIENCE: It could just be a-- it
looks like a cube in the middle there.

223
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,936
COLTON OGDEN: It's actually
this capsule right here.

224
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,590
I don't know if you can see it.

225
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,490
There's this capsule
here, this green capsule.

226
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,670
It's a little bit more organic
feeling than a cube necessarily,

227
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,800
but you could use a cube as well.

228
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,990
But a capsule is how character
controllers in Unity are represented.

229
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,680
And character controllers come for
free in Unity, which is really nice.

230
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,270
They're part of the standard assets.

231
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,030
So if you go to import
package, in Unity--

232
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,460
if you go into Assets,
Import Package, there's

233
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,850
a lot of packages that come for
free that sort of bootstrap you.

234
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,090
Notice there's like 2D packages,
the cameras, characters.

235
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,890
The characters package has 3D
characters or third person characters,

236
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,260
first person characters,
some that are physics based,

237
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,820
some that are not physics based.

238
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,130
This particular
controller is not physics

239
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,830
based, meaning that we
don't apply forces to it.

240
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,040
We move it around.

241
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,850
It's kinematic.

242
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,610
It is affected by gravity, so in a
sense it kind of is physics based,

243
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,140
but it's not strictly physics based like
a rigid body and a rigid body would.

244
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,030
And the collisions that occur
between this and another rigid body

245
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,070
aren't the same as they
would be if we were

246
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,550
to make this a purely rigid
body based character controller.

247
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,396
There is a purely rigid body
based character controller

248
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,770
that you can import-- haven't
experimented with it a lot,

249
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,770
but you could probably figure out a
good use for that in terms of a game

250
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,120
or maybe you want to move precisely on
surfaces that have different materials,

251
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,150
like icy surfaces or
whatnot, and have it apply it

252
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,390
in a very physically realistic way.

253
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,980
And a few things that we
have here in our play scene--

254
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,027
we have a dungeon generator object.

255
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,360
So this dungeon generator
object is just an empty object

256
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,730
with a level generator script here.

257
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,970
And then we have a few other objects,
a floor parent, a walls parent,

258
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,680
and a whisper source.

259
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,220
So we'll get into the details
of what all of those mean.

260
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,810
Our goal today will be
talking about a few things.

261
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,537
So we'll be talking about--
here's a picture of just our maze.

262
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,870
So we talked about some of
those things at a high level.

263
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,920
We'll actually explore how to implement
them in Unity today, so making a maze,

264
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,210
making the fog effect, walking through
it with our character controller.

265
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,940
We want to be able to have
some kind of game play here,

266
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,410
so we have collectibles in
the form of this red coin.

267
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,370
This is actually part of another
standard assets pack, the prototype

268
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,300
assets pack.

269
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,350
It comes with a prototype little
coin object that you can throw in.

270
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,800
Anybody notice anything about
this coin beyond the fact

271
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,350
that it's just a red coin?

272
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,063
What else do you know it's
about this scene here?

273
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,570
AUDIENCE: It's emitting a glow.

274
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,028
COLTON OGDEN: It's emitting a glow.

275
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:03,844
Any ideas as to how
it's emitting a glow?

276
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,810
AUDIENCE: There's a light
source inside of it?

277
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,650
COLTON OGDEN: There's a
light source inside of it.

278
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,490
Exactly.

279
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,570
So we'll talk about that.

280
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,153
We'll show you how that's implemented.

281
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,450
Very easy to do in Unity.

282
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,000
And then we'll also talk about, towards
the end, our 2D scene, our title scene,

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,820
and how to construct it, which
is actually very easy in Unity

284
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,830
as opposed to doing something by code.

285
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,500
You very rarely actually
for interfaces need to touch

286
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,810
code, at least in terms
of how to lay them out.

287
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,870
In Unity you can do everything
very visually and with the mouse.

288
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,260
Actually, it's a pleasure
to make interfaces

289
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,110
if you're used to just
making them in code.

290
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,870
So texturing-- so last week or two
weeks ago, we did nothing with textures.

291
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,830
Well, that's not true.

292
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,170
We had one texture on
the background, which

293
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,850
was the sort of scrolling background.

294
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,820
But we didn't really
look at that too much.

295
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,800
In today's example, you know
the helicopter and the coin

296
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,180
and the buildings and
all that stuff, those

297
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,160
were all just polygons with flat
colors associated with them.

298
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,770
Today we'll be talking about how to
actually texture things with materials.

299
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,280
And so this is very easy to do in Unity.

300
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,640
So I'm going to go
over to my title scene

301
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,612
here, just because it's lit in a fairly
normal way as opposed to the play

302
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,820
scene, which is not lit in
a normal way because we're

303
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,450
using environment lighting.

304
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,600
We don't have a sky box.

305
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,010
The title scene has a fairly
normal lighting set up.

306
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,630
So if I add a cube
here to the scene, you

307
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,500
can see right off the bat by
default we do get a material here,

308
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,350
which has what's called
an albedo component.

309
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,740
Albedo just means like what's
its surface color look like.

310
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,346
It has a much more technical definition.

311
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,470
And you can look up on
Wikipedia what albedo means.

312
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,340
It has something to do with the way
that light interacts with surfaces.

313
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,050
There's a lot of other elements here.

314
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,899
You can make something look metallic.

315
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,440
You can make it look smooth or rough.

316
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,990
And you can also add
normal maps, height maps,

317
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,110
and a few other things, which gives
it more of like a bumpy texture,

318
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,260
and so forth.

319
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,860
And you can also make
things emit light this way,

320
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,710
which the coin actually not only emits
light but also is a light source.

321
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,730
So it does both.

322
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,290
And there's a few other things here.

323
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,800
For example, let's say you have a
very large cube and a small texture.

324
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,900
If you put a very small
texture on a large cube,

325
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,108
what's it going to look like?

326
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:27,710
What's your instinct?

327
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,876
What if we have a very large
cube, but a very-- like

328
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:34,354
say we have a 64 by 64 pixel
texture, but our cube is humongous?

329
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:36,270
What effect is that going
to have on the cube?

330
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,330
It's going to look kind of
like an N64 cube, right?

331
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,390
What basically happens is it's going
to interpolate between the texture

332
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,500
pixels, the texels when you
apply a texture to your cube.

333
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,050
And so when you apply a small
texture to a large surface,

334
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,090
it's going to look stretched.

335
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,100
It's going to look stretched.

336
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,586
It's going to look also filtered as like
you sort of see in some YouTube videos

337
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,210
if you watch them and they're
recorded a very small resolution,

338
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,109
but you blow them up.

339
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,119
They look filtered or
if you've ever stretched

340
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,530
a picture in the right software and
it looks interpolated in a filter,

341
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,450
it's going to have that look.

342
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,520
So what you can do is
you can apply tiling.

343
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,339
So here we can see there's
a tiling element x and y.

344
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,020
So a one in the x and y
direction, because it only

345
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,900
applies on a flat surface.

346
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,960
So the effect of tiling would be such
that if you have a 64 by 64 texture,

347
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,007
you could just tile that texture
several times to get the desired

348
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,090
look that you want on
whatever surface that you're

349
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,590
trying to look at in your game world.

350
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,990
Maybe it's a very small object
or maybe it's a very large object

351
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,073
that you're looking at as
a character and you want

352
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:47,050
to tile bricks for example or stone.

353
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:57,640
So to apply a texture to a 3D object in
the scene, I'm going to go into here.

354
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,517
So you need a material first.

355
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:02,350
And so these are all
Unity material objects.

356
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,270
You can tell because
they have a circular--

357
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,102
they all look like as if they've
been wrapped around a sphere.

358
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,310
These are all Unity materials
as opposed to textures.

359
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,880
Textures are just 2D objects,
2D textures, 2D images.

360
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,420
So this is part of an asset
pack that I downloaded

361
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:23,290
for this lecture called low poly dungeon
modules, which is in the asset store.

362
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,650
And so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to apply--

363
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,570
let's say I want to just apply
this rock material to this object.

364
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,069
Right.

365
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,545
Then I go over to that.

366
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:33,790
I'm going to first add a--

367
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:40,550
I think because I went into the
material it had a incorrect appearance.

368
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,040
So do that.

369
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,587
Oh, that's strange.

370
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm going to create a new scene.

371
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,480
And then I'm going to
add a cube and then a--

372
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,370
not pop but maybe the beam.

373
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,770
I wonder why it is not--

374
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,810
that's very strange.

375
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,685
For some reason, it
might be a setting that I

376
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:08,570
have enabled that's not
allowing it to correctly render.

377
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,710
But the effect of that should
be that we apply-- normally

378
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:19,030
if you apply a texture
to a material, it'll

379
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,360
have the effect of creating--
it'll instantly texture it.

380
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,390
But what I can do is I
can go to textures here.

381
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,770
And this should work too.

382
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,260
I can go to that and then
it'll apply it that way.

383
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,570
So normally, if you're in a fresh
project and you add a new 3D object,

384
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,150
and you just click and drag
a material onto a 3D object,

385
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,770
it will texture it for you.

386
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,810
In this case, I think
because it's automatically

387
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,590
assigning a material to these
objects based on some project setting

388
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,820
that I off the cuff just unable to--

389
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,080
I don't know for sure--

390
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,080
you can instead just go to
the albedo component here.

391
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,190
So albedo functions not only as a color
but also as a texture for your object.

392
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,430
And so you can apply a
texture, just a 2D image,

393
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,680
to your albedo component of a material.

394
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,280
Right.

395
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,720
And that will have the same effect
as texturing it immediately.

396
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,520
So normally what this is supposed
to do is create a albedo--

397
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,330
create a new material with
that texture as the albedo when

398
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,110
you set a material to the 3D object.

399
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,800
Now I wonder if I--

400
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,849
Yeah.

401
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,390
I'm not sure.

402
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,199
I'm not sure exactly why it
didn't work like right off the bat

403
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,490
like it's normally supposed to.

404
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,900
In a fresh project, it will.

405
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,980
I'll try to investigate.

406
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,070
But if it ever happens like that
where for some reason you're--

407
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,940
I think it has to do with the
way the shaders are set on here.

408
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,770
Maybe there's a setting
I'm just not sure about.

409
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,990
But you can just set the
albedo component here manually.

410
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,860
It'll have the same effect.

411
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,810
So the albedo component of your
material, setting that with a texture,

412
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,580
textures objects.

413
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,720
And so that's effectively how
we get from this sort of look

414
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,550
of a flat shaded or flat color
shaded object to a texture shaded

415
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,000
object just like that.

416
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,350
And texture mapping in itself is a
very wide field and fairly complicated,

417
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,470
but ultimately it looks
something like this.

418
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,690
So does anybody-- can anybody
tell me what this looks like here?

419
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,750
So we see here obviously we
have a fully textured model.

420
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,410
But if we're looking at this, what
does it look like we've done here?

421
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,330
So what does it look like?

422
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,580
Ignore all the lines.

423
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,145
But what does it sort of
look we have on the surface?

424
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:49,100
It's just a texture, right?

425
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,600
Oops.

426
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,750
We can sort of see the colors here.

427
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,170
For example, maybe his
belt here or actually that

428
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,700
looks like the top of his head here.

429
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,872
This being the top of his head, and then
we have like his belt and other things.

430
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:04,080
This right here, we can pretty clearly
see that's like sort of his face mask,

431
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,580
right?

432
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,700
But it's just on a 2D surface,
like this is a regular texture.

433
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,260
And so what we've done
here is basically taken

434
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,290
all of the polygons that comprise the
model and laid them out flat, right?

435
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,520
Lay them out flat as if on
a table where our texture is

436
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,970
and that's what UV mapping is.

437
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,340
And this is usually something that you
do in whatever 3D modeling software

438
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,150
that you're using.

439
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,990
In Unity, when you apply a texture to a
material, or a material with a texture

440
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,840
to an object, it will use its standard--

441
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,640
it has its own built
in mapping algorithm

442
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,130
that will apply material to a model.

443
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,800
And so it does it differently
for different objects.

444
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,330
We can create like a sphere for example.

445
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,530
Move the sphere over here.

446
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,450
And I'm going to try again and just
to see if applying the material

447
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,260
works on that.

448
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,760
No.

449
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,630
It doesn't.

450
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,850
So applying a-- so if
we go into this material

451
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,760
here, which is, for
some reason, grayed out.

452
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,960
New scene again.

453
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,710
Create a new 3D sphere.

454
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:34,261
And then oh, this time it looks
like it's-- oh, I can't tell.

455
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:34,760
No.

456
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,968
I don't think that's working.

457
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,050
Oh.

458
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,450
Now it allows us to accept a texture.

459
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,200
OK.

460
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,370
So we can apply a texture.

461
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,870
Whoops.

462
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,070
Can apply a texture to that.

463
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,089
And so now we can see our
sphere has been mapped as well.

464
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,380
And it looks fairly convincing.

465
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,421
It's been wrapped around
in a way that it doesn't

466
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,400
look too distorted or too weird.

467
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,340
And so Unity has its own ways of
mapping for its primitive objects,

468
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,070
whether it's spheres, cubes, we have
a few other ones, capsules, cylinders,

469
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,049
planes.

470
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,090
It'll depend, obviously,
on what your texture is.

471
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,680
If your texture is fairly ornate,
it might end up looking distorted.

472
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,230
But for most purposes, for simple
primitive objects, for most textures

473
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,430
it should work pretty well.

474
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,470
Now if you imported a model that
was like a table or a character

475
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,790
and you just applied a texture to
it, it's not going to look good.

476
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,380
It's going to look messed up.

477
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,790
And so your 3D software
will export a material

478
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,380
with the model assuming
that you've modeled

479
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,280
in that software with a texture.

480
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,830
It'll actually give you a
material that you can then

481
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,330
reference that will properly
apply a texture to your character,

482
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,910
but the same sort of
apply a texture, just

483
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,250
a regular texture to
a complicated model,

484
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,850
just isn't going to work because it
hasn't been UV mapped in a smart way.

485
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,330
Unity's not going to
know I have a table.

486
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,430
I want to map the texture to the
table in a way that looks convincing.

487
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,920
You can see this kind
of if we create a cube.

488
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,130
And then if we go ahead and--

489
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,950
been making apparent for some reason.

490
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,350
If we go up here, I'm
going to first assign--

491
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,850
OK.

492
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,610
For some reason that worked instantly.

493
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,570
But you can see we've applied
a sort of wall texture to it.

494
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,300
And then if we scale it down-- so
this is the scale button up here.

495
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,280
You can move, rotate things.

496
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,200
If unfamiliar, these top buttons
up here are transform operators.

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,010
So you can move things, rotate
things, and scale things.

498
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:53,630
So if you scale this along this
y-axis a bit and then you zoom in,

499
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,520
the texture looks pretty
compressed and distorted,

500
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,691
because it's just doing
the same algorithm

501
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,440
and assuming it's the
same kind of surface

502
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,680
without taking into consideration
how it's been warped.

503
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,430
Right.

504
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,830
So ideally you wouldn't have
this flattening happening.

505
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,820
And so in your 3D software,
you would unwrap your model

506
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,670
and then apply a texture to each
separate polygon of your model

507
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,482
in a way that looks convincing.

508
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,440
And so this isn't anything
that you necessarily

509
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,510
have to do for the lectures, or for
the demonstration for your project.

510
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,700
But if you are creating your own 3D
assets, if you're importing 3D assets,

511
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,340
and if you want to use textures
in a way that we're doing today,

512
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,750
you will need to probably become
familiar with UV wrapping, UV

513
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,940
unwrapping, UV mapping in whatever
software that you're using.

514
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
And if you're just
unfamiliar with it in general

515
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:53,540
and have wanted to know what goes
on in turning a flat white polygon

516
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,946
character into something
that has a texture,

517
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:57,320
this is effectively what happens.

518
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,710
You unwrap it, make it
flat, sort of like stamp

519
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:07,670
the material onto it effectively,
and that maps the UVs of the texture,

520
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,710
so the texture's virtual
coordinates to your 3D model.

521
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,670
So any questions as to
how this works at all

522
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,368
or about unity and applying textures?

523
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:28,140
AUDIENCE: What's the general way that
you make the textures on the right

524
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,307
where it's like a world
that's been flattened?

525
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,640
COLTON OGDEN: How do you make
the textures on the right?

526
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
I mean that's kind of
an art form in itself.

527
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,810
You do have to do it by hand and know--

528
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,810
I mean, there's a good
amount of trial and error

529
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,360
that will go into it, too,
as you're making your model

530
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
and unwrapping it and
noticing, oh, this looks weird,

531
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,210
as I am applying this
polygon to the surface.

532
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,490
I'm going to go ahead
and change that texture.

533
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,020
But you could use any-- you could
use Gimp or Photoshop or any standard

534
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,722
texture creation software and just--

535
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,180
it's something-- I don't do a
lot of it, but it's something

536
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,388
that I imagine that you just
get better at with time.

537
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:12,390
And texture artists and modeling
artists probably develop sort of like

538
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,960
an attuned sense of what makes a
good texture versus what doesn't.

539
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,480
Generally, you'll make the model first
and then you'll make the texture.

540
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,400
OK.

541
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,100
So we already talked a
little bit about models--

542
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,810
sorry, about materials.

543
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,710
We'll go back over it
really briefly again.

544
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,320
There is a resource
that I really like and I

545
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,260
think does a really
wonderful job of teaching far

546
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,190
beyond the basics of Unity.

547
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,820
And that's catlikecoding.com,
and it's totally free.

548
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,800
They just have a bunch of free articles
on there which are very in-depth.

549
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,550
And this is a screen shot
taken from one of the articles

550
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,880
where they talk about how to make
really interesting materials.

551
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,655
So you can see here,
this one of the left,

552
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,780
it looks very-- you know,
it looks like a fireball,

553
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,310
like it's made out of magma.

554
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,480
And it's got bumps on it.

555
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,482
It has contour you can see that there's
sort of like a glow to the fire on it.

556
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:13,190
On the right, you can
see that this model

557
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,730
has sort of conditional
shine on certain parts of it.

558
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,960
Like the metal part of it is
shiny but the rest of it isn't.

559
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,550
And so how do we make certain
parts of the material shiny?

560
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,680
How do we make certain parts of it flat?

561
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,150
The article goes in depth on that.

562
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,870
Effectively what they do is
they use several layers of maps,

563
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:36,050
like a shininess map, which
is a texture that tells you--

564
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,500
that you reference in a Unity
custom shader that you write,

565
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,750
which the article
teaches you how to write.

566
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,610
Which will make certain parts of
the texture glossy and certain parts

567
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,744
of it not glossy, so matte.

568
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:51,410
And so you can do a lot of really
cool, very interesting things,

569
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,450
and Unity's shading system is very--

570
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,790
sort of the sky is the limit.

571
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,230
Because it's effectively a standard
shader language like you would--

572
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,330
it's effectively the same
thing as HLSL, I believe,

573
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,100
which is High Level Shading
Language which is a--

574
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,850
if I'm not misremembering--

575
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,920
Microsoft originally
came up with it, and it's

576
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,422
very similar to GLSL, which is
the open GL shading language.

577
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:16,880
And so what these are, effectively,
is just little programs

578
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,171
that run on your graphics card.

579
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,910
We talked about this before.

580
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,540
But they tell your scene
how to process lighting

581
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,520
for the objects that are within it.

582
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,610
And everything in Unity has
a shader associated with it,

583
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,555
even if it's just the standard shader,
which by default is just a white color.

584
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,430
But you can write your
own shaders and you're

585
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,610
capable of virtually
unlimited possibility.

586
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:45,020
And this effectively is all a
shader, and it's all a shader

587
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,910
that's been written in code.

588
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,800
But we have a lot of these
variables that are exposed to us,

589
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,570
and albedo is one of them.

590
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,310
And albedo is sort of conditional.

591
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,350
If it gets a texture applied to it,
it will just render that texture.

592
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,150
But if you apply color to it, it will
apply that color to your material.

593
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,280
And so that's how you can
get, you know, textured

594
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,080
things versus non-textured things.

595
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,587
Metallic just computes shininess
and reflectivity off of surfaces.

596
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:15,920
And that's just something
that's written into the shader

597
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,400
and produces the lighting
responsible to make that happen.

598
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,850
And all of these different things
are just part of a single shader.

599
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,520
And a material is effectively a shader.

600
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,870
They're kind of one in the same.

601
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,703
A material is a little
bit different in that

602
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:32,760
you can also specify how its surface
should interact with other things.

603
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,320
So for example, if
you're in an ice level,

604
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,040
a material can not only be like the
sort of glossy, icy look of something,

605
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,160
but also, how slippery is
it when I walk over it?

606
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,070
And should I slide?

607
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,540
And how should other things
interact with it that have physics?

608
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,620
So those two hand-in-hand are
sort of what a material is.

609
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,390
But likely, as you're starting
out the only real things

610
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,100
that you'll need to consider--

611
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,980
and you're sort of bound
only by your curiosity--

612
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,610
our albedo and maybe
metallic, and maybe emission.

613
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,670
And then depending on how much
you-- how big your thing is

614
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,670
and how small your
texture is, maybe tiling.

615
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,730
And then recall last week
we manipulated offset.

616
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,250
So offset is how much the
texture is shifted, and recall it

617
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,250
loops around back to the other side.

618
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,040
And so by manipulating
offset on the x-axis,

619
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,740
we were able to get an infinitely
scrolling texture, right?

620
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,320
And so all of these
things have their uses.

621
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,810
And pretty much everything
in Unity has its uses.

622
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,441
It's a very vast toolkit to use.

623
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,940
But those are probably the
important things that you'll see.

624
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,340
And this article and many
others on this website,

625
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,580
which I highly recommend if you're
looking to get really deep into Unity,

626
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,380
will give you a lot of insight into how
things work far beyond just the surface

627
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,060
level there.

628
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,500
So any questions on materials?

629
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,669
All right.

630
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,460
So we're going take a
look now at lighting.

631
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,890
So materials are one
part of the equation.

632
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,240
So that sort of defines how things
should look when light hits them,

633
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,590
but we also need light itself in
our scene to illuminate things.

634
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,830
And so this is taken from another
article on Catlike Coding on rendering.

635
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,160
And so this is a scene
with a lot of lights, a lot

636
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,470
of glowing lights, emissive lights.

637
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,130
And there's a lot more
going on here, but this

638
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,580
is another great series of articles
on how to understand the lighting

639
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,010
model in Unity.

640
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,250
And it teaches you a lot.

641
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,726
It teaches you almost down to
the very bare ingredients of the,

642
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,600
sort of, the software and the
rendering, if you want to go that deep.

643
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,840
I certainly haven't gone
through every article

644
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,590
because there's a tremendous amount
of content and it's very deep.

645
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,130
But if you're looking to really
get a sense of how it works,

646
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,850
I would encourage you to explore that.

647
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,210
So we'll look at a few
different types of lighting.

648
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,230
Beyond the more complicated things
that this article talks about,

649
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,810
we'll look at the different styles
of lights, which you'll probably

650
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,870
use more often as you're starting out.

651
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,190
So point lights.

652
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,590
Anybody have an idea as to what a point
light might be based on this picture?

653
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,259
AUDIENCE: Pointing in a
very specific direction?

654
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,800
COLTON OGDEN: It's not pointing
in a very specific direction.

655
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,760
That's actually a spotlight.

656
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,710
So a point light is a source of
light that actually shoots out

657
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,130
in all directions around it.

658
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,540
So it emits light in all directions,
but within a confined area,

659
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,880
at a specific intensity.

660
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,000
A spotlight shines light
in a specific direction.

661
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
So only one direction.

662
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,989
And what's interesting about
spotlights is you can actually

663
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,330
apply what's called a cookie to them.

664
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,679
And what a cookie does, very similar
to what the Batman light does,

665
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,230
it allows you to apply
a texture to a light

666
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,929
and therefore cast shadows,
specific shadows, on the light.

667
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,739
So if you wanted to make
something like the bat signal,

668
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,350
you could put the Batman icon
cookie on your spotlight.

669
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,314
And that will shine a
light, but the Batman logo

670
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:57,480
will be in the middle of it.

671
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,990
It's effectively the same thing
as taking a literal spotlight

672
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,530
and putting a object onto it.

673
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,405
It produces a shadow.

674
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:05,460
A manual shadow.

675
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,910
AUDIENCE: It's called a cookie?

676
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,576
COLTON OGDEN: It's called a cookie, yep.

677
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,050
A directional light.

678
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,070
Does anybody know what
a directional light is?

679
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,493
So despite its name, it's actually
not the same thing as a spotlight.

680
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,220
So directional light-- we used a
directional light last week, actually.

681
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,300
Last lecture.

682
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,050
Directional light casts
light in a single direction,

683
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,530
but throughout the entire
scene, as if it's the sun.

684
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,220
So this allows us to illuminate
globally the entire scene,

685
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,350
but all light gets cast
from one direction.

686
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,000
So if you want to produce the
appearance of daylight in your scene,

687
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,020
just a single directional light
will illuminate everything.

688
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,222
And then the last thing, which is
used less, is called an area light.

689
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:56,430
So does anybody know-- can
anybody guess what an area

690
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,110
light is based on this picture here?

691
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,310
Yes.

692
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,650
AUDIENCE: It's light
that's only on the surface?

693
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,990
COLTON OGDEN: Light that's
only on the surface.

694
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,070
Kind of, yes.

695
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,740
So it's light that will
emit from the surface

696
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:21,040
of a specifically-designated rectangle,
effectively, in one direction.

697
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,360
So you can define a large area.

698
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,870
For example, maybe you want like a
wall strip in your game or something

699
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,694
on the wall to emit light specifically
to the left or something like that.

700
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,360
That's what an area light is capable of.

701
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,940
Now, area lights are
computationally expensive,

702
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,649
and so you can only use them
when you bake your lighting.

703
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:44,440
Does anybody remember what baking
means when referring to lighting?

704
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,600
So baked lighting just means that,
instead of real-time lighting,

705
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,350
calculating things dynamically,
the light gets calculated one time

706
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:01,285
and saved, and almost like freezed
onto all of the objects in the scene.

707
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,910
And so there are pros and cons to this.

708
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,094
What's a pro to baked
lighting, do we think?

709
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,010
AUDIENCE: It's less
computationally intensive.

710
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,884
COLTON OGDEN: Less
computationally intensive.

711
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:15,630
What's a downside to baked lighting?

712
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,817
AUDIENCE: Can't be dynamically affected.

713
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,650
COLTON OGDEN: Can't be
dynamically affected.

714
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,190
So if you're walking through
a baked lighting scene

715
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,340
and you're expecting to cast a
shadow on something, or for something

716
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,860
to cast a shadow onto you,
it's not going to happen.

717
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,720
Because the environment's already been--

718
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,880
the lighting for that
scene has been pre-baked.

719
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,510
It's almost as if we've just
recolored the world in a specific way,

720
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,970
but we're not actually doing
any lighting calculations.

721
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,270
But this is how lighting
worked in, like, the N64 era.

722
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,850
And it's how it still works
now for certain situations.

723
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,790
If you know nothing is going
to cast a shadow on something,

724
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,270
you can make really nice
looking lighting for a scene

725
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,110
without needing to do it in real time.

726
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,250
You can just bake it, right?

727
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,290
So those are the
different types of lights.

728
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,480
So we can see that, in Unity--

729
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,940
so if we go here.

730
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,270
I'm going to-- so right now
we have a directional light.

731
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,700
So this directional light
is this object here.

732
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,640
By default, all-- and you can
zoom in as much as you want,

733
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,290
but it's sort of like--

734
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,140
oh, there we go.

735
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,270
This directional light is
only shining in one direction.

736
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,220
So I can move it here.

737
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,905
So currently I'm in--

738
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:27,470
it's a little bit
weird to navigate, just

739
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,490
because it's been rotated a little bit.

740
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,790
Given that it's a directional
light, its rotation--

741
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,210
So notice how it changes.

742
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,014
So if I shine it upwards, notice
that everything becomes black

743
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,180
because the lighting is
just shining upwards, right?

744
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,710
So as if it's coming from below.

745
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,700
And if I shine it towards
there, notice that the lighting

746
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,680
on the sphere and the little cube
there sort of change a bit, right?

747
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,190
Because they're getting affected by the
direction of the light a little bit.

748
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,230
But they both get
affected the exact same,

749
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,155
because the directional
light is omnipresent.

750
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:00,530
It's throughout the entire scene.

751
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,330
It's a global object.

752
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,250
Now if I delete the directional light--

753
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,380
Notice have no light
now, so these things just

754
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,160
look kind of, like, statically shaded.

755
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,290
You can add a new light through--

756
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,759
if you right click in your sort of game
object view, and then you go over here,

757
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:18,300
you can see we have all the
different lights we talked about.

758
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,910
There's also things called reflection
probes and light probe groups.

759
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,743
And those are a little
bit more complicated.

760
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:26,750
But those allow you to effectively
get pseudo-real-time lighting

761
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,185
and reflection with baked
lighting and reflection.

762
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:32,060
We won't talk about
those in today's lecture.

763
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,900
But here's a point light, for example.

764
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
So, let's see, where is it?

765
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,820
It's right over here.

766
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,820
So I'm going to move it over here.

767
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:46,002
So you can see it's not global like
the directional light was, right?

768
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:49,210
It's just affecting this very limited--
and I'm going to zoom in a little bit

769
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,668
so you can see a little bit better.

770
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:53,564
But it's affecting just
sort of these two objects

771
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:54,980
relative to where its position is.

772
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,455
And so this works perfectly for
things like lamps in your scene.

773
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:03,080
If you want to have a street
light, or whether you want to have

774
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,270
maybe like a fire going on in a house.

775
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,760
Or if you want the
power up that we had--

776
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,840
or the pickup that we had
in the Unity scene, right?

777
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,750
We have just the--

778
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:21,210
it's just emitting a purple light
that is within a very small radius.

779
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,250
Notice here we can change
the color of the light.

780
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,810
So if I make it like that--

781
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:37,010
there we go-- so I'll do that.

782
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,470
So notice now it's
emitting a purple light.

783
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,379
So you can color a
light however you want

784
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:42,920
to produce whatever effects you want.

785
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,100
So fire is not going
to emit white light.

786
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,740
It's probably going to emit
like an orange red light.

787
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,352
Street lights are probably going to emit
kind of like a yellow orangey light.

788
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:54,560
So depending on what your scene looks
like and what you're trying to emulate,

789
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,405
you can accomplish pretty much anything
with just these very simple objects.

790
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:02,180
So I'm going to get
rid of the point light.

791
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,390
And then I'm going to
create a spotlight.

792
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,630
I'm not going to create an area light
just because I need to actually bake

793
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,010
the lighting into the scene.

794
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,843
But I will create a spotlight just
so we can see what it looks like.

795
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:16,490
Get it in the right position.

796
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Sometimes it can be a little tough
to figure exactly where you are.

797
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,685
OK, getting close.

798
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:31,950
There we go.

799
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,540
Perfect.

800
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,229
So this little spotlight right here
is being produced by our object.

801
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:38,770
So you can see we can move it around.

802
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,430
And then we can apply a cookie
to it if we want to, as well.

803
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,190
It's right here.

804
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:46,080
So in your-- if you're in a spotlight
and you want to apply a texture to it,

805
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,980
just this little cookie--

806
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,230
and it just expects a texture.

807
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,630
So whatever image you want.

808
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,220
And if you're creating a cookie texture,
white means full light and black

809
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,112
means full shadow.

810
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,820
And so you can make
it a grayscale image.

811
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,680
You can make it anywhere
in between white and black,

812
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,520
which will allow you to produce
some interesting effects.

813
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,530
For example, the manual in--

814
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,370
It's not here.

815
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,470
I didn't include the
picture here, but the manual

816
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,340
shows there are some kind of like
the lights that you put on a stand.

817
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,590
And they have a bunch of LEDs, right?

818
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,470
And they're sort of in a grid,
and they shoot out a spotlight.

819
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,800
You can create a cookie that's kind of
a grayscale with those gridded lines,

820
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,020
and it'll shoot light onto
the scene as if it's being

821
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,910
broadcast from a sort of grid of LEDs.

822
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,240
So there's a lot you can do with
just some very simple ideas.

823
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,610
Those are the kinds of
lighting that we can use.

824
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,790
And in today's lecture, we only
really used the point light.

825
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,900
And in the last lecture we
used the directional light.

826
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,330
And spotlights you could,
for example, programmatically

827
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,190
change, for example, the
rotation of a spotlight,

828
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,960
if you want to have like a swinging
spotlight in your scene to illuminate

829
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,490
some wall or some surface.

830
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,900
There's a lot of cool
things you can do with it.

831
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,750
So those are the core
types of lights in Unity.

832
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,846
Does anybody have any questions as
to how they're used or how they were.

833
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:10,988
AUDIENCE: For directional
light, does it matter

834
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,660
where it's placed or only
the direction it's facing?

835
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,430
COLTON OGDEN: It does not matter--
so for the directional light,

836
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,660
it does not matter where it's placed.

837
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,451
You could place it
anywhere in your scene--

838
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:19,540
00 or some far distance away--

839
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,100
it'll have the exact same
effect on the entire scene.

840
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,850
Any more questions?

841
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,030
OK.

842
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,630
Cool, cool.

843
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,180
So those are lights.

844
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,050
Bump mapping, we'll
talk about very briefly.

845
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,580
So bump mapping is--

846
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,000
we actually do use this in the game.

847
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,750
A bump map effectively is-- so
what you see here on the left

848
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,820
is an actual 3D scene.

849
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,810
These are actual models
being shaded in real time.

850
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,690
Or, not in real time, but they're
actually real models being illuminated.

851
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,510
In the middle, we can see what's
called a bump map, and on the right,

852
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,240
we can see a-- that's just a flat--

853
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,020
like a flat plane.

854
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,090
With a bump map-- with that
same bump map-- applied to it,

855
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,590
and then illuminated.

856
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,970
So what a bump map allows us to do is
to take a flat wall or flat surface

857
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:14,820
or whatever you want, and then simulate
an actual three-dimensional contour,

858
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,540
three-dimensional bumps, or
whatever you want on that surface

859
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,740
without needing to create the
actual geometry to make it possible.

860
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,240
And so there are different
tools that will allow

861
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,050
you to create bump mapping objects--

862
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,220
or bump mapping textures.

863
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,060
Often 3D packages will have
these, so you can create them.

864
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,930
Or other software.

865
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,580
But they are effectively
just the encoding

866
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,130
of what are called surface normals.

867
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:50,130
So just a vector going from outside
of the polygon at that given point.

868
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,130
And they tell the
lighting system in Unity,

869
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:59,640
pretend as if there's actually
geometry pointed in that direction

870
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,990
when you calculate it.

871
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,310
And so, even though it doesn't
distort the geometry in a way that's--

872
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,150
like, this is still completely flat.

873
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:12,730
The lighting thinks that the geometry
is kind of, you know, contoured.

874
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,360
And so it allows us to create--

875
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,730
this is kind of a toy
example, but it's actually

876
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,900
relevant in the case
of walls that have--

877
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,760
and we covered this last week,
just not in as much detail.

878
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,860
But walls that you
want to be flat and you

879
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,485
don't want to have a lot of
polygons for, you can create a bump

880
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:30,369
map for and apply that bump map.

881
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,910
And then when you're rendering
it, when you walk past a wall,

882
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,600
it's going to look as if the wall
actually has cracks and bumps in it,

883
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,890
for a realistic effect.

884
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,140
And this is used in the
game to a slight degree.

885
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,820
And you can crank it up if you want to.

886
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,300
I didn't on my computer because
my specs aren't sufficient.

887
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,990
But every texture in today's example
has a bump map associated with it.

888
00:45:49,990 --> 00:46:01,920
So you can actually see the effect of
bump mapping at various degrees of use.

889
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,770
The materials here-- I'm going to go--

890
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:09,850
I'm going to load up the scene
that has the actual stuff.

891
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,340
I'm going to-- actually, I
don't need to load up the scene.

892
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,350
All I need to do is go to the materials.

893
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,630
And the floor, for example.

894
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,830
Where is the floor?

895
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,520
Right here.

896
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,000
So notice that before,
we talked about albedo,

897
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,740
and then I also mentioned normal map.

898
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,020
So right here, all you
really need to do in order

899
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,660
to get Unity to detect normal
maps-- and this is just

900
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,160
part of the standard shader.

901
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,480
Normal maps and bump maps, by the
way, are effectively synonymous.

902
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,740
You can just drag your
normal map texture

903
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,020
into this field here,
this little square,

904
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,600
and then give it a degree at
which to apply that normal map.

905
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,260
And so if you look at this
here, you might be able to see--

906
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,270
I don't recall.

907
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:56,090
Yeah, we can sort of see how
it changes the texture, right?

908
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:02,000
So at zero, there's no normal
mapping taking place at all.

909
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,190
That texture is just
completely flat, as if we

910
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,850
had done just the regular
apply texture to a sphere.

911
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,980
But the degree at which we apply normal
mapping-- so notice that at degree one,

912
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,830
it kind of looks pretty realistic, as
if we've got kind of a stony texture.

913
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,860
And the more we go, the more
exaggerated it starts to look, right?

914
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,400
And you can just keep doing
that, and it'll eventually just

915
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,660
look really distorted.

916
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,535
But that allows you--

917
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,410
and depending on how
strong your computer is,

918
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,750
you can go higher or lower--

919
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,380
to affect just how bumpy--

920
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,610
just how strong the bump map, the normal
map, affects the lighting rendering.

921
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,410
So it's that easy to get
just a fairly, sort of,

922
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,360
extra sense of realism in your scene.

923
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,610
So you'll notice, if you're
walking through the scene,

924
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,710
if you turn off lighting
it's even easier to see

925
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,220
all of the surfaces, the floors,
the ceilings, and the walls

926
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,820
have a bump map as
well as a texture map.

927
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,190
So that's-- in case you're wondering
what these weird colored textures are,

928
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:10,520
RGB or XYZ for the surface normals
and their permutations thereof.

929
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,410
And that's how it gets
encoded into this.

930
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,910
And so often you can see--

931
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,850
if you're looking at a bump
map and a texture map--

932
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,789
you can kind of see together,
like, oh, OK this makes sense.

933
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:21,830
The parts that I would
expect to be bumpier or do

934
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:26,810
have a correlation to how they look
on the actual bump map texture.

935
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,910
You can see it here.

936
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,790
Everything that is bumpy or contoured
is very visible in the bump map.

937
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,210
And that's just by nature of
the way the data is encoded.

938
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,424
So any questions as to how
bump maps work or what they are

939
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:39,590
or how to use them in Unity?

940
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,640
All right.

941
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,360
Cool.

942
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,568
So now we're going to start
getting a little bit more

943
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:50,600
into how this all comes together
in our maze on our game,

944
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,150
and we'll talk about maze generation.

945
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:58,910
So I'm going to just
start up the scene here.

946
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:02,330
So I'm in the actual play scene.

947
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,850
So in scenes, I loaded
up play as before.

948
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,366
I'm going to hit Play.

949
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,907
I'm going to turn off my sound,
just because the creepy sound

950
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:12,712
is a little disorienting after a while.

951
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:13,670
And then I'm going to--

952
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,930
actually, I'm going to
go to a 2 by 3 view.

953
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,620
And then hit Play.

954
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,670
So we have the regular
game view down here below.

955
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:34,800
And then also, if I zoom out, you can
see that our scene was empty before,

956
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,050
but now we've got a maze.

957
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:40,770
And currently it's not very
visible at all because one,

958
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,890
we're applying fog, right?

959
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,860
And recall fog allows us
to effectively add color

960
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,790
to objects that are
farther away from us.

961
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,850
And two, there's a
ceiling on top of our--

962
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,580
a roof on top of our maze.

963
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,530
So it's actually blocking
out what the maze looks like.

964
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,380
So we can fairly easily
make a couple of changes

965
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,660
here in order to see our
maze a little bit better.

966
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,520
So I'm going to go to Window, I'm
going to go to Lighting, Settings.

967
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,930
And so if you go to
Window, Lighting, Settings,

968
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,750
those are your sort of global
Unity lighting settings.

969
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,650
You can set your skybox, you
can set environment lighting,

970
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,130
you can set things like fog, you
can choose how things are baked.

971
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,300
There's a lot of things here.

972
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,850
We won't cover nearly all of them.

973
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,070
We will cover a few of them.

974
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,884
Environment lighting is a big one.

975
00:50:26,884 --> 00:50:29,300
That's actually how we're
lighting the scene in this game.

976
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,140
So all of the lighting that's not--

977
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,077
well, all of the lighting
is environment lighting.

978
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,160
That's how we're doing it.

979
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,380
We're doing it with color.

980
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,640
So notice that you can choose
Skybox, Gradient, and Color.

981
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,650
So if you choose skybox Environment.
lighting, it's going to have sort of--

982
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,440
it's going to look kind of like
this skybox that we have here.

983
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,980
This sort of in the far
distance, looks blue.

984
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,470
Kind of a little bit more natural.

985
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,860
But I didn't-- but when
it's applied to our scene,

986
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,590
it doesn't look quite the
way we want it to look.

987
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,860
So what we went with
instead was just color.

988
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,190
And I chose this sort of
murky greenish brownish color.

989
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,620
And that gave the result
that I was looking for.

990
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,630
But you can make this
any color you want to.

991
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,000
We can make this some sort
of bright yellow color.

992
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,958
I have no idea what this
is going to look like.

993
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:15,460
This is probably going
to look horrible, but--

994
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,340
Yep.

995
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,990
I mean, actually, this--

996
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,030
is in a weird way this
kind of looks interesting.

997
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:25,160
It actually looks closer to the original
Dreadhalls game than what I did.

998
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,427
But it's not very scary.

999
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:28,010
Kind of looks like we're in a pyramid.

1000
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,290
That is-- am I able to go back?

1001
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:33,910
No.

1002
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:34,410
OK.

1003
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,960
Well, I screwed up the color.

1004
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,100
Now I'm trying to find kind
of what color I had before.

1005
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,110
It's kind of like a nasty green.

1006
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,950
Kind of like that.

1007
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,360
That's probably good enough.

1008
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,900
OK.

1009
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,930
Something like that.

1010
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:54,147
And so we play it again, we can see
we're back to the nasty dark color.

1011
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,480
But that's environment lighting.

1012
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,101
So it applies a lighting,
uniform, just ambience.

1013
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:01,850
Kind of like a directional light,
but it doesn't have a direction.

1014
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:08,990
It just applies to everything in
your scene at a given intensity.

1015
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,320
And that is how we are
lighting our scene.

1016
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,220
It's that easy.

1017
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,640
Just environment lighting in our
scene and our lighting scene window.

1018
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,300
Now, the other important
thing here is the fog.

1019
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,370
So fog is as easy--

1020
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,610
almost as easy as just clicking
this button here that says fog,

1021
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,770
and then choosing a
color for it, probably.

1022
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,010
You can choose the density, so
obviously if it's a higher density fog

1023
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,320
it's going to look as if
you're in a foggier place.

1024
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,040
It's going to sum the color to
things that are closer to you

1025
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,460
faster than it would if you
had a lower density fog.

1026
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,949
And there are some other
features here, some of which

1027
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:45,240
I'm not terribly familiar with.

1028
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,320
But for the sake of today's
example, just the click--

1029
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,880
make sure fog is selected.

1030
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,620
And then click, make sure you
have the right color for your fog.

1031
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,700
So if you have like a ridiculous
red color for your fog,

1032
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,030
it's probably going to look weird.

1033
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,406
Yep.

1034
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:02,780
But you can see how you can
do all kinds of weird effects

1035
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,335
just by adding these things together.

1036
00:53:04,335 --> 00:53:07,210
Like, if you want to have the effect
of being in some sort of, like--

1037
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,790
I don't know, noxious foreign world,
maybe you want like a purple fog

1038
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,780
instead of like a dark
green fog or whatever.

1039
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,400
That's super easy.

1040
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,290
You produce a lot of very basic
but effective effects that way.

1041
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,926
Let me find-- I think it was just that
kind of the same nasty green color.

1042
00:53:22,926 --> 00:53:24,800
AUDIENCE: How you bring
this screen up again?

1043
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,066
The one that says lighting?

1044
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,940
COLTON OGDEN: So to bring up this
lighting screen, all you need to do

1045
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,920
is, if you're on a Mac--

1046
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,190
I think in Windows it's
the same thing-- there's

1047
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,230
a Window option in the top menu.

1048
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,730
Window, and then Lighting
here, and then Settings.

1049
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,100
And so this will bring you to all of the
settings that are pertinent to at least

1050
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,766
today's example.

1051
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,020
And so we're not using
any lights in our scene

1052
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:50,490
that we talked about before, at least
for the lighting of the scene itself.

1053
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,020
Now, there are point lights
being used for the pickups,

1054
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,430
and I'll show you that in a second.

1055
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:02,460
But what I wanted to illustrate
was how we can look at our maze

1056
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,880
after it's been generated.

1057
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,700
And so what we need to do first--

1058
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,490
notice that before we couldn't
really see our maze at a distance

1059
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,990
because it was just purely
dark green because of the fog.

1060
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:18,870
It was adding green to that
geometry because it was so far away.

1061
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,645
So I'm going to disable fog for now.

1062
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:23,186
It'll actually remember your
settings, which is kind of nice.

1063
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:25,950
So just going to disable fog.

1064
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,600
And I'm going to actually add a
directional light to the scene.

1065
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,619
So I'm going to go here,
add a directional light.

1066
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,160
And then I'm going to hit Play again.

1067
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:42,165
So now, our scene is lit.

1068
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:49,960
And, you know, it looks a lot
different, a lot less scary.

1069
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,040
And we can see our maze lot better.

1070
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,930
We can actually see that it
is a collection of blocks.

1071
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,160
It's tiled blocks.

1072
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,880
Now, we can't see into the maze
because the maze has a roof.

1073
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,980
So what I did was I just
made a generated roof,

1074
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,170
an option in the script, and so if you
unselect that and then we try again,

1075
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,830
now we can see our maze.

1076
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,029
So this is what our mazes look like.

1077
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:16,320
And so the cool thing about
Unity, which I really love,

1078
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,540
is just this ability to look
through your scene independent

1079
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,500
of the actual game, just to help debug.

1080
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,550
It's hard to know if you're
generating your maze correctly

1081
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,800
when you're creating it in 3D.

1082
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,940
You know, in 2D you can
easily just look at it.

1083
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,910
But in 3D, especially in a first-person
game, you can't really see it.

1084
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,110
So being able to split your view
like this-- the scene and the game--

1085
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,400
and actually see, oh, my algorithm's
working, or it's not working.

1086
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,120
Super helpful.

1087
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,240
So we can see that it is
carving a maze for us.

1088
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,450
It looks a little bit weird.

1089
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:53,730
It's not a traditional maze in the
sense that it has the classic maze

1090
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:54,870
shape to it.

1091
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,830
But it effectively functions as
a maze, and it works very well

1092
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,530
for its intended purpose.

1093
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,680
And the algorithm is incredibly
simple, and we'll talk about that.

1094
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,440
So that's our maze.

1095
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,320
I'm going to go ahead
and revert all of the--

1096
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,610
I think if I just reload the
scene it should just revert it.

1097
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,110
Don't save.

1098
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,730
Yep.

1099
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,521
OK, so everything's been reverted,
all the lighting and everything.

1100
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:19,770
Just going to do a sanity
check and make sure.

1101
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:20,610
Yep.

1102
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,250
Everything works perfectly well.

1103
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,960
So anybody have any
ideas as to where to get

1104
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,500
started if we were to
implement a 3D maze?

1105
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,490
AUDIENCE: The way I
did it once before is

1106
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:40,760
you put a bunch of x's where you want
something to be drawn in an array.

1107
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:47,270
And then you loop through the array
and draw, instantiate the walls.

1108
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,020
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1109
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,190
So create an array.

1110
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,870
Populate it with x's where you want--

1111
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,081
data wherever you want
something to be instantiated,

1112
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:57,830
then loop over and
instantiate everything.

1113
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,830
That's exactly how it works.

1114
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:04,250
Now, in terms of actually
creating the maze,

1115
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,110
do you have any ideas as to what--

1116
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:09,940
how would you go about implementing
a simple maze generator?

1117
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,415
And there are, obviously, very
complicated maze generation algorithms,

1118
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:17,747
so nothing terribly
fancy, but just a simple--

1119
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:18,830
how would you make a maze?

1120
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,891
AUDIENCE: So it's random?

1121
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:20,390
Or--

1122
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,473
COLTON OGDEN: It's random.

1123
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,490
So starting with the idea
that we have an array, right?

1124
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,670
It's got to be a 2D array because
we have two axes upon which

1125
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,420
we're generating things here.

1126
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,670
Even though we're in a 3D
environment, we don't need a 3D array.

1127
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,290
We just need a 2D array.

1128
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,080
Because if there is a
positive value for wherever

1129
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,830
we want to generate a
block in our 3D maze,

1130
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,850
we just generate a column of blocks.

1131
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,840
We don't need to worry about
a third dimension, right?

1132
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,890
Our maze isn't taking into consideration
multiple levels, at which point

1133
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,590
we would need to maybe
consider three dimensions.

1134
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:14,460
And even still, you can still divide
those into separate 2D arrays of mazes.

1135
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,580
We just have an x and a y.

1136
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,456
So how would we get started--

1137
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:22,330
what would we start populating the
arra-- let's say we have an array,

1138
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:24,320
it's just a bunch of zeros, right?

1139
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,530
What are we populating with the
array after we have initialized it?

1140
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,618
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
maybe you would kind of start

1141
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:44,830
off with just four walls
add corridors, maybe?

1142
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,870
COLTON OGDEN: So start with a bunch
of walls and then add corridors.

1143
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,990
That's exactly what we do.

1144
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,220
The algorithm is actually pretty simple.

1145
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,790
So I'll try and maybe draw
a little bit, just to see

1146
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,530
if I can illustrate how this works.

1147
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,613
AUDIENCE: How do you make sure that
you can get from one side to the other

1148
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:04,500
and there's no wall in between?

1149
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,530
COLTON OGDEN: By making sure that every
thing that you change is orthogonal.

1150
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,540
Every block-- every step
that you move is orthogonal.

1151
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,820
That will ensure that you start at
one point, end at another point,

1152
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,940
and those points will always
be accessible to one another,

1153
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,250
just by virtue of how
simple the algorithm is

1154
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,910
and the orthogonality of it.

1155
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,980
So if we start with walls--

1156
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:35,250
so 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

1157
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:39,142
These are all-- in the
distro, these are all Booleans

1158
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,850
because we don't need-- we only
need zeros and ones so we're just

1159
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,150
going to use true and false.

1160
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,600
We don't need to use integers for that.

1161
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,900
So this is our starting maze here.

1162
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:53,160
And actually I'm going to add
another dimension because--

1163
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,700
or not another dimension,
but another size,

1164
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,260
just because the walls always
need to stay-- to be there.

1165
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,540
These are basically untouchable.

1166
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,760
I'm going to try and
draw that as best I can.

1167
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,950
Right.

1168
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,850
So we effectively have this as our
working area for creating a maze.

1169
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,066
Because we want this to be--

1170
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:17,940
we want walls no matter
what because we don't

1171
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,065
want our person to be able
to walk outside the maze

1172
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:21,600
or see the outside world, ever.

1173
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,130
We want them to be locked in.

1174
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:29,470
So we have all of these ones
here, these trues, effectively.

1175
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:33,690
And so all we need to do is
start at some random position,

1176
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,980
let's say this value.

1177
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,140
At 3, 2-- or, well, it's
actually, technically

1178
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,820
it's 2, 3 because we index at
y and then x in a 2D array.

1179
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,782
So we go 2, 3.

1180
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:48,720
We go here.

1181
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,700
And then we basically
can move either left--

1182
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,314
or we can move either left
or right or up or down.

1183
01:00:57,314 --> 01:00:58,980
But we can't move both at the same time.

1184
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,822
And why can't we move
both at the same time?

1185
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:04,780
Let's say that we're-- let's say,
first of all, let me say that we're--

1186
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,880
let's say we're going to carve
our way through the maze.

1187
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:16,050
So we're going to turn these ones into
zeros, but we can only move either--

1188
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:19,530
we can only move orthogonally,
meaning left or right up or down.

1189
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:20,970
We can't move diagonally.

1190
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,770
So we can only--

1191
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:28,530
let's say we have an x move, right?

1192
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,479
And a y move.

1193
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,070
And those can be set to--

1194
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,420
by default they're 0, so
we're basically saying,

1195
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,594
where on this step of the
generation are we going to move?

1196
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:43,510
And actually, technically, it's
direction because we're-- the way that

1197
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,585
we do it is via directions.

1198
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:48,403
AUDIENCE: So if you're moving
down, then what's in front of you

1199
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:50,135
will have no wall.

1200
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:53,685
And there'll be walls on either side
of you except for where you came from.

1201
01:01:54,185 --> 01:01:54,976
COLTON OGDEN: Yeah.

1202
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:58,120
So if you're here and they move
down, this is going to be 0,

1203
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,940
this is going to be 0, and
so those points are linked.

1204
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:05,260
And then from there we're going
to move in a given direction.

1205
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,810
And so all of tho--
let's say they move here.

1206
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,330
All of those are going to be linked.

1207
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:14,350
And so if we move here, all of
those are going to be linked.

1208
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:17,350
Just by virtue of the fact
that we're moving orthogonally,

1209
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,590
we can't create a maze
that's unreachable.

1210
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,879
Because the way that--

1211
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:25,170
just by virtue of the fact
they're moving orthogonally.

1212
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:29,370
Now if we move diagonally, if
I were to move here, right?

1213
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,960
There's walls right here
and then two spaces there.

1214
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,840
That's not going to work
because we can't access that.

1215
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,400
We see a-- we're going to see
a cube here and a cube here.

1216
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,257
And we're going to see-- we won't be
able to move diagonally through walls.

1217
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,090
So that's why we need
to ensure that we only

1218
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:48,350
move either in the x or y
direction, not both at once.

1219
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:52,450
And so what the algorithm does is
it randomly chooses should I move x

1220
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,980
or should I move y.

1221
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,120
And should I move positive or negative.

1222
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,780
So it'll do-- math dot random, equal--

1223
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,970
you know, two equals 1.

1224
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,380
Effectively in the code it's
random dot value, less than 0.5,

1225
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:10,150
because random dot value in Unity
gives you 0 to 1 as a float.

1226
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:15,310
So you say if random
dot value less than 0.5,

1227
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:20,650
which is a random chance between
true and false, effectively 50%--

1228
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,790
move in x or move in y.

1229
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:27,850
And then same thing, but should I move
in the negative or positive direction?

1230
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:31,000
So if I'm here, I'm
thinking, OK, let's see.

1231
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,274
X move or y move?

1232
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:35,440
Again it's going to be an x move, so
I'm going to move either left or right.

1233
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,380
OK, so am I going to move
either negative one or one

1234
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,410
step, one to the right or to the left?

1235
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:45,570
So if it's negative 1 and that is
going to move to the left, right?

1236
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,870
And if it's positive 1 it's
going to move to the right.

1237
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,350
So that's the essence of the algorithm,
just looped over a bunch of times.

1238
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:58,420
Whenever I move to another
tile, turn that into a zero.

1239
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,720
So actually, this becomes a zero.

1240
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,580
Change the color.

1241
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,580
So this will become a zero.

1242
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:10,210
So that's now an empty space.

1243
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:13,900
And in the code, that instantly
teleports the character to that space,

1244
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,680
too.

1245
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,100
So we know that our character is
always going to be in an empty space,

1246
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:22,690
because he gets placed in the first open
space that gets generated in the maze.

1247
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:27,940
And so let's say x move is equal
to negative 1 on this iteration.

1248
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:31,540
So let's say we're looping
until we've cleared x blocks.

1249
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,060
So I want to clear-- let's say
I want to clear five blocks.

1250
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:39,190
So to clear equals 5.

1251
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,190
That's how many blocks--

1252
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,940
when we've cleared that many blocks,
we're done with the maze generator.

1253
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,880
So cleared one, so our
current counter is one.

1254
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,100
So x, we get-- flip a coin.

1255
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,040
We're moving to the x
direction by negative 1.

1256
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:02,590
So we move to here, and then
we turn this into a zero.

1257
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:08,390
Now, this implementation of the
algorithm moves one step at a time.

1258
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,190
And so because of its randomness,
what this ends up doing is

1259
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:15,650
it produces very large
chunks of deformed space,

1260
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,520
just because the crawler is
just constantly moving around,

1261
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,170
kind of, like, haphazardly.

1262
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,840
So what's a refinement that
we can make to this algorithm

1263
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,018
to make it look a little bit more
like corridors or like hallways?

1264
01:05:27,018 --> 01:05:29,309
AUDIENCE: Just keep going
until you hit the other wall?

1265
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:30,770
In the same direction?

1266
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,561
COLTON OGDEN: You could
do that, yeah, keep

1267
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,640
going until you hit the other wall.

1268
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,270
The result of that--

1269
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,390
you mean to hit the side of the maze?

1270
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,150
Yeah, because it--
well, if you did that,

1271
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,390
it would effectively just be like--

1272
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,810
it would kind of be--

1273
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:50,150
it might work in some cases, but
it will be very long hallways

1274
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:53,130
and not a lot of turns
or anything like that.

1275
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:57,650
So the result, what we actually
want to do, is when we flip a coin

1276
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:03,920
and we say x move or y move, we
want to also say times to move.

1277
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,240
We want to create a new variable called
number of times to move, effectively.

1278
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:14,930
To move, and then we just set
that to a random number between 1,

1279
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:22,460
so we're going to move 1 tile,
or the size of the maze minus 2.

1280
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,950
Taking in consideration
both walls, right?

1281
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:28,130
So let's say we get the--

1282
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:32,920
let's say we-- let's say
we did x move minus 1,

1283
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,836
and we only got to
move equal to 1, right?

1284
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:36,710
So we only move here.

1285
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:40,040
We move once in this direction,
so we've got two spaces.

1286
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,270
And then let's say we flip a coin
again and then we got y move--

1287
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,310
positive 1.

1288
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:50,120
And then two move, we got two.

1289
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:54,620
So we're going to move two
directions in the y-axis by one.

1290
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:59,030
So this is a result of us going
down here, so we go 0 and then 0.

1291
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,970
And so the effect of
this is that we move--

1292
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:11,240
we can move in more than
just one block at a time

1293
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:17,540
and avoid the sort of random, like,
haphazard, weird, organic, large room

1294
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,780
aesthetic that we want.

1295
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:26,110
If we want like a hallway, grid-like,
dungeon looking room generator, right?

1296
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:32,480
Now there's a caveat to this, and
that is if we start here, for example,

1297
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,400
and then we want to--

1298
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,660
let's say we flip a coin.

1299
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,470
It's x move, but it's positive four.

1300
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:43,600
We can't obviously move four
tiles to the right because one,

1301
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,770
it will go into our walls
on the outside, and two,

1302
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,480
it's actually beyond
the bounds of our array.

1303
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,440
So we need to clamp that value down.

1304
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,200
When we add 1 to our
value, to wherever our x--

1305
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,700
we have to basically keep pointers.

1306
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,030
We keep pointer to whichever
tile we're currently at.

1307
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,920
We need to keep--

1308
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,580
when we actually go to
the next tile in our step,

1309
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,300
we need to clamp that value
within the range of our walls.

1310
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,890
So we need to clamp between one--

1311
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,439
so because we don't want to be at zero--

1312
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:24,649
we want to clamp it between one
and main size minus two, actually.

1313
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:28,310
Because we want to make sure that we
don't go any farther than this one

1314
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,600
here.

1315
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,740
Does that make sense?

1316
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,490
This is how-- that is effectively
how our generator works.

1317
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,250
It's a step beyond just the
move one block at a time,

1318
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,840
just because the mazes look
away too empty and weird.

1319
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,819
With this approach where
you're moving in a direction,

1320
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:47,720
and for a random number of tiles
as opposed to just one at a time,

1321
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,350
you actually get pretty
nice looking, simple mazes.

1322
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:56,068
This isn't how actual maze generation
works, for mazes that you would see

1323
01:08:56,068 --> 01:08:59,359
and an actual maze that you do in, like,
a crossword puzzle book or a maze book

1324
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,080
or something.

1325
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,840
Those are more complicated.

1326
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,630
But this solution works well.

1327
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:10,500
It's very fast and very cheap, and
actually pretty simple to understand.

1328
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,910
So any questions as to how the maze
generator-- the algorithm, at least

1329
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,590
as applied to our 2D, array works?

1330
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,301
All right.

1331
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:19,800
Cool.

1332
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,844
That's the-- that's
basically the gist of it.

1333
01:09:22,844 --> 01:09:26,010
So we're going to take a break here for
about five minutes, and then as soon

1334
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,140
as we get back we'll
dive a little bit more

1335
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:32,840
into sort of how the character
controller works, and the pickup,

1336
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,700
and a few other aspects of the game.

1337
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,649
All right, welcome back to Lecture 9.

1338
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:40,350
So before the break we
were talking about the way

1339
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,810
that we implemented
procedural maze generation.

1340
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:47,520
So a fairly simple algorithm
that creates this sort of hallway

1341
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,439
look where we can easily get lost.

1342
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,319
But they aren't technically
mazes in the traditional sense

1343
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:57,390
like you might have seen growing
up in puzzle books and such.

1344
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,990
Another pitch for Catlike Coding,
because his articles are amazing.

1345
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:05,530
He has another one on how
he did a maze generator.

1346
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:08,230
And in this one, beyond
just regular blocks--

1347
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,060
oh, I'm sorry.

1348
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,080
I didn't have the slide
there on that thing.

1349
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,570
So this is a screenshot
of another article

1350
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:20,229
from Catlike Coding where he talks about
how to make his own maze generator.

1351
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,020
And the cool thing
about his is that he has

1352
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,186
a bunch of different geometry
involved in the scene.

1353
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,320
It's not just blocks.

1354
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,900
He has doors and windows
and other things.

1355
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,270
And his algorithm is a little
bit different than mine

1356
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,550
and produces some pretty
interesting looking things.

1357
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,050
And you can see here, also,
it has a view of the scene

1358
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:40,260
sort of superimposed on
the actual scene, which

1359
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,460
he does with a trick using two cameras.

1360
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,010
So here's another maze slash
dungeon generator article

1361
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:52,822
that I really like where he
creates sort of like Dungeons

1362
01:10:52,822 --> 01:10:54,030
and Dragons-style generators.

1363
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:56,550
And this is sort of pertinent
to my interests as a developer

1364
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:00,450
because I really love roguelikes
and dungeon generators and RPGs,

1365
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:03,180
but he goes into extensive
detail on how to make

1366
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,980
a really nice and
efficient 2D maze slash

1367
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:10,460
dungeon generator that produces
really nice looking dungeons.

1368
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,680
As you can see here, it's got a very
variable layout, lots of corridors

1369
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,039
and rooms and stuff like that.

1370
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,580
So implementing some like this
in Unity would be really cool,

1371
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,700
and there's a plethora
of generators and assets

1372
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,182
like this that will do the
same kind of thing in Unity

1373
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:24,390
available in the asset store.

1374
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,960
So you don't have to make this
yourself most of the time.

1375
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,340
You can create-- you can just go
find either free or paid assets that

1376
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,600
will do all this for you and save
you a tremendous amount of time.

1377
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,270
And how much of them are
also very customizable, too,

1378
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:40,290
so that you can tailor the generator
to fit the demand of your game.

1379
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:43,290
So we saw how the lighting
works in our game.

1380
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:48,460
We've seen the maze, sort of how,
it's generated, what it looks like.

1381
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,380
We have not taken a look yet
at the character controller.

1382
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,130
So we'll briefly just
take a look at that.

1383
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,650
It's actually incredibly
easy to do in Unity, at least

1384
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,950
to get something fairly
basic up and running.

1385
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:04,110
The way that we get a FPS controller
in the case of our game is Unity has,

1386
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:09,390
which I alluded to before, a
set of built-in standard asset

1387
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,710
packs that allow people getting
used to the game engine,

1388
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:15,000
or just trying to
bootstrap their game, up

1389
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,860
and running with some
very basic components.

1390
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:22,050
Very basic things that are super
helpful for getting your game running.

1391
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,890
So actually we used the prototyping
standard assets pack for our pickup.

1392
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:32,280
We use the characters one for
the character controller, the FPS

1393
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,270
controller.

1394
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,640
So if you're in a fresh project
and you just go to Import Package

1395
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,140
and you import this character thing
here, it'll import into your game.

1396
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:44,700
So that you can immediately use the
prefabs that it gives you to create

1397
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,370
a character object.

1398
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:49,980
So it will, by default, just
put it in your assets folder.

1399
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,440
Underneath Standard Assets,
and then Characters,

1400
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,171
and then there's a first-person folder.

1401
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:55,920
And within the
first-person folder there's

1402
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,790
a prefabs folder which has the
FPS controller game object.

1403
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,430
And so all you need to do is
just drag it into the scene,

1404
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:05,490
and then that becomes
your default camera.

1405
01:13:08,196 --> 01:13:09,899
AUDIENCE: That comes with Unity?

1406
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,690
COLTON OGDEN: It comes
with Unity, correct.

1407
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:12,898
That's just a standard asset.

1408
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:15,000
AUDIENCE: And it's always
in the prefabs folder?

1409
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,360
COLTON OGDEN: It's always in the-- the
FPS controller will always be in the--

1410
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,710
so you have to import it first.

1411
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,950
You have to import the asset package.

1412
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:24,450
The characters package.

1413
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,030
Once you've imported
the characters package,

1414
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,520
you'll go into Standard
Assets in your assets folder.

1415
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,160
There'll be a new folder
called Standard Assets.

1416
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,500
Within Standard Assets you'll go to
Characters, then First Person, and then

1417
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,447
Prefabs, and then that's where
you'll find the FPS controller.

1418
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:41,280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1419
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,030
COLTON OGDEN: Yes.

1420
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,720
No problem.

1421
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,690
So the FPS controller,
if we take a look at it--

1422
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,550
we talked about it before, briefly.

1423
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:52,440
But effectively, it's
just a capsule collider,

1424
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,220
which is sort of defying
physics, because it's kinematic.

1425
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,980
Kinematic with gravity applied to it.

1426
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,280
And it has a camera sort
of towards the top of it

1427
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,680
where the head is to simulate
the perspective of somebody

1428
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,450
from first person view.

1429
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,340
And there's some
programming involved that

1430
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:11,010
allows you to control it
with the keys and the mouse,

1431
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:14,100
to control the camera's rotation
with the mouse and the position

1432
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:19,610
of the collider with the WASD keys.

1433
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,390
And if you want, you can dig into
the actual script for it, too.

1434
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:26,380
They're all included with
the standard assets pack.

1435
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,289
When you import that
into your project, it

1436
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:30,580
comes with all the scripts
that make all that possible.

1437
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:35,050
I haven't dug through all of them in too
much detail, but it's all there for you

1438
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,690
if curious as to how it works.

1439
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:42,810
And so if you want to get just a
simple FPS controller in your game,

1440
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:46,330
a character in your game, to walk
around and play a first person game,

1441
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:49,820
it takes about a minute
to get up and running.

1442
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:52,150
Now, there's a lot of
customization that you

1443
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,460
can apply to your character
controller to make it

1444
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:59,320
not just the standard, basic character.

1445
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,340
So you can set a walk speed,
you can set a run speed.

1446
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:09,240
You can set jump speed, you can set
the sensitivity of the mouse look

1447
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,970
on the game-- on the FPS controller.

1448
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:16,660
You can apply what's called FOV kick,
which means when you're sprinting--

1449
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,780
which it allows you to
sprint with pressing Shift,

1450
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,880
which multiplies your speed--

1451
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:27,640
it'll actually-- it'll expand your
depth of field a little bit to make it

1452
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,580
look as if you're kind
of claustrophobic.

1453
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:33,964
Things kind of go out, and
so it looks more narrow,

1454
01:15:33,964 --> 01:15:36,880
and it kind of gives you that look
as if you're sprinting down a path,

1455
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,130
and you can set just how
much it increases by.

1456
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,870
You can see the curve of
how that is applied here.

1457
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,620
So this is one of the components
that Unity allows you to do,

1458
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:48,460
is there's a curve object,
and you can use this curve

1459
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,750
to influence various
things in your game.

1460
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,660
I actually haven't used it much, myself.

1461
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:56,560
But if you're looking for
something to apply a curve to,

1462
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,510
Unity has an interface for making
that visible within your inspector.

1463
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,390
Head bob, which means when I
walk, should the camera kind of

1464
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,150
go up and down?

1465
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,500
When you do have a head bob,
what's the curve look like?

1466
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,737
So here's another curve.

1467
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:12,820
This is sort of what the
head bob looks like, kind

1468
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:17,710
of a sine wave but a
little bit distorted.

1469
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,590
And a few other things.

1470
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,029
So, for example, footstep sounds.

1471
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:24,070
Maybe you don't like the sounds that
come by default with the controller,

1472
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,912
so you give it your own footstep sounds.

1473
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:26,620
Super easy to do.

1474
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,080
Just drag new sounds here.

1475
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,640
Jump sound and a landing sound.

1476
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,920
Two more sounds that you can add to it.

1477
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,030
And that'll allow you to customize most
of the feel of how your character moves

1478
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,950
around in terms of just
a basic FPS controller.

1479
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:47,150
And so just by applying those very basic
things, customized them a little bit--

1480
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:49,240
we got lucky with this maze.

1481
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,940
And this means that the maze
went all the way around and then

1482
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,065
looped right back to where
we were and ended there.

1483
01:16:54,065 --> 01:16:58,180
So this is-- that's that maze, OK.

1484
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,040
I'm going to go ahead
and turn up the sound.

1485
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,090
You can hear the footsteps, right?

1486
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,710
Along with the creepy whispering.

1487
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:13,000
But the footsteps are just provided
to us by the FPS controller,

1488
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,040
and again, you can customize
those to be whatever you want.

1489
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
And so this gives you the
ability to walk around

1490
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,623
in your scene for a first person view.

1491
01:17:19,623 --> 01:17:22,090
It doesn't really give
you much more than that.

1492
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:26,260
In order to do an FPS where you have
maybe a gun or a weapon or something,

1493
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,140
you need to program some more things
and it's a lot more complicated.

1494
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:33,880
But for just basic navigation of a
3D scene, it's a great foundation,

1495
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,200
a great way to get started.

1496
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,780
So any question as to how
the FPS controller works?

1497
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,120
There are other controllers, too.

1498
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,110
There are third-person controllers.

1499
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,610
So if you want to use those.

1500
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:50,110
They don't come with a camera--
based on my experimentation,

1501
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,206
they don't actually come
with a camera by default.

1502
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:54,580
So I think you have to parent
a camera to them in the way

1503
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,900
that you want for your game.

1504
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,440
Like, for example, some games have the
camera super high above your character

1505
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,315
while you're walking
around, and some of them

1506
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:06,250
have a behind the shoulder look,
almost like Fortnite or Gears

1507
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,200
of War, really close to the character.

1508
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,530
And then some kind of have--
like in Banjo Kazooie,

1509
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,340
you could be walking up a
mountain and so the camera

1510
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:15,339
is kind of like perpendicular to where
you are, and sort of follows you.

1511
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:18,129
Around so camera programming
for 3D characters

1512
01:18:18,129 --> 01:18:20,920
is a little bit more complicated
than it is for first person games.

1513
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,110
And so that's why I mentioned it
doesn't come with a camera by default,

1514
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:26,179
so it can be a little
bit more complicated.

1515
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:28,720
But I do believe there are a
lot of assets on the asset store

1516
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:32,180
that can help bootstrap you if
you're getting a programmatic camera

1517
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:37,660
setup going for your character
in a third-person view.

1518
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,160
Yeah.

1519
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,660
AUDIENCE: I've noticed when
you're walking around your maze,

1520
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:45,329
occasionally you're clipping the wall
and kind of seeing what's behind it.

1521
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:46,120
COLTON OGDEN: Yeah.

1522
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,286
That-- I believe that's a result of the
collider being a little bit too big.

1523
01:18:49,286 --> 01:18:53,040
So what he said was that
walking through the maze,

1524
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,297
you can kind of clip through
the wall a little bit.

1525
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,130
Let's see if you can
actually experience it.

1526
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:59,680
Yeah, like right there.

1527
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,190
Yeah.

1528
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:04,690
And that's the-- I believe that's
just the camera or the collider

1529
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,610
being a little bit too large.

1530
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:09,100
And so we could probably get
rid of that altogether just

1531
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,450
by shrinking the collider a little bit.

1532
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,780
Just a detail that I didn't iron out.

1533
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:16,390
But you'll see that in a
lot of games, actually.

1534
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:20,530
A lot of games have clipping
that you can observe,

1535
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:22,180
depending on how they program the game.

1536
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,330
But, yeah.

1537
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:29,320
Any other questions as to how
character controllers work,

1538
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:34,510
and how the import process works,
and how to get it in your scene?

1539
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:35,730
OK.

1540
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,230
Cool.

1541
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,449
Yeah, it's super easy.

1542
01:19:37,449 --> 01:19:39,490
Again, here's what the
FPS controller looks like.

1543
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:41,939
Capsule collider with a camera.

1544
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:43,480
And then the third-person controller.

1545
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,354
By default they give you a pretty
nice looking model on the left side

1546
01:19:46,354 --> 01:19:48,349
there so that you can
experiment with it.

1547
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:50,140
And then they apparently
give you an AI one

1548
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,720
as well so you can test
AI in your scene with it,

1549
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,460
but I haven't experimented too much with
that to vouch for how well it works.

1550
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,760
So an important aspect
of today's example

1551
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,190
is that we've gone from having just
one scene to having two scenes.

1552
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:09,670
So I want to illustrate how we sort of
move between the scenes a little bit.

1553
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,090
And also, I realized we didn't
really cover the dungeon generator

1554
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:14,710
in code detail.

1555
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,850
But notice that I have
exposed a lot of things here.

1556
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:21,300
A floor prefab, wall
prefab, ceiling prefab.

1557
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,050
These are just the
cubes that are textured

1558
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:24,430
to be our floor, walls, and ceiling.

1559
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:27,190
We can just click and drag them
from the inspector into our scene,

1560
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,020
onto the components there.

1561
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,154
We have a character
controller reference here,

1562
01:20:32,154 --> 01:20:34,570
so that we can place the
character controller in our scene

1563
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,000
when we've generated the first block.

1564
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,350
We can basically take the transform
and set its position to whatever

1565
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:44,050
that x z is.

1566
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,360
And then a floor parent
and a walls parent.

1567
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,820
So the reason that we have
parent objects, actually,

1568
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,260
which we didn't look at before--

1569
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,040
whoops, I've lost track of where my--

1570
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,140
there it is.

1571
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,330
The reason that we have
parent objects here

1572
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:59,740
is because when we instantiate
all of the cubes in our scene,

1573
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:04,690
just sort of just instantiate them
without really thinking about it,

1574
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:06,610
it ends up--

1575
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,900
basically, I'll show you here.

1576
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:14,300
Well, first of all, I
don't know what this is.

1577
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,600
I think it's-- that's interesting.

1578
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,350
Oh, because I clicked
on the floor parent.

1579
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,269
Right, OK.

1580
01:21:21,269 --> 01:21:23,060
So you click on the
walls parent, actually.

1581
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,070
I didn't do that yet,
but it will actually

1582
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:27,340
show you where all of the objects
that are parented-- or that

1583
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,720
are dependent on that parent.

1584
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,700
So the floor parent here--

1585
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,220
see how many floor blocks there are?

1586
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:33,928
It's quite a lot.

1587
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:42,770
There's a lot of floor blocks here, and
in the walls parent there is even more.

1588
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:46,780
There's a lot of walls
and ceiling blocks,

1589
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,720
and if we just generate those
without assigning them a parent,

1590
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:55,300
it'll just fill up our
hierarchy there very messily.

1591
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,170
And it makes navigating our scene
during debugging very difficult.

1592
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,070
We don't need to see that we have
a million clones of the floor

1593
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:06,310
or the ceiling blocks
or the wall blocks.

1594
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:11,530
And so what we do is we just take all
of the cloned blocks and we just parent

1595
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,300
them to an object.

1596
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:16,720
And when you parent something to an
object, you get that little drop-down.

1597
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,290
Like, for example, this
first-person character.

1598
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:23,064
This FPS controller is the parent
of this first-person character.

1599
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:26,230
And so those are two separate objects
that both comprise the FPS controller,

1600
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,670
effectively.

1601
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:32,950
A parent is top-level, and its children
are therefore within this little arrow

1602
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,360
here, and it's collapsible.

1603
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,030
All of the things within the
play scene, for example--

1604
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:39,690
the play scene is the
parent to all of these.

1605
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,880
It's sort of like a folder
hierarchy type of thing.

1606
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,630
And so if you want to
clean up your scene,

1607
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,750
if you're instantiating a ton
of things, just effectively

1608
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,140
containerize them by putting
them into a parent object.

1609
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:57,640
And so we do that in our game with a
function called create child prefab.

1610
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:02,510
And so what create child prefab does
is, it does an instantiation as normal.

1611
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:07,470
Creates a prefab, instantiates
it, gives it a position xyz.

1612
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:10,850
Quaternion dot identity because we
don't want to apply any rotation to it.

1613
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:19,220
But my prefab dot transform dot
parent equals parent dot transform.

1614
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,610
Effectively linking
our-- we're assigning

1615
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:28,414
the parent field of that prefab's
transform to the parent's transform.

1616
01:23:28,414 --> 01:23:30,830
And that has the effect of
basically linking them together

1617
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:32,780
in a parent-child relationship.

1618
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:38,090
And that will allow us to
collapse and expand a list when

1619
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:39,750
one parent has a bunch of children.

1620
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:44,770
We can expand and contract in the
hierarchy view and save us a lot of--

1621
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,270
save us a bit of a headache in
terms of navigating our scene

1622
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:50,030
or we instantiate a lot of
things, which is fairly normal.

1623
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,430
So the actual may--

1624
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:56,910
I'll go over this fairly quickly.

1625
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:58,734
It's a fairly simple algorithm.

1626
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,650
And we talked about it on the screen,
and we don't have a ton of time.

1627
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,790
But basically we go z to x.

1628
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,750
The reason that we go z to x is
because in Unity, z and x are

1629
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:13,790
sort of like the ground axes, and a y
is sort of like that up and down axis.

1630
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,190
And so we don't want to
instantiate-- we're not

1631
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:19,827
really worried about navigating the
y-axis during our maze generator.

1632
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:22,160
Because all we're going to
do is instantiate four blocks

1633
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,400
on the y-axis during that phase.

1634
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:30,470
So we're basically taking our 2D
array, and we're iterating over it xy,

1635
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:36,110
and then we're mapping that to
Unity's xz, If that makes sense.

1636
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:41,670
Because notice the-- this
is our ground, right?

1637
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:46,430
So where this transform is, you
can see the ground, how this is x.

1638
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,320
The blue is z.

1639
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,467
And y is this axis here.

1640
01:24:50,467 --> 01:24:53,300
We're generating-- we're effectively
only concerned about generating

1641
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,460
on the ground, and then when
we generate a wall we just

1642
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,110
generate it four blocks high on the y.

1643
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,300
We don't think about the y.

1644
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,990
So that's why x and y
for our 2D array, but x

1645
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:08,270
and z for applying that array
to Unity's 3D coordinate system.

1646
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,580
Does that make sense?

1647
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,110
OK.

1648
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:15,830
So we're iterating over z and x.

1649
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:20,330
And then we're indexing into
our map data, z and x, which

1650
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,910
is exactly the same thing as y and x.

1651
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,610
And then we are creating a child prefab.

1652
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:29,150
If map data z x.

1653
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:34,640
So recall that our map data
is a 2D array of Booleans.

1654
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:39,760
And so if we have map data z x equal to
true, that means there's a wall there.

1655
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,060
It means that there's
a true in our array,

1656
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,930
so we should instantiate
a wall at that location.

1657
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:49,439
So we create three wall prefabs,
assign them to the walls parent

1658
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:51,230
so that they get
containerized within there

1659
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:52,938
so they don't clog up
our hierarchy view.

1660
01:25:56,206 --> 01:26:01,810
And then-- let me see here.

1661
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,140
And so if we don't--

1662
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:09,550
So if we've gone to our maze,
if we're generating our maze,

1663
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:14,800
and we get to our first tile
that's actually not a wall,

1664
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,610
so it's an empty space--

1665
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,950
So basically, the else here.

1666
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:22,010
So if mapped data zx is not
true, it's going to be false.

1667
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:26,470
So if that's the case, and
if not character placed--

1668
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,362
so character placed is just a Boolean.

1669
01:26:28,362 --> 01:26:29,320
It's a private Boolean.

1670
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,180
We don't want this to be
visible in our inspector.

1671
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,555
There's no purpose for it to
be visible in our inspector.

1672
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:36,880
This is just a Boolean for
us to use in our script.

1673
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,370
So we set that to false
by default because we

1674
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,910
haven't placed our character yet.

1675
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:42,826
But when we generate our
maze, we have to make

1676
01:26:42,826 --> 01:26:45,370
sure we put our character in a
spot that there isn't a wall.

1677
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,578
Because we obviously don't
want him trapped in a wall

1678
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:50,080
or clipping through the maze, right?

1679
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,550
So if not character placed, we're
going to set the character controller's

1680
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:55,570
transform.

1681
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:58,760
We're going to sense position and
rotation, which is a function.

1682
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:04,720
We're going to set it to x
and then y 1, and then z.

1683
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,620
And then no rotation, so
quaternion dot identity.

1684
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,860
And then set that to true.

1685
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:12,149
So therefore, this will
never be called again.

1686
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:14,440
So this only gets called on
that very first empty space

1687
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:18,520
that we go through our maze.

1688
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,610
And that's it for that.

1689
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:26,890
When we-- no matter what we do, whether
there's a wall in our maze or not,

1690
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:29,860
we're going to want to generate a
floor and a ceiling at that space.

1691
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,325
So-- that's, of course,
assuming that generate roof

1692
01:27:33,325 --> 01:27:37,000
is true which, recall, we made a
public Boolean in our inspector

1693
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,580
so that I could debug and show you guys
what the maze looks like from up above.

1694
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,850
So if generate roof--

1695
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:48,550
create a child prefab for ceiling
prefab of x 4 z, so a bit higher up.

1696
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:51,760
And then no matter what,
always want a floor.

1697
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,570
So create a floor prefab at x 0 z.

1698
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:56,910
So down below.

1699
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,450
And our character controller
gets placed at, recall, x 1 z,

1700
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:02,020
so just above the floor.

1701
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:05,500
The assignment is actually--
part of the assignment

1702
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:08,730
is generate a hole in the floor.

1703
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:13,140
And if there's a hole in the floor and
the character falls through the hole,

1704
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,390
should get a game over, right?

1705
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,515
So you're going to need to
create a game over scene

1706
01:28:16,515 --> 01:28:18,170
or we need to transition to that scene.

1707
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,000
And then we're going to need to check
to see whether the character's transform

1708
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,150
has gone below a certain amount.

1709
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,520
It's all fairly easy stuff to do.

1710
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,920
But you'll look to do
some of that in here.

1711
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,560
And then the actual maze
data function is here.

1712
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,490
I won't go over it in detail,
but it's the algorithm

1713
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:40,770
that we talked about before, where
we choose direction to move randomly,

1714
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,240
and we choose a random
number of steps to move,

1715
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,880
clamp that value within the
constraints of the maze,

1716
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:50,660
and then set every tile
that we explore to false.

1717
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,540
And that has the effect
of creating the maze.

1718
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:56,280
And then we just return that data back
to our function as just a 2D array.

1719
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,989
Notice that in C Sharp,
to create a 2D array,

1720
01:28:59,989 --> 01:29:02,530
it's a little bit different than
in a lot of other languages.

1721
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,114
It has its own set of syntax for that.

1722
01:29:04,114 --> 01:29:06,654
You have the array syntax that
you're probably familiar with,

1723
01:29:06,654 --> 01:29:08,310
but then you also have this comma.

1724
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:12,790
And that comma is to designate that
there are two arguments to that index

1725
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:13,780
syntax here.

1726
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:18,000
Just means an x should go here and
a y should go there, basically.

1727
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,060
Or y, x.

1728
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,720
And that's 2D array.

1729
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,740
And you can make it as many
degrees as you want to.

1730
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:26,300
Just add more commas to it.

1731
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:32,350
And notice that to actually allocate the
memory that we want for that 2D array--

1732
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:35,170
new bool, maze size, maze size.

1733
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:37,120
So our maze is always square shaped.

1734
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,690
Same-- and you could
easily make this maze

1735
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,630
x, maze y if you wanted
to, to make it rectangular.

1736
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:48,100
So you need to have two public
variables instead of one.

1737
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,170
And all of this is fairly
visible to the inspector, too.

1738
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:55,480
In our dungeon generator you can
see I made a tiles to remove, 350.

1739
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,360
So that means that our maze
is going to cut out 350 tiles,

1740
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,030
and as soon as it cuts
out 350 tiles, it's done.

1741
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,250
And then our maze size is 30 by 30.

1742
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,620
So that means there's going
to be 900 tiles in our maze.

1743
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:09,100
So you can tailor this to
whatever you want in order

1744
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:15,850
to produce sparse or denser
mazes to your liking.

1745
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:21,060
So any questions as to how
the code for that works?

1746
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,900
More or less.

1747
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,910
So now we'll actually get
to the scenes part of it.

1748
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:27,100
And so transitioning betw--

1749
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,060
oh, yeah.

1750
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:31,510
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking,
like, for a smaller

1751
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,980
game like that, that works great.

1752
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,920
But for a larger game, wouldn't
you want to model the walls

1753
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:42,300
as 2D kind of objects, and the
ceiling, instead of a whole cube?

1754
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,540
COLTON OGDEN: Oh, yeah.

1755
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:46,750
So for a small game, is it ideal--

1756
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:51,880
more ideal for the walls to be rendered
as one discrete object as opposed

1757
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,840
to several cubes?

1758
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,180
Yeah, absolutely.

1759
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,380
That's 100% true.

1760
01:30:56,380 --> 01:31:00,460
And actually, Minecraft is an
example of this sort of idea

1761
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,040
that you think would
work, but they actually

1762
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,010
consolidate all their geometry after
they've generated it in this way

1763
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:10,847
and produce, like, models
that are more optimized.

1764
01:31:10,847 --> 01:31:13,180
You think that you're interacting
with this world that's

1765
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,187
a bunch of these little
blocks, all separate.

1766
01:31:15,187 --> 01:31:17,020
But it's actually one
big piece of geometry,

1767
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,900
and then it dynamically figures out
where you're hitting and removes

1768
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,060
and adds blocks as needed.

1769
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,026
And there's some cool videos on
YouTube as to how to do this in Unity,

1770
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:26,650
too, which I looked at a long time ago.

1771
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,970
And it kind of shows you--

1772
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:31,600
you can actually dynamically create
meshes and vertices and stuff in Unity,

1773
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,970
and then create objects that
way, which is really cool.

1774
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:37,620
But that's a little bit
more on the advanced side.

1775
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,560
But yeah, absolutely.

1776
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,090
For an actual implementation of
this, a simple but more efficient way

1777
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:48,070
to do it would just be to have
one solid, large, wall object.

1778
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,590
That's as tall as you need
it to be, and maybe as

1779
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:54,220
wide as you need it to be for one
character, and have that work.

1780
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:56,760
But for simplicity's sake and
to illustrate the algorithm,

1781
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,400
we were just using the cubes.

1782
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,030
Yeah, exactly.

1783
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,500
But yeah, good point.

1784
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,270
That's 100% true.

1785
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,810
All right, multiple scenes.

1786
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:11,080
So the way that we do this--

1787
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,320
so I'm going to go into my text editor.

1788
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:22,290
Whoops So the-- grab pick-ups script.

1789
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:29,640
So grab pick-ups is a component that's
attached to the character controller,

1790
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,600
because he's going to
be picking up pick-ups.

1791
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,100
And what the grab pick-up
script effectively does is,

1792
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:43,710
the character controller
built-in collide

1793
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:47,040
has this function that you can define
for it called on-controller collider

1794
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,480
hits, where anything that collides
with the controller's collider

1795
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,700
will trigger this callback function.

1796
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:59,790
And you can grab the information about
the object that you collided with

1797
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:02,530
and then perform some
sort of logic on that.

1798
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,040
And so it's actually calling
this function every single time

1799
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:09,951
we collide with any of the tiles
or the blocks in our scene as well.

1800
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:11,700
There's just no logic
to account for them,

1801
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,820
so it's just effectively
an empty function call.

1802
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:24,840
But if it's the case that the
game object has a tag of pick-up--

1803
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,460
which we've set in our Unity editor,
and I'll show you how to do that--

1804
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:32,730
then we should play a sound
from our pick-up sound source.

1805
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:34,020
And then we should--

1806
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:37,590
using-- you actually used
this in the last lecture,

1807
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,480
but only within the same scene.

1808
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,500
We're going to call scene
manager dot load scene, play.

1809
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,440
And you need Unity engine
dot scene management.

1810
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,770
Using unity engine dot scene
management at the top of your script

1811
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,720
in order to use this.

1812
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,690
And load scene effectively
just will literally just

1813
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,850
load a scene by its name.

1814
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:58,790
And we're doing that
in a couple of places.

1815
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:00,165
So we're actually doing it there.

1816
01:34:00,165 --> 01:34:04,590
But remember, we had the title scene,
which had the same sort of thing.

1817
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:08,790
You press Enter, and you
load the play scene, right?

1818
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:12,600
So this load scene on input
component that I created

1819
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,490
is attached to a text
field in the title scene.

1820
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,870
And all we're doing
here is in the update,

1821
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:27,850
we're just saying hey, if input dot
get access submit is equal to 1,

1822
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,980
then scene manager dot load scene play.

1823
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:33,480
Almost the same-- kind of almost
the same code, only in this case

1824
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,585
we're querying Unity's input.

1825
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:39,160
It has a global input manager, get axis.

1826
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,490
So it has several axes,
is how it defines it.

1827
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:44,250
Different methods of input.

1828
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:48,610
And then it defines them by keywords,
so in this case submit is a keyword.

1829
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:52,170
And you define-- you map those keys--

1830
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:55,740
or you map those keywords to
specific keys and input sources

1831
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:57,330
on whatever platform you're targeting.

1832
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:01,410
In this case, submit is synonymous
with either Enter or Return,

1833
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:03,300
depending on which platform we're using.

1834
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:07,380
And it could have other meanings
if we're exporting this to Xbox

1835
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:09,840
or if we're exporting it
to the web, or if we're

1836
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,460
exporting it to a mobile phone.

1837
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,740
There's a lot of
different ways it changes.

1838
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:19,214
And so the way that it
checks is it will be 0 or 1,

1839
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,630
specifically, so we can say
if input dot get access submit

1840
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:25,840
equals 1, scene manager load scene play.

1841
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,290
And it won't let you do if input dot get
access submit, because it's explicitly

1842
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:33,690
expecting integer and it
will throw an error if you're

1843
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:35,520
trying to use it like a Boolean.

1844
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:42,870
So we need to use this equals,
equals one to test for equivalence.

1845
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,760
And that's all we're
effectively doing there.

1846
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:57,540
Now, the interesting thing is, when
we reload the scene for the pick-up

1847
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:01,500
for the maze, there's a soundtrack
playing in the background.

1848
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,370
And we want the soundtrack to
constantly be playing the same thing

1849
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:07,680
and to loop, right?

1850
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,650
The sound effect-- we don't want
it to start up immediately again

1851
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:12,840
and start up from the
very beginning again.

1852
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,900
We kind of want this
seamless sort of feel to it.

1853
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,960
And so how do we think we
can solve this problem?

1854
01:36:24,014 --> 01:36:25,680
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't play again when?

1855
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,727
When you reload the scene?

1856
01:36:27,727 --> 01:36:28,560
COLTON OGDEN: Sorry?

1857
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,420
AUDIENCE: You don't want it to start
over when you reload the scene?

1858
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,336
COLTON OGDEN: Correct.

1859
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:37,120
So any ideas as to how we would do this?

1860
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
AUDIENCE: Put level one only
in the beginning or something?

1861
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,130
[INAUDIBLE]

1862
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,830
COLTON OGDEN: Well, so whenever
we collide with the pickup,

1863
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:46,269
we reload the scene
completely from scratch.

1864
01:36:46,269 --> 01:36:48,810
And so when you reload a scene,
it destroys every game object

1865
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:51,000
in the scene, including
all the objects that

1866
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,380
have audio sources attached to them.

1867
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,650
And so when it reloads the
scene, it reinstantiates

1868
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:58,691
all of the game objects in the scene,
including those with audio sources,

1869
01:36:58,691 --> 01:37:00,660
and retriggers their playing.

1870
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:03,933
So what we want to do is
prevent this from happening.

1871
01:37:03,933 --> 01:37:07,770
AUDIENCE: Just have a counter and
when you get the first pickup then

1872
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:09,020
it goes to 1.

1873
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:12,590
And then you say if less
than 1, play the sound.

1874
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,170
COLTON OGDEN: That will have the effect
of-- so you're saying have a counter,

1875
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:20,670
and when--

1876
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:21,461
AUDIENCE: Or, yeah.

1877
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:22,430
True-false would do.

1878
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:24,780
Boolean would be better at this.

1879
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:28,050
COLTON OGDEN: So have a counter or
true-false when you load the scene,

1880
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,240
it starts the music.

1881
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,490
But what happens when we
reload the scene from scratch

1882
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,026
and the audio that was
playing gets deleted?

1883
01:37:34,026 --> 01:37:37,305
AUDIENCE: Can you transport
certain objects between scenes?

1884
01:37:37,305 --> 01:37:39,930
COLTON OGDEN: Can you transport
certain objects between scenes?

1885
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:42,210
Effectively, you can.

1886
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:47,440
There is a function called
don't destroy on load, actually.

1887
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,560
So what that d-- it's
a Unity function, which

1888
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,490
allows you to preserve an
object as it is between scenes.

1889
01:37:54,490 --> 01:38:01,620
So if you don't want your object with
the music to destroy itself and then

1890
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,140
reinstantiate on load--

1891
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:07,530
well, technically, just
don't destroy itself.

1892
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:10,257
Just do don't destroy on
load at the game object.

1893
01:38:10,257 --> 01:38:12,840
And so this don't destroy, we
apply this to our audio source--

1894
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,480
our whisper source, it's called--

1895
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,780
in the scene.

1896
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:19,950
The only problem with this
is if we reinstantiate--

1897
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:23,490
or if we don't destroy on load this
object, it's going to persevere.

1898
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:26,220
But when we reload the scene,
it's going instantiate a new one.

1899
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,795
So what's the effect
of this going to be?

1900
01:38:28,795 --> 01:38:31,420
We're going to have two audio
sources playing at the same time.

1901
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,920
What happens when we do another one?

1902
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,670
You're going to have three audio
sources playing at the same time.

1903
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:37,381
So for every time you
go to a next level,

1904
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:39,630
you're going to add the same
audio track to the scene.

1905
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:43,150
It's going to be very
annoying very quickly.

1906
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:47,000
The way that we avoid this happening
is by making what's called a singleton.

1907
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,640
So what a singleton is is a
class that can only effectively

1908
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,110
be instantiated one time.

1909
01:38:54,630 --> 01:39:02,445
And we do this by creating a static
variable here called don't destroy.

1910
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:09,420
No, we call it instance, which
is of type don't destroy.

1911
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:12,150
So it's this component here, right?

1912
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:15,270
And so the don't destroy
class as a whole has

1913
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:17,280
this static variable called instance.

1914
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,870
And we set it to null by default.
And we haven't instantiated

1915
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:23,710
a don't destroy component yet.

1916
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:28,620
And what this ensures, in
our scene, by the logic

1917
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,750
we have in the awake function, awake
is almost the same thing as start.

1918
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,500
It just means whenever--
you can pause an object

1919
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,560
and it will awake from its pause state.

1920
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,830
But awake also gets called when
an object gets instantiated.

1921
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:48,030
So if the instance is set to null
on awake, instance equals this,

1922
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:49,500
so this don't destroy.

1923
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,660
So whatever this is
being called from, this

1924
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,410
don't destroy will be the instance.

1925
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:56,130
Whenever the first don't destroy
component is in our scene.

1926
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:58,710
The very first maze that we generate.

1927
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,530
The sound source instance will be this.

1928
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:04,800
And then we set don't destroy
on load for the game object that

1929
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:12,120
is holding that don't destroy or don't
destroy component, that audio source.

1930
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:18,360
But if the instance is not equal
to this, so if we've awoken

1931
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,870
and this is level 2,
for example, instance

1932
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:27,150
is going to be set to the don't destroy
component on the don't destroy on load

1933
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:29,700
object that we created
in the first maze.

1934
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,270
Because we did this logic here.

1935
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:37,630
And so it's going to try and instantiate
a second don't destroy component.

1936
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:40,170
It's going to destroy
another sound source.

1937
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:41,730
But instance is not going to be null.

1938
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:45,690
Instance is going to be
equal to that first object.

1939
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:51,130
So we say, if instance is not
equal to this, destroy game object.

1940
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:54,660
So this is going to be from the
standpoint of the second don't

1941
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,157
destroy that got created.

1942
01:40:56,157 --> 01:40:58,440
AUDIENCE: So a singleton
basically persists.

1943
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,900
COLTON OGDEN: The singleton
will persist indefinitely

1944
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,640
upon its first instantiation.

1945
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,770
And there will only
ever be one singleton.

1946
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:07,174
This is a very basic,
very common pattern

1947
01:41:07,174 --> 01:41:09,090
in software engineering
for ensuring they only

1948
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,510
have one object of a given type
present throughout your entire project.

1949
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:18,720
But this is how we prevent multiple
sound sources from being instantiated.

1950
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,810
We always ensure that only
one object with that component

1951
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:25,830
gets instantiated at once, and any
future instantiations of that object

1952
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,890
get destroyed immediately, assuming
that they aren't that first object.

1953
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,560
If they are that first
object, instance will not--

1954
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:34,450
instance will equal this, and
so it will still skip this part,

1955
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:36,920
and so it will stay alive.

1956
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,129
So any questions as to how the
persevering through multiple scenes

1957
01:41:40,129 --> 01:41:41,170
works for a sound source?

1958
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:46,790
OK.

1959
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:48,210
That's how we get multiple scenes.

1960
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:48,952
So fog.

1961
01:41:48,952 --> 01:41:51,410
We looked at fog already, but
I have a few screenshots here

1962
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:55,400
to kind of help illustrate what
fog has looked like over the years.

1963
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,800
So fog looks pretty
unconvincing in this screenshot.

1964
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,170
This is Turok for the N64.

1965
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:03,740
It's just-- kind of looks as if, you
know, sort of at a certain distance,

1966
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:06,560
a very dense sheet of fog has appeared.

1967
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,900
And you can actually make this
happen in Unity by setting the--

1968
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,950
there's a curve, a fog
curve that I believe you

1969
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,732
can manipulate that will effectively--

1970
01:42:15,732 --> 01:42:18,440
the algorithm that determines how
the color gets summed to things

1971
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:22,280
far away is very fast as
opposed to gradual or linear.

1972
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,440
So you can make it just
exponential, effectively,

1973
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:27,830
and make it look as if the
fog is incredibly dense

1974
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:30,320
and starts almost at a
very fixed spot and have

1975
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,600
the rest of this area in
front of you look normal.

1976
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,240
Here is another example--

1977
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,970
Star Wars Shadows of the Empire,
one of my favorite N64 games

1978
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:39,650
which has the same look.

1979
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:43,190
And so in this era, you can see
fog is very distinguishable.

1980
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:46,040
Very artificial looking,
because it's very tinted.

1981
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,570
In this case it looks very blue.

1982
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:50,630
In this case it looks very pale blue.

1983
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:52,070
This is Silent Hill.

1984
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:55,400
And Silent Hill looks
realer, more realistic,

1985
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,340
but kind of the same thing at play here.

1986
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:05,180
You have a very pale gray metallic blue
color, and the density in this case

1987
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,460
is very high.

1988
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:09,060
The density is much higher.

1989
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:13,430
Well, maybe close to as high as it is
in our game that we're showing today.

1990
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:16,190
But it's effectively the same
thing, just with a different color.

1991
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:20,480
And they use it to great effect in here,
not only for sort of this aesthetic

1992
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:24,230
to make you look as if you're
in some sort of desolate town.

1993
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:27,715
But also to dynamically load objects
or to prevent rendering objects

1994
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,090
that are a certain distance away.

1995
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:31,825
And to optimize performance
on hardware that was severely

1996
01:43:31,825 --> 01:43:33,950
limited at the time, which
was Playstation 1, which

1997
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:36,560
is a fairly weak console.

1998
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,610
And then here is Shadow of the
Colossus for PS4, which just came out

1999
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:42,770
not too long ago, and we
can see fog is still being

2000
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:44,717
used but it looks photo-realistic.

2001
01:43:44,717 --> 01:43:46,550
And there's probably a
lot more that they're

2002
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,530
doing they probably have
several layers of fog,

2003
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:52,700
they probably have textures
and transparent objects

2004
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:56,240
that are simulating fog, and a lot
of more complicated things like that.

2005
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,020
Fog that only hangs
at a certain distance

2006
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,810
so it looks like fog
going over the lake.

2007
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:02,250
There's a lot of things
here, but it's the same idea.

2008
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:04,625
And they probably have the
same sort of foundational base

2009
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:07,344
fog present throughout the scene.

2010
01:44:07,344 --> 01:44:09,510
And then here's our game,
just to show how it looks.

2011
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:10,740
You can barely even see it.

2012
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:12,980
But it does give you
this sort of, like, lost

2013
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:17,840
in a really dangerous maze feeling,
which-- and it's super easy to do.

2014
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,470
And it can save you performance
and it can add a lot of aesthetic

2015
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,000
to your game.

2016
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,070
And so the last big thing we'll talk
about today is Unity 2D, actually.

2017
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,925
So I'm going to go back into--

2018
01:44:28,925 --> 01:44:29,945
oh, questions about fog.

2019
01:44:29,945 --> 01:44:31,820
I know that was a pretty
high-level overview.

2020
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,800
Over looked at we
looked at how it applies

2021
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:39,540
in the settings and questions as to how
it works or how to get work in Unity?

2022
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:40,910
OK.

2023
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:45,350
So we're going to go ahead
and look at our title scene.

2024
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,730
And so we looked at
this earlier, briefly,

2025
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:50,140
but I want to go ahead and
show you the components.

2026
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:51,890
So I'm going to take
a look at our canvas.

2027
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,859
If you double-click on
something you'll zoom out.

2028
01:44:54,859 --> 01:44:57,650
And so it will automatically detect
sort of what your resolution is

2029
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:01,220
and scale the canvas
accordingly in your scene view.

2030
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,850
There's a 2D button here.

2031
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:06,460
I'm going to go ahead and
go to my default layout.

2032
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:09,974
I'm going to click on the canvas.

2033
01:45:09,974 --> 01:45:12,890
Notice that it shifted things a
little bit because now I have a larger

2034
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,340
window that's going to be rendered to.

2035
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:19,220
I'm going to click on the canvas,
and then I'm going to go to 2D mode.

2036
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:22,670
And then notice when you
click on 2D and 3D mode,

2037
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,690
you go instantly into seeing
it as if you're manipulating it

2038
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:28,610
in a 2D engine versus a 3D engine.

2039
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,300
And then going back to 3D, now
it's a three-dimensional plane

2040
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,930
that you're actually looking at.

2041
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:37,220
So in 2D mode, you can easily sort of
navigate it, right click and drag it

2042
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,492
around.

2043
01:45:38,492 --> 01:45:40,970
I'm going to go here, like this.

2044
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:44,120
And these are very simple
components that you can just

2045
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,980
interact with as a GUI.

2046
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:50,030
Now, the main thing that you
need to get any of this to work

2047
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:52,470
is the canvas, which is here.

2048
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:58,760
So if you right click and then go to UI,
you can go to canvas, if you want to,

2049
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,010
or you can just add any of
these things that you want,

2050
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:04,400
and it will automatically
add a canvas for you.

2051
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:09,300
Because a canvas is necessary for
all of the Unity UI rendering stuff.

2052
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,380
So if I were to just add
a text on an empty scene,

2053
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:17,810
it'll just create a new brand
new canvas and an event system.

2054
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:23,240
The event system is just how Unity
talks to the canvas and all the UI

2055
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:27,170
elements of your canvas, given mouse
and keyboard input and stuff like that.

2056
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:31,460
It's nothing that you necessarily
have to worry about or use.

2057
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:36,440
But the canvas is the sort of
overall container for all GUI stuff

2058
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,400
that you do.

2059
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,350
Now if I click on the tile
text or the enter text,

2060
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:42,481
notice that they are
children of the canvas.

2061
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:43,730
So they are within the canvas.

2062
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,170
The canvas is their parent.

2063
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:46,940
The title text, I can move it around.

2064
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,710
Notice that it snaps.

2065
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:51,430
it's got my snapping functionality.

2066
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:54,420
I can set it up there,
it will snap to the top.

2067
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,430
It'll-- yeah.

2068
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:56,570
It's pretty handy.

2069
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:59,420
You can scale the bounding box.

2070
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:02,240
It doesn't scale the
actual text, but the--

2071
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:06,230
notice that I do have
right justification,

2072
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:08,480
centering, left justification.

2073
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,190
Those sorts of helping--

2074
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:12,880
those sort of features.

2075
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,910
I can increase the font size
via slider, so I can immediately

2076
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:19,790
see without having to
edit some code and then

2077
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:23,660
reload the project what changing
some of these values will look like.

2078
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,820
I can easily change
the color in real time,

2079
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:27,800
so I can get a sense of how that looks.

2080
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:32,870
If you wanted some sort of
slimy, Dread50 look, I guess.

2081
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:36,110
And you can also assign materials
to as well, which is kind of cool.

2082
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:39,070
Which I haven't explored too much
in detail, but you have that option.

2083
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:46,130
If you want to give it a material
instead of a color, materialed font.

2084
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:48,860
Because ultimately, all
this stuff is still 3D,

2085
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:50,930
but Unity presents it in
a way that makes it look

2086
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:52,460
as if you're interacting with it in 2D.

2087
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,000
It's pretty nice.

2088
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,333
AUDIENCE: When you put it in
2D form, when you hit play,

2089
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:56,970
it's going to open up to that?

2090
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:57,720
COLTON OGDEN: Yep.

2091
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,740
AUDIENCE: And then how do you
transition to the rest of the game?

2092
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:03,031
COLTON OGDEN: So the transition
to the rest of the game

2093
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:06,740
is in the load scene on input here.

2094
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:09,480
So the script that we looked at earlier.

2095
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,630
So this is assigned to
one of those text labels.

2096
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:12,960
So I just gave it to the--

2097
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,090
I forget.

2098
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:15,370
I think it's the Enter text.

2099
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:19,610
So I gave it this load scene on input,
just because it's the Enter text,

2100
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:22,197
it seemed appropriate.

2101
01:48:22,197 --> 01:48:23,780
Could put it on anything in the scene.

2102
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,710
It doesn't matter.

2103
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:26,600
As long as it has this
update function, which

2104
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:30,995
then has this if input dot get access
submit equals 1, and then recall--

2105
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:37,640
go into the Project Settings, input.

2106
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,430
All these axes here are
defined for you automatically.

2107
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:45,200
And then you can choose what they
map to, but submit, as you can see,

2108
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:47,880
positive button is return.

2109
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:51,440
So if submit is equal to 1, when you
press Return it will be equal to 1,

2110
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,880
effectively.

2111
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,130
And it gets mapped to other
buttons, depending on what

2112
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:59,250
input sources you have on your device.

2113
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,550
But you can check what
it is on your computer

2114
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:04,190
just by going to Axes
in your Input Manager.

2115
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:07,580
So it's, once again, Edit,
Project Settings, Input.

2116
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:09,423
And then you can see all the axes here.

2117
01:49:09,423 --> 01:49:12,595
AUDIENCE: So that, the 2D scene,
that's just a scene in itself.

2118
01:49:12,595 --> 01:49:14,720
COLTON OGDEN: That's a
scene in itself, completely.

2119
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,534
It has a camera, so we are--

2120
01:49:17,534 --> 01:49:19,325
the camera renders--
the thing about canvas

2121
01:49:19,325 --> 01:49:21,170
is it's kind of separate
from the camera,

2122
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:25,590
so it gets rendered onto whatever
the camera's rendering separately.

2123
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:28,100
But the camera in this
case, what I've done,

2124
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,980
because if by default we just
render the camera and the UI,

2125
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,450
it's going to look just like this.

2126
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:35,420
It's going to look like the sky
with Dread50 and Press Enter.

2127
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:40,170
That's not the aesthetic that
we want, so I take the camera,

2128
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,960
and then you can give it a background.

2129
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:45,910
So by default, the background
is that sky, is the skybox.

2130
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:48,630
And so I set clear flags.

2131
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,710
Clear flags are same
thing as background.

2132
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:54,270
So whatever, there's no
geometry or anything.

2133
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:57,900
Clear-- this clear
color, clear flag, this

2134
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,042
gets drawn to before any
geometry in the scene, basically.

2135
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,940
So clear flags, solid
color in this case,

2136
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:08,250
and then just black,
using a color picker.

2137
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:11,220
So super easy, super nice.

2138
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:16,000
And then this UI, this canvas, will
get drawn on top of this camera.

2139
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,850
So that's what produces the sort
of combined effect of having the UI

2140
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,950
text and then the black background.

2141
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,860
And then that Enter Text,
having that component,

2142
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:30,090
that checks for the submit input because
that's what Enter and Return map to.

2143
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:39,346
That is what lets us transition from
the current scene to the play scene.

2144
01:50:39,346 --> 01:50:41,220
And so there are a lot
of other cool features

2145
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:45,540
that these labels and such have.

2146
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:49,170
For example, being able to
set its anchor position.

2147
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:53,310
So depending on what device you're
shipping to, you might want--

2148
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:57,690
you know you're going to have multiple
screen sizes and screen resolutions.

2149
01:50:57,690 --> 01:51:01,830
So you can say, I want
this label to always

2150
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:06,870
be at the very top middle of
my scene, and I can do this

2151
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:11,550
by clicking this little box here,
which is the anchor point selector,

2152
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:13,360
and then just clicking that.

2153
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,560
And so that will always anchor
Dread50's text to that top middle,

2154
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,610
no matter what our resolution is.

2155
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:21,510
It will always be there.

2156
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:28,080
And there's a lot that
you can do on top of that.

2157
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,740
And you can do that with any UI
component, just relative positioning

2158
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,210
depending on the resolution.

2159
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:35,712
And the nice thing about
Unity, too, if you go to Game,

2160
01:51:35,712 --> 01:51:37,920
you can actually choose--
sorry, in the second menu--

2161
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,780
you can choose a lot of aspect ratios.

2162
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:42,030
So 5:04 doesn't look that great.

2163
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:43,920
4:03 doesn't look that great.

2164
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,910
16:10, 16:9, and then standalone.

2165
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:55,140
So standalone is the default
export size of your platform.

2166
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:58,770
But you can choo-- you can have it--

2167
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:02,220
you can test different resolutions,
and you can also add more, too.

2168
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:07,230
You can add a fixed resolution
if you want, or aspect ratio.

2169
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,899
And do a lot of cool things that way.

2170
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:12,940
So you don't have to necessarily test
it physically on different devices.

2171
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,898
Although it's very good
to so you can make sure

2172
01:52:14,898 --> 01:52:17,020
that you're not blowing
up your hardware.

2173
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,420
But you have that option.

2174
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:27,090
So any questions as to how Unity
2D works and how the canvas works

2175
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:30,600
or how we've gotten
the simple UI to work?

2176
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,630
Part of the assignment will be--
and we'll take a look at that now,

2177
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:35,010
actually.

2178
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:38,710
So assignment 9, we talked about this
already, about the gaps in the floor.

2179
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,370
But this will be part of
the maze generator, right?

2180
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:43,170
Because it's where we
generate, ultimately.

2181
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:46,470
Or, the generates--
the maze instantiator.

2182
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:50,340
The actual part of the maze generator
that creates the physical maze.

2183
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:52,210
But create gaps in the floor.

2184
01:52:52,210 --> 01:52:56,740
And then when the player falls through,
approximately two blocks below, which

2185
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,570
you can set--

2186
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:01,190
check the transform is-- the y
position is less than a certain amount.

2187
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:04,500
It should be less than 0.

2188
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,810
I think it's based on
the top part of it.

2189
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:11,050
Then you should transition to a
new screen that says Game Over.

2190
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:14,160
So create a new scene, very
similar to the first scene

2191
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,710
that we looked at, which
was just the title screen,

2192
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:18,570
and you can probably copy most of that.

2193
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:21,720
But that scene should say
Game Over, and then pressing

2194
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:25,890
Enter there should load the tile scene.

2195
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:29,050
And then, lastly, add a
text object to the play

2196
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:32,610
scene that just keeps track of how
many levels you've navigated through.

2197
01:53:32,610 --> 01:53:35,610
And you can probably do this with
some kind of static variable.

2198
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:39,090
But any solution that
accomplishes it is welcome.

2199
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:43,050
But altogether, all pretty
easy pieces to put together.

2200
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:46,191
That was this week, which was
Dread Halls and our first foray

2201
01:53:46,191 --> 01:53:47,190
into first-person games.

2202
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:48,870
Next week we'll look at Portal.

2203
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:52,920
It won't look necessarily this good,
but it will look similar to this.

2204
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,260
This is a screenshot from Portal itself.

2205
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:58,140
But we'll look at how we
can render to textures,

2206
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:01,414
how we can cast rays from our
character, our first person controller,

2207
01:54:01,414 --> 01:54:04,080
how we can actually make it look
as if we have a weapon or a gun

2208
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,600
or a portal gun, which
is not too difficult.

2209
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:12,870
You just have two parent, basically, a
model to your first-person controller.

2210
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:16,837
And then, when we walk through a portal,
how do we transition from one portal

2211
01:54:16,837 --> 01:54:17,670
to the other portal?

2212
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:22,620
So just a-- you know teleport,
your transform to another position.

2213
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:24,180
But that was that.

2214
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,960
Next week is Portal, and I
will see you all next time.
