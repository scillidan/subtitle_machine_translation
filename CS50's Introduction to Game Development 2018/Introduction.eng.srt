COLTON OGDEN: Hi.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,420
My name is Colton Ogden, and
I am the course instructor

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,030
for GD50, which is CS50's
Introduction to Game Development.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,700
CS50 is to game programming what CS50
is to general-purpose programming

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,430
and problem solving, ultimately
a jumping-off point for students

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,890
that might have a little bit
of programming experience,

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,220
but who haven't necessarily gotten their
hands dirty with game programming yet.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,650
GD50 adopts a case study style
approach whereby week by week,

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,010
we'll look at a specific
game, and we'll analyze it,

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,890
figuring out what the parts do and
how they form a playable whole.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,790
We'll look at games like Pong,
Breakout, Super Mario Bros., Legend

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,239
of Zelda, Portal, and many more.

13
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,030
For the first three
quarters of the course,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,650
students will use Lua and LOVE 2D,
a 2D game development framework,

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,530
and then transition in the
latter quarter to C# in Unity,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,600
a very popular modern game engine.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,570
Ultimately, lots of programming,
lots of ideas, and lots of fun

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,010
await students interested in the course.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,490
My name is Colton
Ogden, and this is GD50.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,877
