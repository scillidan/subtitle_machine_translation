00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,280
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,529
tutorial using kdenlive the free video

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,419
editing software in this video we're

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:11,820
going to be adding in a video clip that

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,490
has existing audio and will be swapping

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
out the audio from that video and just

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,869
adding in music instead of the audio

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,089
that the video came with so if you want

9
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,170
to follow along I'm just gonna be

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,419
downloading some project clips from

11
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:27,660
pixabay and from freesound.org the pics

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,759
of a clip we're going to find first of

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,320
all I'm gonna change my search to videos

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,020
and I'll search for this video called

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,190
runoff I'm thinking rain and runoff at

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,970
the same time it's just a video of rain

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,530
falling against a window so I left click

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,310
on this it's what it sounds like it's

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,050
just some raindrops dripping down some

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,630
glass so we'll download this video click

21
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,770
free download I already have it

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,450
downloaded I think I did the 1920 by

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,670
1080 go ahead and download and download

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,590
this video and then I'm going to also be

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,990
using going to freesound.org I just

26
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,970
searched music and this search might

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,589
change at the time that you surged up

28
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,390
with different options here but today I

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,100
was able to just find this music here

30
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,690
play this show is kind of the wave form

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,140
of it

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,120
I'll left-click on this file and this

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,940
files by JP music 82 and the last one

34
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,200
was from most media both of them are

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,940
really released under the Creative

36
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,010
Commons Ebro license so we really

37
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,270
appreciate these users sharing these

38
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,100
files with us go ahead and just hit

39
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,570
download and you can download this I

40
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,130
already have it downloaded so they are

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,620
in my downloads folder and then to bring

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,690
those in we can just click here we've

43
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,850
done before you can go clip I mean that

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,850
project add clip or you can just click

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,640
on this under your project bin you can

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,070
click on this add clip button and it

47
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,560
brings up a dialog to add the clip in so

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,659
maybe we'll add the mp3 file the music

49
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,940
file this way and hit OK and now we have

50
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,450
our music file but you can also drag and

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,369
drop so if you have your doc your your

52
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,530
folder open or your files you're viewing

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,669
them in the browser here come back we'll

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,258
just drag and drop this video of the

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,209
rain runoff into our project bin

56
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,069
remember we always have to have it in

57
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,870
the project bin if we try to drag it

58
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,249
down to the timeline it won't work

59
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,560
nothing will go into the timeline unless

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,769
it's first in our project bin and so

61
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,939
from our project bin we can kind of

62
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,310
scroll this over and see I rearranged

63
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,400
this since the last video and so if we

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,620
can actually click and drag different

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,569
parts to anywhere we want to but I'm

66
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,999
gonna keep my project bin right here

67
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,499
right there so if yours looks a little

68
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,999
different than mine you can rearrange it

69
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,799
and look I actually opened up a third

70
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,870
window now oh I have clip properties now

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,999
as a separate thing and it was a little

72
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,189
tab down here so we'll we'll keep it

73
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,859
there as a tab so what that does it just

74
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,329
creates a tab at the bottom that we can

75
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,129
toggle between just like we were with

76
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,919
our project monitor and clip monitor and

77
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,049
we can watch our runoff see what this

78
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,930
video looks like awesome so to get

79
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,459
started we need to put it down into our

80
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,019
into our timeline

81
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,519
so I'll left click on this video file

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,309
and I'll move it to video 1 track and

83
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,590
then our audio file I'll left-click on

84
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,499
and put it on to the audio audio one

85
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,809
track so now we have these I want to

86
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,950
zoom in and see them a little bit closer

87
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,359
so I'm gonna come to the bottom right

88
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,909
here and just with the scroll bar scroll

89
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,169
in to zoom in so I can see it a little

90
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,049
bit better now I can click if I hold and

91
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,659
hold down on my left mouse cursor I can

92
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,519
actually it's called scrubbing I can

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,799
scrub along and watch the video and

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,680
listen to the audio and so I don't do

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,999
too much of that because I'm recording

96
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,769
the video at the same time my computer

97
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,349
is getting a little overloaded I think

98
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,699
anyway and then um I want to get rid of

99
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,139
some of these video tracks we have three

100
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,939
video tracks you don't have to do this

101
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,290
but it's just something nice to learn

102
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,730
how to do if you right click on a video

103
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,129
track you can just go to delete track it

104
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,239
says what do you want to do with delete

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,569
video 3 ok video 2 right click delete

106
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,059
track and ok so now we just have one

107
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,589
video track and I'm gonna leave our

108
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,029
second audio track and I'll show you why

109
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,309
in a second here yeah but we can zoom in

110
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,680
and make our tracks are kind of thin now

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,879
we can make them even thinner by

112
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,430
clicking this button here or this one

113
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,949
smaller tracks makes them small so you

114
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,228
can have a dozen different video tracks

115
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,199
and audio tracks and have a very complex

116
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,728
edit that you're doing or if it's a

117
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,500
simple one like this we can just click

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,849
and scale it up and make it a little bit

119
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,530
larger to see

120
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,570
so you see we see we have our audio

121
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,720
waveform down here for our music and

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,190
then there's also a little bit of audio

123
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,600
you see these kind of almost looks like

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,760
a little mountain ridges that we're

125
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,230
seeing the audio waveform of the video

126
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,440
as well if we want a mute we can click

127
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,660
this speaker button and it'll mute just

128
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,760
that track so audio one track is now

129
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,480
muted now if we go ahead and play this

130
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,760
we just hear the rain if I click unmute

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,430
that's music to start playing and we can

132
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,160
go back and use just the RAM so it's

133
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,370
just music playing both of them and have

134
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,770
just the video playing so that's that's

135
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,690
how you can control muting this lock

136
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,430
button makes it so when it's locked

137
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,890
we can't edit or make any changes to it

138
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,169
whereas this one we can still move

139
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,669
around the audio we can move it down to

140
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,790
audio to if we want but this lock button

141
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,110
makes this track the watch so that's

142
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,120
what those buttons do well I'm going to

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,980
umm you both of these now and I'm going

144
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,419
to show you how to separate out the

145
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,760
audio so we could just mute it and then

146
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,500
we could render our video and be fine

147
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,169
but sometimes you might want to separate

148
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:32,910
the audio from your video and use just

149
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,340
the audio file somewhere or you might

150
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,870
want to move it forward since this is a

151
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,450
rain sound it does not really doesn't

152
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,370
matter if it's tied to a specific event

153
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,900
of this video because it's just a

154
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,270
constant pattern the whole time so we

155
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,830
might want to move it forward or back a

156
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,020
little bit so let's right-click and go

157
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,800
to split audio and that puts the audio

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,430
down in this audio track below they're

159
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,080
still tied to each other they're still

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,669
it's called grouped they're grouped

161
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,770
together so if we move one the other one

162
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,720
will move along with it that's because

163
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
if you ever have like a person a video

164
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,620
of a person talking or something that

165
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,090
you want a lot of times your audio will

166
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,400
be you'll want it to be in sync with

167
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,530
your video but at this we don't want

168
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,020
that to happen in this case necessarily

169
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,970
so we can right click and go to ungroup

170
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,310
Clips and that'll make it so that we can

171
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,340
control you separately we could do the

172
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,590
same thing if we want this music maybe

173
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,180
we want this to go to the end here and

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,910
we want this music track and this video

175
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,790
track to go together we can we can hold

176
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,710
down the shift key and select both of

177
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,710
them or maybe the control keys edit yeah

178
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,249
hold down the control key we

179
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,299
select them both and move them together

180
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,299
like that and we can hold down the

181
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,499
control key once they're both selected

182
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,539
we can right click and go group clips

183
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,969
then they'll always stay together even

184
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,669
if we don't even if we unclick but I'm

185
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,259
gonna ungroup them so that's how

186
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,579
grouping works I wanted to show you that

187
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,349
real quick Oh

188
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,999
today ungroup um yeah another one group

189
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,109
okay so let's do this let's have the

190
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:05,979
rain sound start with a black screen and

191
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,949
then let's have our video start so it's

192
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,019
gonna go left to right the playhead is

193
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,749
gonna start over here we'll have some

194
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:20,229
rain and the video will start maybe we

195
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,419
want to end the whole thing we want this

196
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,959
music to end with the last frame of the

197
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,439
video clip so to do that we're going to

198
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,869
cut the video like we did in the last

199
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:34,269
the last tutorial we go over here to

200
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,860
this little scissor icon and left-click

201
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,919
it the scripts our razor tool and we are

202
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,259
cursor turns to a little scissors and

203
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,169
wherever we click we can cut I'm just

204
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,759
left clicking a couple times we can cut

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,739
different parts of this and if you want

206
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,849
to move and we have to go back to our

207
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,559
selection tool which is right here and

208
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,319
we can select and grab this piece of

209
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,899
audio around and move it we don't want

210
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,309
in the video track necessarily but we

211
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,619
hit the Delete key and it goes away so

212
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:00,969
we'll select this one left click and

213
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:06,459
delete left click and delete and then we

214
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,879
let's go back to our razor tool or we

215
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,559
gonna hit the X key on our keyboard to

216
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,449
bring up that razor tool and then we go

217
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,799
right to where the playhead is because I

218
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,839
want to cut this right at the right when

219
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,089
our video clip ends I want the audio to

220
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,399
end as well and then to get back to our

221
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,959
selection tool we can click here or we

222
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,909
can press the S key on our keyboard and

223
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,459
left-click it's swept it has the red box

224
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,889
around it hit delete and so now our

225
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,349
video and our music will end at the same

226
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,448
time and then just at the start of the

227
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,149
video it's gonna be all black but maybe

228
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,860
I kind of want that as like an effect

229
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,740
and so I'm not gonna do any more in this

230
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,839
video but in the next video we'll be

231
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
we'll look at actually adding in these

232
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
effects here so you just like left click

233
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,230
and drag and drop an audio effect in and

234
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,660
then it actually adds in that audio

235
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,260
effect

236
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,820
to that part of the file and same with

237
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,680
the video effects so we'll be playing

238
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,750
with a lot of these different things in

239
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,790
the future in future tutorials so check

240
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,770
those out but to render this video out

241
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,390
so I'm gonna delete these effects that I

242
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,500
put in and how I should have done that

243
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,170
yet and to render this project out we'll

244
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,850
just go left click render if we like it

245
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,850
the way it is I always click on mp4 and

246
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,400
then choose a location to render this

247
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,870
file to so I'm gonna do mine on my

248
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,720
desktop I'll just call it test mp4 and

249
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,620
hit save then we just hit render to file

250
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,780
it goes since the short video it's 11

251
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,750
seconds long but little over 11 seconds

252
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,220
it just takes a few seconds to render

253
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,300
and then we have this rendering of this

254
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,400
video and again if you're making an

255
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
actual real project you might want to

256
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,840
check out make you want to make sure you

257
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,900
go into your project and and project

258
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,720
settings and you can configure the type

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
of video you want if you're working in

260
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,550
4k if you're working in 1080p 720p

261
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,100
that's just the size the resolution but

262
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,170
by default I think I'm not sure if it's

263
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,450
defaulter I set it but I always work in

264
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,810
1080p and 30 FPS or 29.97 fps

265
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,710
anyway that's completely rendered out

266
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,940
now so we'll just see our finished

267
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,920

268
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,940

271
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,780
