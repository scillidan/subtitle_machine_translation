1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
in this video we'll be using caden live

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,960
and the mask effect to create this

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
surreal image of an ocean inside of a

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,760
mug

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
so we'll drag to our video track one

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
this image of a coffee mug and then also

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
this video of the ocean on the on the

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
upper track we'll adjust the coffee mug

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
to be the same length as our video

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
and then go to effects and search for

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,279
mask we want this alpha shapes mask

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,480
and we'll change the shape to ellipse

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
and then we can move this around and

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,399
it'll just show only that part of the

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,760
video

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
within this ellipse we'll change this

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
transition width which is really

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,239
feathering

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
it can also be called

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,760
just for those edges and then we'll make

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,680
it the size of this and this this one

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
works pretty easy because it's just a

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
nice simple shape there's more advanced

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
masking we can do

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
and then we play the video it will just

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
show this video of the ocean only over

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,160
this part of the image it's actually

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,280
really cool

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,879
if you want to follow along you can find

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
these images and video in the

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,479
description of this video you can

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,760
download and kind of do these same

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
things

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
but that's it caden live is free in open

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,799
source software and i have tutorials

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,400
teaching how to use it from a very basic

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,360
level

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,560
thanks for watching look forward to

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,439
catching you in the next video
