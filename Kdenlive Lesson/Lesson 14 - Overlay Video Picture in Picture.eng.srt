00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,460
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,930
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,929
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,849
creating a picture-in-picture effect

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,369
where we'll have a main video playing

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,529
and then we'll overlay another smaller

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,619
video overtop of that so you can follow

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,179
along I'm just going to download from

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,240
pixabay.com I'm gonna change my search

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,589
to video and I'll just search jungle and

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,699
there's a few videos I'm just going to

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,189
download to use this first ones a video

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,220
of a parent and so I'll just click free

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,650
download and we'll download up to the

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,780
720 so it downloads faster and renders

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,550
faster so I'm down only this 1280 by 720

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,550
it is Creative Commons 0 it's by SEF

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,450
alone are so appreciate this oh it has

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,050
audio too cool and I'm gonna go back so

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,580
we appreciate Cephalonia for uploading

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,050
this and then I'm gonna download this

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,290
one here that's a like a beach seascape

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,379
buy cover free footage and it's also

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,510
Creative Commons 0 so we'll go ahead and

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,520
click free download down over the 720

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,270
version and and we have these two video

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,520
files so I'm gonna pause this will

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,680
minimize and I'm bring this in the

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,510
kdenlive I'm gonna do it this time by

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,900
just going to my downloads folder

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,860
finding those files that were downloaded

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,630
like the parrot I'll left click and drag

33
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,880
it into the project bin and then I'll

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,260
grab the other one which is this

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,500
seascape perfect

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,750
now what I want to do I'll just I want

37
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,330
the seascape to be my that whichever you

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,700
want to have your main large footage you

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,830
want to put that on video track 1 so I'm

40
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,420
gonna left click this seascape and bring

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,100
it down to video track 1 start it all

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,190
the way at 0 and I'm gonna come down

43
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,479
here and resize a little bit so I can

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,270
see my timeline better and then I'm

45
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,860
gonna grab this video of the parrot and

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,630
put it on a video track 2 then we can

47
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,979
see this video if the parrot is quite a

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,409
bit longer it's if we look up at the top

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,500
there it's about almost 45 seconds

50
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,020
whereas this seascape is only about 14

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,829
seconds so I want to just resize this in

52
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,779
the past we've done the razor tool we

53
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,160
can click the razor and just go

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,070
the very end then left click and cut and

55
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,320
go to select tool click and delete

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,270
another way we can do that if I hit

57
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,670
control Z and undo that cut we can just

58
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,340
go to the end of this video and we can

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,320
just hover until we get to this little

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,390
arrow resize and I can resize this

61
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,640
parrot clip all the way down and that's

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,740
just gonna clip it from the end it's

63
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,470
gonna clip wherever wherever this ends

64
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,020
at so come right down to there and then

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,020
it'll snap to end right at about 14 just

66
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,330
a little over 14 seconds so my whole

67
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,850
project is the same length so now if I

68
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,060
play it's going to play just the parent

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,480
and we'll probably hear the audio oh the

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
audio is on the parrot clip maybe

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,620
there's no audio I thought for sure I

72
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,300
heard some audio somewhere else I don't

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,310
see any audio on this so neither clip

74
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,600
has audio which is fine but we see we're

75
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,460
not seeing this if we were to switch if

76
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,990
these were to switch places and we put

77
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,210
the parrot down here and then this

78
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,360
whatever video is on the higher video

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,580
track the higher number video track gets

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,770
displayed first so now if we play and we

81
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,760
see the beach seascape video but since

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,410
we want the parrot to be on top we do

83
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,330
this and then we just want to apply a

84
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,310
transform like we've done in the past

85
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,430
tutorials so we come over here to crop

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,040
and transform we drag transform we put

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,470
it on top of the parrot clip and it

88
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,150
brings up these options we can then

89
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,250
transform and change this and it puts

90
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,680
this box around at this red box so we

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,000
can actually just click these corners

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,760
and drag it down and now we've got this

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,709
little parrot down in the bottom right

94
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,120
hand corner so now if we play it'll play

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,530
both of them at once so play the parrot

96
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,450
clip and it'll show kind of the beach

97
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,030
and we can actually move this too maybe

98
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,470
it'd be better to have in the top right

99
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,160
corner so we can see what's going on so

100
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,630
that's how you do video in video and

101
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,160
then we can also add in if we wanted to

102
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,910
we can add in just a picture if I go

103
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,550
what's a good picture I have I have a

104
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,890
picture here of a guy falling this is

105
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,510
just a what's open it up here so I can

106
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,200
show you it's just a picture like a JPEG

107
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,910
is just a JPEG image of like a person

108
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,669
kind of falling and so it's not a video

109
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,050
of clip at all

110
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,669
but we can also just drag in this video

111
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,620
clip so we can put it on video 3 I'm

112
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,479
sorry not video clip this picture and

113
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,759
now it'll just play this picture for

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,830
like 5 seconds if we double click we can

115
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,159
change the duration or we can go to the

116
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,780
end like we did with the video and just

117
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,810
scroll or drag and keep it so now this

118
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,970
is the same length and now we see it's

119
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,800
kind of overlaid on top too we can see

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,349
the video on the side we can drag and

121
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:54,120
drop a transform on top of this as well

122
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,669
and then we can transform it oops why is

123
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,729
it going over there oh ok so it's

124
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,069
drawing it a box around the whole thing

125
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,169
is as a transparent transparent on both

126
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,960
sides but we can still just resize this

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,810
and confuse me for a second there so if

128
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,120
we want this and if we wanted it to in

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
fact what we could do is only have its

130
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,300
display for it for a moment so by that I

131
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,550
what I mean is let's say we're playing

132
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,830
we have our video clip of our parrot

133
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,780
going here and then when it gets to that

134
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,370
point of the video it displays this

135
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,340
picture and then it goes away so and

136
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,870
then we can move that to any point in

137
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,659
the in the video clip and we could also

138
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,039
do that same thing with the with a

139
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,860
parrot if we scale this down a little

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,099
bit more or not if we shorten it then

141
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,599
we'll see it'll play we'll have the

142
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,509
picture come on for a short while then

143
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,060
as soon as the picture goes off we can

144
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,370
have the parrot go away as well and yeah

145
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,430
it creates that that's a new video in

146
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,409
video or picture in picture effect we

147
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,610
could also have the picture be the

148
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,349
static background if we wanted to and

149
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,449
then resize the beach footage to make it

150
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,190
smaller so I think you're getting the

151
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,099
idea of how that works if you have any

152
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,870
questions comments please leave them

153
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,240
below go ahead and like and subscribe if

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
