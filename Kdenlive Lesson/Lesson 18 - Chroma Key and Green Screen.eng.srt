00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,070
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,509
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,329
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:12,209
using kitten live to do the green-screen

5
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:14,699
chroma key effect so we'll take a blue

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,830
background or a green background screen

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,800
and make it transparent and overlay it

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,919
over top of another video so first of

9
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,119
all we need to get some green screen

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,710
footage so if you want to follow along

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,449
or maybe you already have your own but

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,769
if you don't you can go to pixabay.com

13
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,810
we can get some free green screen

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,210
footage just search under videos and

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,110
search a green screen and then we'll

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,760
find the nice thing so we'll get this

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,970
like that this butterfly how about yeah

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,280
this is to butterfly so so nice short

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,360
video perfect for us this is by Z vector

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,210
so appreciate that user sharing this

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,650
with us creative commons 0 free for

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,840
personal and commercial use so we'll

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,700
download this 1920 by 1080 and yeah well

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,830
you said is our file so first of all and

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,240
I have another file that we've used in

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,069
the past so I'm gonna go to my downloads

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,560
folder actually let's just do well do is

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,610
this beach one that we've been using

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,800
it's kind of fun you know drag in this

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,040
green screen of the butterfly so we take

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,200
our beach scene first whatever we want

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,430
to have be our our background video or

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,380
image and then our green screen we want

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,600
to do on top of it and so I'm going to

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,920
zoom in here on the timeline so I can

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,270
see look the better what's going on I'm

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,500
going to come to the end of this beach

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,470
scene and resize it down to the length

39
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,290
of this video clip of the butterfly

40
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,060
perfect so now and then I'll zoom in

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,380
even more on the timeline so we can

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,790
really get a good idea for what's

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,900
happening here perfect so now if we play

44
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,299
this it just shows the butterfly against

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,940
a green screen but underneath it's

46
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
playing the video of the beach of the

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,990
coastline we just can't see it because

48
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,350
the green screen is you know filling up

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,119
the whole screen so we need to make that

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,780
green go away to do that we use the

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,090
chroma key so we can just start typing

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,760
in might even be under color huh yeah

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,449
chroma hold but come up here just type

54
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,840
in

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,640
chromakey it's always under alpha

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,170
manipulation so we want to find

57
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,840
chromakey and we'll just drag chromakey

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,660
over top of the video that has the green

59
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,239
screen in it and it comes up with some

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,220
options over here under properties so

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,480
right now it's saying what is the color

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,360
key it's saying it's blue right now we

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,700
can try and like set it to green but

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,870
it's not really gonna work we need to

65
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,300
choose the exact color so to do that we

66
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,340
use this color picker and we click pick

67
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,260
a color and then click on the color we

68
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,510
want and instantly it goes to full green

69
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,989
now this screen was if we turn this off

70
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,760
look at this it's not really a screen

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,220
this is a 3d rendered so it's already a

72
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,709
perfect green color if you have a real

73
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,150
green screen you're gonna have some

74
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,160
you're gonna have trouble keying it

75
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,010
correctly possibly and so you can change

76
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,840
this variance I'll turn this back on you

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,730
get this variance here the in change and

78
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,799
see so now parts of the butterfly or

79
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,110
evinced going transparent so you can

80
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,390
change this variance here to see you

81
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,450
know to get yours to work properly but

82
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,859
ours worked really good because it's a

83
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,739
3d rendered green screen all right now

84
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,450
so if we play this we'll see it'll play

85
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,430
the video of the background and it's

86
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,459
butterflies like we flying around but

87
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,380
it's huge maybe we want to change it so

88
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,440
just remember we can change if we go to

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
our effects and then we get rid of this

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,140
under crop and transform we can just

91
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,540
apply a transform to this in addition to

92
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,709
the green screen we can apply a

93
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,620
transform and we can just transform it

94
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,840
go to the middle so we can kind of see

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,980
and then we can just transform it down -

96
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,000
yeah about here so we can have this

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,180
butterfly just flying along maybe we'll

98
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,340
put it over here if we click play it'll

99
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,290
just stay that size the whole time and

100
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,319
kind of fly ahead doing its thing

101
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,329
yeah that's how I want to do look we can

102
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,359
change the rotation of it to go back to

103
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,859
the middle so we can actually change the

104
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,750
rotation of the butterfly too so that it

105
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,590
looks like it's flying more with the

106
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,789
angle of the camera a little bit maybe

107
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,459
anyway so that is it that is as simple

108
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,070
as it is using green screen

109
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,690
and again you'll learn you know if

110
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,830
you're just getting into green screen

111
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,050
the setup of your green screen if you're

112
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,090
filming your own getting your lighting

113
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,560
perfect is going to make your life a lot

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,230
easier than trying to key it and change

115
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,010
it around in the software yeah hope you

116
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,210
found this video informative that's how

117
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,830
you'd green screen if you had a blue

118
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,840
screen you could change you want to

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,310
change it manually the color like this

120
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,110
you always want to click on this dot and

121
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,940
then left click and select your screen

122
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,320
yeah thanks for watching join me in the

123
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,370
next video we'll see you then
