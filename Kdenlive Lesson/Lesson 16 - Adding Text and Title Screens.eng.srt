00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,610
welcome back to another kdenlive video

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,980
editing tutorial in this video we're

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,490
going to learn how to apply text on

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,860
overtop of a video and how to create a

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,560
title introduction screen to your video

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,810
project so to get started I'm just gonna

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,990
drag in some video that I already have

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,789
we'll do this we'll do one of these ones

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,669
which one should we do how about this

10
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,169
one of the parrot this is one we looked

11
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,630
at recently so we have this parrot here

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,830
we can drag it down into our video one

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,750
track on our timeline and then I'm just

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,580
going to play and we can see what this

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,290
video looks like so let's say maybe

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,660
before this video starts we want to have

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,660
a title introduction screen well to do

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,030
that we come up here and instead of

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,800
clicking add clip so we'd likely we

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,060
would go to search a place on our

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,560
computer to add video or audio or

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,900
picture we just go to this little drop

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,420
down here and we go to add title clip

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,270
and that'll bring up this dialogue here

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,510
we have this back this yeah this this

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,580
view of these checker boxes this is a

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,550
transparent background and we can come

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,140
up here to these text tools we can click

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,870
add text and we can click and then it

30
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,520
creates something that says text on here

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,070
and oops I think we can just start that

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,840
way to double click it so we double

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,250
click it and then we can go in and

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,440
actually edit this text so I'm gonna

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,710
call mine

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,520
welcome to TJ free and then we come up

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,560
here we have our selection tool up here

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,810
so we can click off the text click on a

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,520
selection tool and then we can click and

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,140
drag it around and move it we have

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,330
options for controlling it over here so

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,909
we can change the font size if we select

43
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,100
all this we can actually change the font

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,610
size and make it larger we can change

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,729
the font style so we can find a cool you

46
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,229
know font that we like to use with like

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,049
Comic Sans and then we can change the

48
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,510
color so we didn't make it red if we

49
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,670
want to just keep in mind it's going to

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,350
be on a black background so it looks

51
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,389
like it's on these white squares now but

52
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,859
if we click down here at the bottom this

53
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:13,049
option that says show background it'll

54
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,920
show

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,090
well it's gonna be right now it's

56
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,350
showing the background over topic would

57
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,270
it look like with the parent but if we

58
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,590
were to put it before they would just be

59
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,209
black so before the video the parrot

60
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,140
starts to be black

61
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,350
so but this is fine for adding it to

62
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,320
here and the outline of it is black we

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
can change the outline as well to a

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,890
different color maybe make it green so

65
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,650
it's the outline around the text oh and

66
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,540
it actually we have to to make it up

67
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,650
apply right now it's on this completely

68
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,510
numb is completely transparent so we

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,540
have to bring this all the way up to

70
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,330
full full non-transparency I guess you

71
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,160
can go it and so now the outline of our

72
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,010
text is green yeah and then it'll just

73
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,350
stay there wherever we put it and if we

74
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,820
want to there's some tools we can Center

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,170
it if we click this button that centers

76
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,930
it with the video along the vertical

77
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,700
axis and we can click this one to Center

78
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,220
it along the horizontal access axis we

79
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,140
can click this button to have it be all

80
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,940
the way over to the left hand side or

81
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,920
all the way to the right hand side so

82
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,450
some different options there but

83
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,350
emotionally this right in the center

84
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,730
yeah so let's click OK and let's just

85
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,620
see what it looks like now so it's not

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,209
on our video yet because what it does it

87
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,549
creates an actual title clip up here as

88
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,700
if it was a video or audio file so we

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,040
have to drag and bring it into one of

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,470
our video tracks so if we put on video

91
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,690
too if we put it right in the middle of

92
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,350
video too

93
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,000
what'll happen is when we start playing

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,280
the video it'll wait till it gets to

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,739
that point and then it will overlay it

96
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,450
as soon as it gets to that point of the

97
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,470
video this does have audio I thought in

98
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,269
the last video I thought it didn't have

99
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,709
any audio but it turns out it does and

100
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,260
so okay we're gonna go back over here

101
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,620
and now if we move it to the beginning

102
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,970
of the video clip we'll see it'll play

103
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,950
at the beginning but then it only played

104
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,450
for a short amount of time and then that

105
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,750
clip will disappear so by default the

106
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,970
video clip is 5 seconds long if we

107
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,100
double click we can see the duration 5

108
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,320
seconds so we can change this if we want

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,239
to be longer if we want to be 15 seconds

110
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,019
we can just type in here 1 5 hit OK

111
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,630
and it makes it 15 seconds long we can

112
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,270
also go to the end of the title clip if

113
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,400
we hover over we get this cursor our

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,170
cursor changes to these

115
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,690
horizontal arrows we can left-click and

116
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,270
drag and make it the same length as our

117
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,190
video if we want to have this text be

118
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,180
over the video the whole time and we can

119
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,710
drag from the beginning too so we can

120
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,860
resize the clip that way and if we want

121
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,030
to be if we want this to be an

122
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,100
introduction and not have it be with a

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,840
parent we can just move the parrot video

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,100
forward to about here if we move it

125
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,080
completely forward then we'll see the

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,650
title of the video it'll just play like

127
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,720
this and then it'll go directly from the

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,540
title screen to the video clip of the

129
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,260
parent and if we want to have a little

130
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,640
overlap there we can do something like

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,270
this

132
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,580
so we can drag it and so we can actually

133
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,530
have this video overlap a little bit

134
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,740
with this parent video so now it'll play

135
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,950
and then it'll show the video of the

136
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,690
parrot and keep the text on the screen

137
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,870
and then the text will go away all right

138
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,070
something cool we can do since this is

139
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,480
black I'll just show you since we've

140
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,280
been doing effects in the past there is

141
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,330
a cool effect

142
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,940
that's called fade from black so if we

143
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,370
drag on fade from black it'll fade in

144
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,440
this video from a black background and

145
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,020
since our title clip is already having a

146
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,540
black background like this it'll create

147
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,030
this cool effect and it'll kind of the

148
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,440
text will disappear and then it'll fade

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,630
in so let's play this and see how it

150
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,170
looks so it's just playing the text

151
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,990
right now and then we'll see a fade so

152
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,210
the parrot fades in as they're just just

153
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,550
just being instantly there and we can

154
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,010
adjust the duration of this fade too by

155
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,860
using the scroll bar here and there's

156
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,420
also a fade out if we want to apply a

157
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,730
fade out to black we see a crease this

158
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,620
little red triangle and we can fade out

159
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,380
to black as well so at the end of the

160
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,760
video clip it'll just fade into

161
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,630
blackness

162
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,840
that is using the text tool to to create

163
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,719
a title clip to create text overtop of

164
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,779
video or an introduction title before

165
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,060
the video starts pre-show you watch this

166
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,439
video hopefully you found it informative

167
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,449
join me on the next one see you then
