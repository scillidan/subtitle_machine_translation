00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,370
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,160
tutorial using kdenlive in this video

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,200
we're going to be learning about the

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,730
transitions and playing with some

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,619
different transitions so in the last

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,809
video we made this picture slideshow we

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,130
have these different pictures that it's

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,380
going through we added some audio but

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,490
I'm going to delete the audio track

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,080
right now so I select it hit the Delete

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,750
key or not the audio track I'll delete

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,429
the audio clip that was within the audio

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,929
track so let's look at these transitions

14
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,000
so if you're on effects you can toggle

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,380
between the tab at the bottom to get

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,050
between effects and transitions but

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,490
we'll go to the transitions and let's

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,610
just go to like a simple one let's do

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,170
like slide so if we drag this slide over

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,510
here we can put it over top of any clip

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,610
we want and just appears as I eat a

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,590
little yellow of box here and to get a

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,240
better view I'm gonna right click I'm

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,150
I'm gonna delete this video track here

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm going to delete this audio track

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,150
here and then I'm just going to click

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,650
this button here to kind of zoom in so

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,210
we see of this a little bit larger so

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,670
it's easier to see okay and then I'm

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,440
also going to toggle this so that we can

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,240
see so it fills the whole timeline

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,130
alright so we have three pictures three

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,860
clips and we applied a slide to this

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,300
clip so let's see what happens what that

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,170
looks like if we hit play so that

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,180
picture this slides in we can drag and

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,010
slowly look at that and see how it looks

38
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,409
so that's what that slide is doing its

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,030
animating this picture and sliding it in

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,460
alright if we maybe you're thinking okay

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,320
well we want it let's we like that but

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,610
look what happens this picture

43
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,930
disappears completely

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,930
and then this slides in from black and

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,490
maybe you've seen or you've used other

46
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,320
editing software where this will

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,990
actually slide out and then this will

48
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,310
kind of slide so the other picture will

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,049
be here in the black the black sliding

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,810
so I'll show you how to do that and it

51
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,100
involves using these different video

52
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,409
tracks so I'm gonna delete this slide

53
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,939
and we're actually going to move this

54
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,579
video up to over here and we want to

55
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,680
overlap these clips

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,290
about the same length you know I'm gonna

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,900
do I'm actually gonna we're gonna use

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,250
the third track so I'm gonna go to leave

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,650
this audio track and I'm gonna add in

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,220
right-click and go to add insert drag

61
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,470
and let's insert track above video two

62
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,480
and it's call it video three so we're

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
just bringing video three back basically

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,709
because I'm gonna want to layer this all

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,810
three of these so we've learned in past

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,909
tutorials whatever is on the upper most

67
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,730
of the higher number video track is

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,500
going to be what's displayed first and

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,930
the bottom one will be last so as soon

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,060
as we get to this point we have this

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,829
picture being displayed but as soon as

72
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,739
we see these two being overlapped it'll

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,650
display the one over top and we see

74
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,329
these we can actually see through

75
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,739
because this pictures not quite large

76
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,549
enough so we kind of see through there

77
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,780
and again we have a look at the

78
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,489
properties up here we have an effect

79
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,609
already for doing an edge crop to

80
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,930
achieve the look of this picture okay so

81
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,519
let's do this so let's instead of slide

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,560
let's grab the wipe because white

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,609
actually has a lot more different

84
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,609
options so wipe is basically if you're

85
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:21,569
looking you're probably looking through

86
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,680
a lot of these transitions you're like

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,690
huh none of these I want to do like

88
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,239
swirl and I want to do like this but

89
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,940
this has dissolve but basically a lot of

90
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,079
the transitions you're looking for we're

91
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,720
going to be in the white transition so

92
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
we're gonna drag it down and put it on

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,970
top of this clip and then we see it'll

94
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,519
do it - as it'll size itself to be the

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,739
same length as however much the video is

96
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,180
overlapped and so now by default the if

97
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,250
we click on transitions click on this

98
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,319
transition and see what it is it's going

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,040
to do the wipe method is gonna be linear

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,239
maybe from left to right let's see what

101
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,530
it looks like cool so that did what we

102
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,220
wanted it to do

103
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,430
right it was very quick - so it just

104
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,489
takes this picture and it wipes the over

105
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,199
the picture above it over top of it so

106
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,370
we see that's kind of like the slide

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,959
actually I think we can even do a slide

108
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,639
with this one let me see if we can't but

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,200
we got like this o'clock we can change

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,550
that to this o'clock one and that'll

111
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,030
look like this

112
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,340
we can change so to change the method

113
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,260
and instead of applying a different

114
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,810
transition we just it's all under this

115
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,250
wipe transition and we can do like these

116
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,430
horizontal lines that people like to do

117
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,050
do so I actually don't do a lot of these

118
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,000
anyway you might think they look cool

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,910
and maybe they do this is kind of cool

120
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,830
but transitions you gotta be super

121
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,300
careful with them because they can just

122
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,130
look make you look really like an

123
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,560
amateur and just like I don't know you

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,330
gotta be careful I don't I don't do

125
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,210
transitions a whole lot but depending on

126
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,220
what you're doing so this is how you

127
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,600
would apply a different transition if

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,880
you want to do let's let's try this

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,620
slide again let's do this slide between

130
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,260
these two ellipses so I'm gonna apply it

131
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,440
to the top video and then again you have

132
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,940
to have it overlaid first because if we

133
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,980
if it wasn't overlaid and we just come

134
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,670
drag it in it'll just it just make it a

135
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,860
very long so look how long this is right

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,840
now so this is gonna as soon as this

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,810
video is done it'll come here and you'll

138
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,820
like nothing's really happening it's

139
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,490
just not working right but so to get it

140
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,750
to work properly we hit the Delete key

141
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,990
we want our video to already be

142
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,550
overlapping a little bit and then we

143
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,830
drag the slide in and then it knows ok

144
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,720
cool we're gonna slide and we're gonna

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,340
create a slide transition between this

146
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,070
top video or this top picture in this

147
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,500
bottom picture and you can't actually do

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,230
transitions between video as well these

149
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,760
happen to be pictures we're doing but

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,680
they could be video and so now it's

151
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,380
gonna slide over top of there and then

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,100
we see it like that and then and then

153
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,480
the different options for slide we have

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,250
is where it's sliding so this is saying

155
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,560
start fighting from the left and then

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,750
end in the middle but we could start

157
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,030
sliding from the top and then end in the

158
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,250
middle so then it looks like this slides

159
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,500
over top we could start from the bottom

160
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
and end in the middle and if we want to

161
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,400
do a slide out we would we put it we

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,350
drag the slide to this clip here so it's

163
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,090
on the bottom clip now and then we'd

164
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,680
start so now it's kind of messed up

165
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,980
because we're we start and then slide

166
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,320
well it's just not working but we would

167
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,650
start from the we drag this down

168
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,840
first of all and then we see what it's

169
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,930
looking like but that's just weird you

170
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,039
see what's happening it's like a it's

171
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,850
showing the whole picture because

172
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,979
because we're telling this slide start

173
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,919
in the middle or start at the bottom and

174
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,930
then end in the middle so it's starting

175
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,699
this picture from the bottom and then

176
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,520
it's ending it in the middle but then as

177
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,380
soon as it's done ending it jumps back

178
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,180
to this picture so we actually want to

179
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,910
start in the middle and then end like to

180
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,220
the right or something so this way it'll

181
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,320
transition out it'll slide by sliding

182
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,010
out and away onto this so it's kind of a

183
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,870
different way to think about it but it

184
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,370
gives you a lot more flexibility doing

185
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,570
it this way and there's actually

186
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,850
transparency too if we wanted to we can

187
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,360
have it start a little bit transparent

188
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,880
like that and then and then it'll

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,620
actually fade the transparency as well

190
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,750
so that kind of creates a weird looking

191
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,070
effect but that's just an option you can

192
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,680
have too so I think those are the only

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,210
two I'm gonna show you today we got we

194
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,639
just did slide and wipe it but just know

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,979
there's some other ones too and and a

196
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,030
lot of these ones yeah we'll play with

197
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,080
some of these ones in the future I

198
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,370
actually don't yet I don't even know

199
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,479
what a lot of these ones do so I got to

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,880
learn them myself but probably most of

201
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,900
transitions you're going to want to do

202
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,099
are going to be under this wipe

203
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,990
transition and you've got some different

204
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,419
options for you know cool things that

205
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,820
you can create out of that so I hope

206
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,500
