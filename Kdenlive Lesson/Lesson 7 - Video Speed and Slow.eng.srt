00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,070
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,480
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
kdenlive

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,749
in this video I'm going to show you how

5
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:13,320
to apply the speed effect under motion

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,809
so we can change and make a video faster

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,380
or slower than it normally is so I'm

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,449
going to start by bringing in a clip

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,580
I'll click here here on add clip and

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,699
we'll just bring in this clip of this

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,490
cyclist that we downloaded from pixabay

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,259
we can the clip appears over here in our

13
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,240
project bin we can click play clip and

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,150
see what this looks like at normal speed

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,320
let's go ahead and speed this up

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,820
actually we'll speed up and slow down to

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
a couple things to it so I'm gonna pause

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,530
it we can just drag right here on this

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,450
clip monitor if we click right here

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,280
anywhere in the video we can drag it

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,410
down to our timeline

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,690
it didn't go quite go and then we can

23
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,880
also we could have also click and drag

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,820
it from here to what we can't do is drag

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,570
it from a file in our computer we can't

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,250
drag it there unless it's in our clip

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,349
monitor already so we can drag into our

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,480
clip our clip project bin but we can't

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,360
drag it into I don't we can drag it into

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,700
the clip monitor or not now we can't

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,960
drag it anywhere the only place we can

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,790
drive from our computer is into the

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,860
project bin and then from project bin we

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,710
can drag into our timeline anyway so now

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,180
we have it we have two copies of the

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,310
same video down here we only want one so

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,420
I'm gonna delete the second one by

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,590
hitting the Delete key on my keyboard

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,780
then I'll select this one we know what

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,430
selected cuz as the red box around it

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,290
and I'm going to come down here to the

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,550
bottom right and just make this a little

43
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,300
bit larger alright I mean make my

44
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,550
timeline view larger the video is

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,740
staying the same size we see it's still

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,860
the same speed that it's always been but

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,840
we are in our project monitor so we're

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,430
watching it down here we know that -

49
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,580
because our playhead is moving along

50
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,299
with the video

51
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,040
whereas if we're gonna clip monitor and

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,130
we hit play it'll play this clip and our

53
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,740
playhead down here staying still even

54
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,450
though our video is playing up here

55
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,369
that's the way you can tell which

56
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,359
monitor you're on and yeah so now we're

57
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,400
going to take and apply the effect to

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,599
this clip to do that we go to motion

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,969
left click on the speed effect and drag

60
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,760
it over top of the clip now it says

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,590
speed in the top left corner of the clip

62
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,689
and also we have some new properties

63
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,060
that weren't here before there's just

64
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,579
one control for speed and that is it's

65
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,709
in percentage so the percentage right

66
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,019
now is 100% that means it's just playing

67
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,139
normal speed if we want to go twice as

68
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,269
fast we can change this we can click and

69
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,959
change it to 200% and hit enter and that

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,969
automatically shortens down the length

71
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,340
of our clip because now it's playing

72
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,250
twice as fast so it's going to take half

73
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,120
the time to play does that make sense so

74
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,590
we can come back and play this and see

75
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,010
what it looks like fast pretty cool

76
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,680
maybe we want it to be slow so we can

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,879
change it we can also just click and

78
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,469
drag up in here but it's little bit

79
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,060
sensitive on my computer I think it

80
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,489
depends on what operating system you're

81
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,409
using we can change it we can see it

82
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,150
just changes the size dynamically down

83
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,689
there let's change it down to about 58%

84
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,540
so this will be almost half speed so now

85
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,310
if we play everything should be really

86
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,970
slow so that's about half the normal

87
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,750
speed it would it would normally be

88
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,970
maybe what I want to have happen to get

89
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,590
rid of all the effects out of this we

90
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,000
just delete it or we can click on these

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,759
three lines and go reset effect and that

92
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,530
resets it back to what everything what

93
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,189
normally was which is 100% so we're back

94
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,209
to normal speed let's do this let's I'm

95
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,009
just left clicking on the playhead right

96
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,810
now and I'm kind of scrubbing along to

97
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,849
us find a certain point how about as

98
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,000
soon as he touches the bike let's have

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,239
it go into slow motion right here so to

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,709
do that if I want to have different

101
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,239
portions of this video will be different

102
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,459
speeds I need to cut the clip otherwise

103
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,530
it applies the effect to the entire clip

104
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,299
and in fact before I do this I'm just

105
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,889
going to delete the effect so now

106
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,229
there's no effect at all applied to this

107
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,319
clip and I'll go to my razor tool which

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,849
is this good as this little scissor

109
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,579
cursor and I'll click right here and now

110
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,320
I've cut this clip so we'll go back to

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,300
my selection tool now I have this clip

112
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,729
here and then this clip here so I will

113
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,010
apply a speed to this first clip

114
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,610
and the speed we want is gonna be 200%

115
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,390
so I'll change this to 200 hit enter it

116
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,820
shrinks that clip down by half because

117
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,380
it's taking up less space now it's

118
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,510
playing twice as fast so I want to

119
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,250
left-click and drag this over so they

120
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,440
play seamlessly so now it's gonna play

121
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,920
really fast and then it's going to

122
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,530
slowly go back to normal speed so here

123
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,450
it's like running to his bike and then

124
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,790
it slows down then maybe right here

125
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,010
where he jumps on the bike I mean go

126
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,450
back a little bit there by left clicking

127
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,410
and holding to about here I'm gonna go

128
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,970
back to my razor tool and I'm gonna cut

129
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,010
the video here because I want this last

130
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,980
part of the video to be another speed so

131
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,110
this one I want to be has come forward a

132
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,880
little bit till it gets on the bike and

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,260
then we'll clip it right here I'm gonna

134
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,120
go back to my selection tool so now I

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,100
have my ending part of the video which I

136
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,660
can just drag it over here and watch and

137
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,280
see what it's playing like this is just

138
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,050
him riding off at normal speed that's

139
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,270
how I want the ending to be but this

140
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,460
middle part I want to be slower so when

141
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,440
I slow it down it's gonna push out the

142
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,690
video make it longer so just so I don't

143
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,230
get into any trouble with it like over

144
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,760
trying to push into this existing video

145
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,940
I'm gonna move this one up to the video

146
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,780
layer to our video track 2 and now I

147
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,550
should be able to take this clip and I

148
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,380
want this to be slow so it's a hundred

149
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,620
percent now and I want it to be OH so

150
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,660
since there was actually an effect

151
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,850
applied to this it keeps them on all of

152
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,680
these we noticed our first one is two

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,540
hundred percent and then when we split

154
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,730
we just have a bunch of effects at one

155
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,190
hundred percent so I have to reapply it

156
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,810
but if I did if there was no effect on

157
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,350
it I have to read drag it down so let's

158
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,180
do that so I'll make sure the effect is

159
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,100
on and I'll change this down to 50

160
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,560
percent on this clip so sure enough it

161
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,630
pushed it out there it wasn't so far

162
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,100
that it ran into this so I'll drag this

163
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,710
back down and I use these tracks a lot

164
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,180
of time you can even like temporarily

165
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,100
just drag it down to the audio track if

166
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,480
ever you want to just get something out

167
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,250
of the way or you're not sure where

168
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,200
you're gonna add it in it's fine just to

169
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
have just different parts of Clips

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,620
hanging out as long as you remember what

171
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,720
they are that's not a problem I actually

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,139
use the timeline when I'm

173
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,659
editing to just kind of store stuff and

174
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,159
if I don't end up using it I'll just

175
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,080
delete it sometimes or I'll drag it into

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,990
place right last minute but that's a

177
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,370
good way to use the timeline these other

178
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,780
tracks even if you're not gonna render

179
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,639
on those tracks it's a good place to

180
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,960
just kind of set stuff while you're

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,479
waiting anyway so now everything's here

182
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,400
in the same one track so I'm gonna go

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,599
back to the beginning and we'll play

184
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,300
this and we'll see what it looks like so

185
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,180
he ran quickly to get it he slowly gets

186
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,770
on then it goes back to normal speed and

187
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,189
rides off very cool so to accomplish

188
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,080
this multiple speed we have this one at

189
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,440
double speed 200% this one's at 100% the

190
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,469
next one's at 50% so half speed and the

191
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,240
last ones 100% again I'm gonna change

192
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360
this into 200% so he rides off quickly

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,949
and there we have it and then to render

194
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,840
this out this is the only effect we're

195
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,949
gonna we're gonna keep on this whole

196
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,229
thing to render it out I'll just click

197
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,740
render I'll click select mp4 I'll click

198
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,599
this button here to choose a place to

199
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,150
render it to so it'll be desktop and

200
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,449
we'll call it speed bike so what I'm

201
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,449
gonna call mine hit save and then I'll

202
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,699
hit this render to file so it'll render

203
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,710
it was it'll create this video and save

204
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,050
it on my desktop now and it takes a

205
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,279
little bit of time has to go through and

206
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,319
process and it's like okay what are we

207
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,699
doing we're slowing down this part of

208
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,110
the video we're speeding up this part of

209
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,879
the video but it'll apply all those

210
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,129
effects so just remember sometimes it

211
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,050
might be really laggy up here when

212
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,490
you're watching in your project monitor

213
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,560
but when you render it out it gets rid

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
of all that wagging as' and smoothness

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,940
and makes it a nice crispy video so

216
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,610
we'll play this video here and this is

217
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,900
what it looks like so we've kind of got

218
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,610
this slow and you've quickly rides off

219
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,610
so that is using the speed tool the

220
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,830
speed effect in kdenlive to either speed

221
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,360
up or slow down a video there was one

222
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,710
more thing I was gonna say about this oh

223
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,169
yes so this video it happened to not

224
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,990
have any audio associated with it but if

225
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,969
it did have audio it would have also

226
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,179
sped up and slowed down at the audio so

227
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,610
the audio would be like slower and lower

228
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,680
or be super fast and high-pitched like

229
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,800
the chipmunks so just keep that in mind

230
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,839
if you are doing with audio this speed

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,970
effect will also apply

232
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,930
change the speed of that audio as well

233
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,340
and check out a couple tutorials ago I

234
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,870
showed you how to actually even

235
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,420
right-click and go to split audio and

236
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,700
that'll actually split the audio out of

237
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,040
your video clip if you want us to leave

238
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,990
the audio or you can click over here and

239
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,260
mute the audio as well well I hope

240
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,090
you've enjoyed watching this video go

241
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,740
ahead and catch I'll catch you on the

242
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,390
next one in the next tutorial we're

243
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,890
going to be changing we're going to be

244
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,470
applying a crop to the video so we'll

245
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,120
change we can zoom in and look at just

246
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,370
one portion of the video and we'll also

247
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,290
learn how to how to move around the

248
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,730
video and transform it so catch on that

249
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,190
video if you're interested go ahead and
