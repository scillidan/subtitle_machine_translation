1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,679
in this video we'll be using free

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,680
software caden live to do this speed

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
effect with a blur we'll be increasing

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,960
the speed quite a bit and we'll also be

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,200
doing slow and we'll be doing this using

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
the speed remapping tool in caden life

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
so to get started we'll drag our video

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
clip down this is just drone video

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,359
footage um from a gopro

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,840
so it's a mp4 format and we're going to

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,599
go to the point that we want right now

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,279
everything's just slow

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,480
and so this is the part we want to be

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
speeding up this sort of pan around

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,280
these bikers on top of this ramp

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
we'll start by trimming the clip just a

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
little bit so that it starts in where we

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,960
want and we'll trim it out so it'll end

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
here just we're just trimming the start

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
and end of the clip not adjusting speed

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
at all yet so this will be the clip that

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
we're working with

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
we can right click and go to time remap

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,960
and that brings up this interface down

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
here in the bottom left hand corner and

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
we can see we have our source clip on

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
the top and then our output on the

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
bottom and this lets us remap or change

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
the time of the video so what we're

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
going to do is we're going to click here

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159
to add a keyframe

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,360
and we'll go forward to the point we

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,280
want the time to change back

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
to so it all in between there's going to

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
be fast speed we'll click to add another

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
keyframe and then if we drag this lower

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
one we're basically telling it fit

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
everything that was going to be in there

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
into this a tiny time frame so it makes

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,360
it basically

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
almost nine times faster so so over this

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
time it's going to very quickly play all

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
what was normally going to be about

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
three or four seconds and play it in

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
about half a second

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
and then we can do the same thing later

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,079
on in the video we can add another

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
keyframe and we can either manually move

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
drag the node like we did

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,399
or we can just come down below so we'll

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,240
add these two key frames and then in

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
between these two we'll just change the

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,520
speed and we can change it manually by

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,840
just typing in 50 and that'll make it 50

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
percent or half the speed that it

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,960
normally was

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
and this is shot at um i think the shot

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
at 120 fps so we can slow it down it'll

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
still look nice and smooth

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
over here under effects

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
we can click on this

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,318
keyframe and we'll add a blur we'll add

63
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
a box blur and we'll add a keyframe in

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
and we have to actually add it up here

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,440
at

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
on the effect we have to add the

67
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
keyframes in the same point

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
this is going to create a blur and

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,239
that's because if we just speed up it

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
looks a little bit unnatural and so this

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
way we can blur while we're moving

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
quickly it kind of simulates what that

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
motion blur will look like

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
and we'll add this blur on the

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
horizontal axis instead of the vertical

76
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
and then that way since we're moving

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
horizontally that's just kind of the

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
direction we want the blur

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
and we can change the way that it enters

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
into this blur change it to smooth

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,879
and so here's the final result

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
so a really good tool to get familiar

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
with this time remapping hopefully you

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,519
found this video informative go ahead

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,640
and leave your questions comments below

86

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,800
catching you in the next video
