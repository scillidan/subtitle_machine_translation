00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,640
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,049
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:07,980
kdenlive

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,469
in this video we're going to be adding

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,570
video and audio effects so we're just

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,349
going to go through some of the

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,119
different effects that kdenlive has to

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,070
offer there's a lot of them solicits

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,570
gonna be a brief introduction of how to

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,740
apply the effects and some of the

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,150
different ways to use them

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,429
if you're curious of how we got to this

13
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,589
point watch the last tutorial we

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,080
downloaded some footage and we just were

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,019
just using this audio and video and we

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,310
kind of created some different spaces

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,540
I'll show you what this video looks like

18
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,210
so we kind of we set up we split our

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,320
audio files so we have two different

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,330
audio clips and then we just kind of

21
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,310
broke up these and we could have put

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,900
these all down on the same video track

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,980
but we have them on three separate

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,400
tracks just because we can and for fun

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm gonna to get started though I'm

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,640
gonna left click on this bottom most

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,240
audio track I'm hit the Delete key and

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,920
we'll just delete that audio portion out

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,460
of there and yeah so we'll just we'll

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,570
leave the at the track we could delete

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,099
the track all together too by going to

32
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,390
delete track but I'll just keep it in

33
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,370
there for now and again if you ever want

34
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,930
to add a track you can right click and

35
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,540
just insert you can add an audio track

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,040
or a video track in there as well so to

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,540
apply effects let's say we want to have

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,460
each one of these different so every

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,850
time it changes to its recent kind of

40
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,560
goes black then it resets and shows a

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,280
different portion let's let's change on

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,990
just on the video let's see if we can

43
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,659
grab a nice video effect to change the

44
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,940
look of the video every time it goes to

45
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,909
a different clip so we'll start with

46
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,500
this one here and these are the

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,900
different effects we have to play with

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,430
so we can click this little triangle and

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,650
it brings up different effects and if

50
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,120
you have an effect in mind you can also

51
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,330
just type it in like mute for audio we

52
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,190
can mute the audio or we can do like a

53
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,390
zoom and so like position and zoom I'm

54
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,500
not sure what we have as far as eye

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,049
color goes so I'll type in color so we

56
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,130
have all these different things under

57
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,350
miscellaneous under color let's try like

58
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,878
this Technicolor I actually don't know

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,318
what it does if we hover over it it

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,719
tells us over saturate the colors in a

61
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,780
video like

62
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,420
old Technicolor movies okay cool so if

63
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,220
we want to use this one I'm gonna left

64
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,780
click and just drag it over top of

65
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,030
whatever clip we want it to go in let's

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,950
put it in this first one and then it

67
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,569
brings up these properties over here and

68
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,660
again if depending on your layout and

69
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,450
the everythings are always changing from

70
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,830
different releases that it may be

71
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,800
different but we can move this so for

72
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,890
example we could put it in here and then

73
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,950
it appears as a tab below so see now we

74
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,440
have all of our effects like we had

75
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,060
before but then if we want to see the

76
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,440
properties of that effect we click on

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,480
properties or I can left-click and drag

78
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,250
and put it in its own window here which

79
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,800
is what I've done okay so the properties

80
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,450
for get to wherever the properties for

81
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,380
that those this effects is properties

82
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,959
are and then we can look at some

83
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,610
different ways we can change them so by

84
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,200
default we see if we go to the clip

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
ahead we see this one looks normal

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,569
ish and this one's kind of more the

87
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:13,569
colors are a lot more dramatic we can

88
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,340
make them even more if we want to get

89
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,350
completely like really dramatic effect

90
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,150
yeah this is a pretty good Technicolor

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,220
filter that's cool so this is the

92
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,959
original and then this is the improved

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,820
one we'll just leave this exactly how it

94
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,860
is now let's move on to our next clip

95
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,400
and let's find a different kind of for

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,650
this one let's do a cover rise to so

97
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,120
under cover eyes we can hover over and

98
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,610
see colorize images to select hue

99
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,130
saturation lightness so that's good I'm

100
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,820
the left click and drag this one in and

101
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,920
this one will just leave well will couch

102
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600
we can change the saturation of this

103
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,670
color the lightness and darkness let's

104
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,870
make let's make it a little bit more

105
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,209
dark maybe and then the hue is gonna be

106
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,359
that the color that we have it be so you

107
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:56,590
know one cool effect might be to just

108
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
colorize each one of these a different

109
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,989
color but let's let's make this one what

110
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,470
we're going to do red let's make it

111
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,630
doesn't really matter yeah sure we'll

112
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,640
make it red alright cool so now we have

113
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,470
this one which is like full bright color

114
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,120
this is the original kind of what's

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
going to then it's gonna get intense

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,289
saturation then it's gonna go to like

117
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,690
this red a little bit darker alright

118
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,930
what should we do for this third clip

119
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,130
let's watch and see what we have so far

120
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,120
just so you know what's going on

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,590
[Music]

122
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,270
yeah it kind of went a little bit fast

123
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,420
but that's okay so let's go here to this

124
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,580
third clip and let's see what we have if

125
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,190
I delete everything here let's try maybe

126
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,680
this blur let's make one like really

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,920
blurry so let's go to this blur we hover

128
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,030
over blur using 2d iir filters okay

129
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,780
let's try that

130
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,450
so we'll hover we'll drag this blur and

131
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,760
to this third one and then we see the

132
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,100
the type of blur we want to do so this

133
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,110
is low-pass what we have now and then

134
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,820
the amount we don't want to get too

135
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,860
crazy sometimes with these if with the

136
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,380
effects it's not as refined as some

137
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,470
software so if you try to mix effects

138
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,890
and your you specify like if we type in

139
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,930
a million here it might actually crash

140
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,290
kdenlive especially on windows maybe not

141
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,450
so much on linux but so just be careful

142
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,090
to not ever get too crazy with some of

143
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,610
these but here we have a nice blur so

144
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,470
we'll get a look at pretty extreme blur

145
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,160
there we go so now we'll have our kind

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,500
of saturated look Technicolor we have

147
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,300
our red color this one just gonna be

148
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,550
blur and then this one is gonna be

149
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,490
irregular again until till we change it

150
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,130
and so again it applies it to this whole

151
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,810
clip and the reason it's doing these

152
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,150
clips we put this black space in between

153
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,780
we didn't have to do that but anything

154
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,850
the whole duration of the clip if we

155
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,620
were to apply it a fill and effect to

156
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,780
this the whole extents of this red

157
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,880
selection box is what the effect will be

158
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,980
applied to and in fact will apply some

159
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,080
effect to this audio here too and so

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,600
it'll apply to the entire audio unless

161
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,010
we were to cut it if we want it to only

162
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,440
apply to the first half we just go to

163
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,840
the razor tool and then cut and now we

164
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,610
have two separate we have a beginning

165
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,000
audio and then a later audio I'm gonna

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,390
hit ctrl Z to undo that cut let's add

167
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,580
one more video effect to our final last

168
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,400
video and let's do something really good

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,430
for this distort okay mm-hmm what's wave

170
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,780
a hover over it to read first wave make

171
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,540
waves on your clip with keyframes we

172
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,590
okay we don't wanna do anything with

173
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,580
keyframes right now so

174
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,680
let's do this distort plasma wheel this

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,460
hover will drag it in distort move I

176
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,960
don't want to do anything too taxing

177
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,780
because I don't want to crash kdenlive

178
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,000
oh cool oh man so this is gonna this one

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,340
is gonna actually distort as it's going

180
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,949
it's sort of like changing the trees you

181
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,940
see the whole picture

182
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,280
is being distorted so let's not look

183
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
kind of interesting all right that's

184
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,800
kind of cool this whole thing what we

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,979
really should do is apply a a speed this

186
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,419
is actually a little bit too fast but I

187
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,950
can just hover over and scrub through

188
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,020
and we kind of see what these effects

189
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,419
would look like in slow motion so we've

190
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,740
got these different effects that we've

191
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,850
applied to the video and that's a cool

192
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,320
one see that one's changing the whole

193
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,150
kind of video distorting and then it

194
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,220
goes back to our last one alright this

195
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,630
video is getting long let's apply one

196
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,440
more final effect to our audio down here

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,810
so under audio you noticed like if we go

198
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,090
to color and we try to apply a colorize

199
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,340
to our audio I don't know what it'll do

200
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,320
but I want to try it right now but what

201
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,850
we want to do there's certain effects

202
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,639
that are for audio some of the effects I

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,490
will say like fade work on video and

204
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,470
audio if you want to fade in our video

205
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,360
we can left-click and go to the start of

206
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,930
this video and it will fade in now oh

207
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,250
that that's not the fading in it it did

208
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,580
let's see what did it do oh just kidding

209
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,349
maybe this fade in is only from audio oh

210
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:08,580
we have to go fade from black that's

211
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,770
what we do so fade from black then it'll

212
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,599
be this video clip will start a black

213
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,889
and it will fade in

214
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,139
but the fade in here is actually an

215
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,139
audio so it says fade in audio track and

216
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,330
if we hover over this it says fade video

217
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,220
so some of them even though this is

218
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,470
under fade I guess what I want to say is

219
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,740
there's audio and video effects within

220
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,750
the same thing so you want to always

221
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,760
hover over and see if what you're doing

222
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,940
is for video or audio and if you don't

223
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,159
know just try and see what happens but

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,409
we're going to fade in the audio right

225
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,900
here and then we're going to fade out

226
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,050
the audio right here and what that does

227
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,730
it gives us a nice so under under this

228
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,380
first one we have - we have a fade in

229
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,329
and fade out and we can change the

230
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,290
duration

231
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,420
let me delete the second one first so

232
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,190
under our fade in we see it starts with

233
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,430
this red and then it goes here so by the

234
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,290
end it's up to full volume and at the

235
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,090
start it's almost silent if we play

236
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,740
right now we'll see it's just gonna be

237
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,010
kind of like silent then it gets louder

238
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,270
and louder I guess it's not that

239
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,460
dramatic cuz it's a short clip but we

240
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,260
can change the duration by doing this

241
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,610
and it changes that triangle a little

242
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,620
bit so we can see you know how quickly

243
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,810
it fades in so maybe I'll do mine to

244
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,500
about there so within the first little

245
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,910
part of the video it's up to full volume

246
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,150
then on my fade out I'll drag it on and

247
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,130
the fade out will do the same thing

248
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,530
we'll lower it so our fade-out is

249
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,450
happening at the kind of quickly at the

250
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,570
last portion of the video look and sound

251
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:44,280
like this okay very very quick you know

252
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,930
little video let's render it out and see

253
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,370
what happens so if we go to render I'll

254
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,670
click mp4 I will save it to my desktop

255
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,700
like I always do we'll call this bike

256
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,660
and hit save then we can render to file

257
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,150
so so render out it's not taking too

258
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,450
long depending on what effects you use

259
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,270
the rendering time can be very very long

260
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,770
but now will minimize we'll watch this

261
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,190
and see the house

262
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,599
[Music]

263
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,430
okay so again super short super super

264
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930
short but at least it rendered quick and

265
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,370
I think you're getting the idea of how

266
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,809
these effects work so we just drag and

267
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,459
drop them in and then once there's an

268
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,370
effect on sometimes it'll show like the

269
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,199
fades you can see with a little overlay

270
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,029
and if you click on it it'll show what

271
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,040
effect it has and just like we did with

272
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,050
the audio we have multiple effects you

273
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,149
can apply different effects so we can

274
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,189
have two different color Corrections on

275
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,249
top of the same one we have a blur and

276
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,290
the color rise and then if we want to

277
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,579
disable that effect you can actually

278
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,740
disable the blur so if you want to do a

279
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,720
colorize which ones I apply that to yeah

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,139
this one so if we wanted to apply this

281
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,629
blur this colorize we want to look at it

282
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,670
without the blur we can just click into

283
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,319
hurry and quickly disable that effect

284
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,029
while we're changing it and then we can

285
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,629
re-enable it so that's using effects in

286
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,399
