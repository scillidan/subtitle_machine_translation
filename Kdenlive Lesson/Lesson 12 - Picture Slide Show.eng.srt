00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome to another video editing

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,360
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,360
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,599
creating a picture slideshow so we don't

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,980
have to just use kdenlive for video

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,509
editing we can also bring in pictures

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,730
and we can apply the same effects that

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,050
we've been learning about then different

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,390
options to those pictures we can add

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,939
music to be playing while the pictures

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,830
are being displayed so I'm just going to

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,169
go to a few different places on my

13
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,240
computer where I have some pictures I'll

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,710
just left-click and drag those into my

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,710
project bin over here and then we see we

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,940
can look at these different pictures and

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,440
see which ones we want to add maybe I

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,150
want to add this picture first

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,130
so I'll left-click and drag it down to

20
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,830
this video one track and then for the

21
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,570
next picture I'll do this one of the guy

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,510
falling and for the last picture I'll do

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,070
the one with the little boy so we drag

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,650
and put them all in here and now we have

25
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,360
these different pictures we can see with

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,850
your play by default these are gonna be

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,190
five seconds long each I'll just resize

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,520
the timeline here yeah so by default

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,349
they're each five seconds long and that

30
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,730
might be a little bit long for me like

31
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,220
if we click play we can see it shows the

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,800
picture for quite a while then it

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,370
switches right to the next picture but

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,110
we can resize them we can go down we can

35
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,550
actually just double click on the clip

36
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,400
and it says duration five five seconds

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
so we can change this and type in 4 or

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,340
even 3 and hit OK and it'll look length

39
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,070
lower the length of that to 3 so we can

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,390
go to each of these clips and do that if

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,620
we want go 3 enter double click give it

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,380
a three and then it enter or hit the

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,540
okay button and now there are three

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,760
seconds long each we can drag them so

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,080
they're close together otherwise we get

46
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,240
this black if we didn't drag it close to

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,549
each other we'd get a black gap in

48
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,340
between the pictures so we drag them so

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,630
that they just goes from one picture to

50
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,700
the next and then when we play it just

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,640
goes and transitions just cuts over to

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,619
the next picture another way that you

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,020
can change the length of how long it's

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
being displayed for is by hovering to

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,260
the end of the video clip or the

56
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,869
beginning of the picture clip of

57
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,669
whatever it is and then you can drag it

58
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,740
out and make it longer or

59
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,510
shorter so whatever one's selected is

60
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,700
who the ones will do so we'll make that

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,010
always a little bit shorter and that

62
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,820
looks pretty good

63
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,980
so now our total video project is like

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,890
what seven or eight seconds long or not

65
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,720
even about five seconds long so now

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,010
we'll play all these clips within a

67
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,760
period of five seconds just very quickly

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,420
playing through a couple different

69
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,410
pictures yeah that's that's the basic

70
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,540
that's basically it we could edit this

71
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,310
picture we see it we have black bars on

72
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,900
the right and left side of this picture

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,060
so we could edit this picture in like

74
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,280
Photoshop or to make sure that it

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,580
fits a 1920 by 1080 make sure it fits

76
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,650
like a widescreen view same with these

77
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,210
ones these ones are actually even have a

78
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,470
little bit of bars on the side of them

79
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,870
because it's not exactly a full

80
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,950
widescreen picture but we can also edit

81
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,620
it here in kdenlive if we'd rather do

82
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,330
that so I'll show you like this one for

83
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,750
example we just go to crop and transform

84
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,390
and then we do this edge crop so I'll

85
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,160
left click and drag it over top of the

86
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,380
picture and if we get these options over

87
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,630
here in properties come up if these

88
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,100
don't come up for you sometimes they're

89
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,080
they're hiding within here it's a

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
separate tab so we've got effects

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,670
transitions and properties but I have

92
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,380
mine configured so that it's over here

93
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,690
and again if you couldn't find the

94
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,220
effects that's where they were to you

95
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,480
were about maybe looking at transitions

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,400
and not effects so I always look there's

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,170
tabs under all these different things

98
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,510
there's always tabs that can confuse you

99
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,800
if you know if you're not on the right

100
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,110
tab anyway so right now we have this

101
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,180
clip selected properties we can just

102
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,160
crop the sides so we want to crop the

103
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,690
the right-hand side and the left-hand

104
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,240
side so we should go over to right and

105
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,270
we crop in a little bit and what that's

106
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,970
doing is just kind of cutting in oh I'm

107
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,160
just I'm kidding actually we didn't want

108
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,810
to do that because to get rid of this

109
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,370
black box we actually need to crop the

110
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,650
bottom and top so and I mean I don't

111
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,700
want to crop the top any because I'll

112
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,720
cut it into the face

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,090
so I'm going to crop the bottom so by

114
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,910
cutting out the bottom of the picture it

115
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,430
actually gets rid of these black lines

116
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,170
because it's making our picture more of

117
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,209
the shape we want it to be does that

118
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,579
make sense so we cut out a bunch of the

119
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,530
bottom and then it just kind of made

120
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,340
this picture fill our full screen

121
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,320
a better example might be this one of

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,970
the little boy so let's come over here

123
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,840
and this one I'll do a edge crop we drag

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,380
this over and now this one we want we

125
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,330
this one we do want to crop to the left

126
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,790
and the right don't we know this is the

127
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,169
same thing we want to crop the top and

128
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,639
the bottom because we want to cut off

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
this much of the top and cut off of this

130
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,870
much of the bottom so that all we're

131
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,600
viewing is just in on the face so if we

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,750
start cutting it right here that's

133
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,729
pretty good that's about as far in and

134
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,229
we want to be about that far away from

135
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,510
the chin and then we go to the top and

136
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,030
drop in a little bit more to and then we

137
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,550
get a nice shot just like this that's

138
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,680
pretty cool huh this is easier to deal

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,720
again and like or Photoshop but you

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,550
can I just want to show that you can do

141
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,330
it using this yeah this edge crop so now

142
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,760
we see we have a nice picture we didn't

143
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,020
do the one of the following so we still

144
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,280
have the black bars on the side but

145
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,740
that's okay and then we have a nice this

146
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,940
one looks a lot better than it did

147
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,470
before see before if we turn off this

148
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,510
effect it was so far out and you

149
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,100
couldn't really see now we can see a lot

150
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,110
more detail and just fills the whole

151
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,700
screen which looks a lot better yeah

152
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,110
that's all I want to do in this video oh

153
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,150
let's add music real quick so just for

154
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,880
fun we can go to our downloads I should

155
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,200
get some more music I still have just

156
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,510
this one kind of video this clip so

157
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,240
we'll drag it down to our audio and then

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,620
we can do the same thing with the audio

159
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,060
to resize it hover to the end just

160
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,940
left-click and drag all the way now our

161
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,160
audio is just the same length as our

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,590
video project which is a picture

163
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,900
slideshow so we'll play this see it

164
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:07,570
looks like cool so that's it in the next

165
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,099
video I'm gonna keep this all up in the

166
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,960
next video we'll be looking at using

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,599
different transitions to create like a

168
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,400
transition effect between the pictures

169
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,050
and sit adjust I could cut over like

170
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,200
this will transition hopefully you found

171
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,669
this video informative go ahead and like

172
