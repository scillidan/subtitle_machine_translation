00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,130
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,570
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,450
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,999
working with multiple videos on multiple

5
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,159
video tracks and showing kind of the

6
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,500
priority and which video will get played

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,960
on top of another video so basically

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,259
we're gonna be playing multiple videos

9
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,400
yeah I'll show you how that's done so I

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,839
grabbed some video footage from

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,830
pixabay.com these are videos you can

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,359
hover over and kind of see it if we

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,040
click on them we can just go it download

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,320
so this is like I think it's one of the

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,970
clips I did this actually has some audio

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,490
with it and then I'm gonna drag these in

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,230
so I have three video clips there in my

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,450
downloads folder I'm just going to drag

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,240
them into my projects folder I'm left

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,550
clicking and dragging these in and then

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,740
we can watch them in our projects we can

22
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,820
just like to see what the video looks

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,830
like so this Mercedes ones actually

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,270
already been edited and cut together

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,740
it's a bunch of different Clips that's

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,510
been edited sometimes some of them are

27
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,130
even like slowed down they adjusted the

28
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,930
speed of it like I think right here it

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,720
drives through some water maybe like

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,990
slow motion and so but what I want to do

31
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,400
which one has the audio I think it's

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
this one Edison has audio so we can see

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,530
a little blue audio line right at the

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,659
bottom it shows two audio waves I'm

35
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,430
gonna left click and drag this down to

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,350
our video one because I want this to

37
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,750
kind of be the base the base of our

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,470
video like the constant so this video is

39
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,360
gonna play the whole time in the

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,130
background of our video and it's also

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,790
gonna be playing this audio of like cars

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,680
driving since the other two videos don't

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,630
have any audio with them so then I'm

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,909
just gonna drag and drop onto video

45
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,979
track to will drag this one here of the

46
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,750
freeway and onto track three that's one

47
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,299
of the Mercedes so if you see what

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,970
happens we were watching this video that

49
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,680
had the audio we're on our project

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,380
monitor right now oh now we're on a

51
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,090
project monitor so we were watching this

52
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,130
video below but now we're seeing the

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,840
Mercedes if I left click and drag the

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,760
Mercedes over here forward in time and

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,130
then unclick we see the video changes

56
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,990
because the playhead is looking at this

57
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,990
video now so between these two the

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,628
playhead it's choosing to view whatever

59
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,109
it is the topmost video so the higher

60
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:13,960
the number of the video

61
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,630
track the more the top the more priority

62
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,890
it has to get seen

63
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,050
but both videos are playing at the same

64
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,640
time so if we play this right now

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,750
we'll see or we'll hear the audio from

66
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,510
this lower video but we're seeing the

67
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,700
video from this top video that makes

68
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,040
sense so if we drag this out of the way

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,230
and now we're seeing just this one video

70
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,100
that has the audio with it so what we

71
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,360
can do this is something I do a lot

72
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,460
actually I'll have one video playing

73
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,200
constantly especially if you have

74
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
multiple camera angles of the same thing

75
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,130
happening like an interview you have a

76
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,350
camera pointing at someone's face or I

77
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,700
can't a camera pointing at the

78
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
interviewer and then a camera pointing

79
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,430
at the interviewee I'll have one of the

80
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,930
interviews playing that has the best

81
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,090
audio at the bottom and then I'll have

82
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,670
I'll bring in other clips just short

83
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,100
versions of it so we can grab this razor

84
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,170
tool and just cut out like a really

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,870
short clip here then go to my selector

86
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,090
tool and know this drag it in here and

87
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,340
maybe we can even drag in this little

88
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,830
piece that we had will have that be the

89
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,630
start and we'll go to there and then

90
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,340
it'll come in then maybe we'll have the

91
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,070
Mercedes one start so what this will do

92
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,200
is it's going to play I'll just click

93
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,850
and drag so it's going to play this

94
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,230
video and then when I gets to this point

95
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,720
it's going to play the video underneath

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,710
and then it's going to play this video

97
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,830
and it'll play the video underneath and

98
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,170
we'll play the Mercedes video while

99
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,240
still playing the audio so we'll just

100
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,500
click and actually just play it and

101
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,650
watch

102
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
we'll see where the playhead is going

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,060
now it's playing this freeway video

104
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,980
because it's on video too now it's gonna

105
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,810
drop down and play on video track 1

106
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,160
because there's nothing in video track 2

107
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,800
right now and it's gonna jump back up to

108
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
video track 2 and play whatever is in

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,060
there while still playing the audio in

110
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,840
the background

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,310
so really it's playing this background

112
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,870
video we just can't see it because it's

113
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,980
being covered up by video 2 and so in

114
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,240
the last video we learned about how to

115
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,220
transform just so we can kind of drive

116
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,980
this home no pun intended

117
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,190
let's go to crop and transform we'll

118
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,589
drag a transform into here and if we

119
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,780
change the size of this video then we

120
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
can actually see what's happening now we

121
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,690
see we've got this video playing down

122
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,180
below and also this video playing up

123
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,770
here and we can drag and have it be

124
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,740
playing down here if we want so that's

125
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,630
pretty cool huh and we can even do all

126
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,580
three of them if we want to we can drag

127
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,740
this one and I'm gonna resize this I

128
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,580
think I talked about this in another

129
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,170
tutorial but you might have forgot if

130
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,370
you go to the end of the video you can

131
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,530
actually just click and resize the video

132
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,630
as long as you're not trying to go past

133
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,450
the extent of the video or further

134
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,520
forward in the beginning of the video so

135
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,020
at these video clips that we cut over

136
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,730
here we can drag them and make them a

137
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,090
little bit longer as long as we don't go

138
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,030
past the extents of that so in fact I'll

139
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,320
put this back where it was though I'm

140
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,970
gonna move this up top here and we're

141
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,070
gonna keep it the same length as this

142
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,110
Mercedes video but we'll apply a

143
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,990
transform to it as well and we'll resize

144
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,100
it as well so now we've got all kinds of

145
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,410
different video happening here we've got

146
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,290
the Mercedes video I'll put it right

147
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,800
there so now when we play this might

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
take a little bit to play but now we see

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,640
the first-person view of driving this

150
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,650
car we see the Mercedes driving through

151
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,150
water and we see all these cars going

152
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,250
here so that's kind of how do video and

153
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,920
video or a picture-in-picture

154
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,420
I'm gonna do it I'll do another tutorial

155
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,070
on that later showing how to do like

156
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,900
desktop tutorials where it has your face

157
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,360
in the bottom right hand corner and then

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,190
it'll have like your desktop screen and

159
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,710
the for the rest of it but that's

160
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,360
basically how you accomplish it is it's

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,490
playing all three videos on all three

162
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,680
video tracks and I guess just to get

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,259
here let's just add in some audio too so

164
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,100
I'll drag in this audio file then we can

165
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,960
really open I mean just fit okay and

166
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,360
then it'll put it down here so then we

167
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,789
really have a lot going on

168
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,830
we're playing audio from here we're

169
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,229
playing three sources of video and two

170
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,080
of the video are resized to be on top of

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:32,229
each other our music it's a little bit

172
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,210
laggy because it's trying to do its rap

173
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,139
is trying to read 3 3 720p videos and

174
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,449
also play the audio and also apply the

175
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,610
transforms and all that so but when we

176
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,259
render it out it'll look just completely

177
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,780
normal and in fact I'll show you except

178
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,090
I do want to do this let's just take

179
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,680
this opportunity to learn how to use

180
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,560
this thing here whatever this blue area

181
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,139
is whatever selected in this blue area

182
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,050
is what will get played up here in the

183
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,419
player first of all and it's also what

184
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,360
we can we can render an export out so if

185
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,860
I just want to do it let's just do a

186
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,300
short portion here cuz I don't want to

187
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,370
take forever to render and then we click

188
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,500
up on render and then we just say

189
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,690
selective zone instead of full project

190
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,599
then it will only render that portion

191
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,650
that 10 seconds roughly is what it looks

192
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,780
like so and in fact I'm gonna make it

193
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,550
even shorter so that we don't wait let's

194
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,650
make it a teeny tiny and let's go to

195
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,620
render will render a selective zone and

196
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,130
we'll save it to the desktop and we'll

197
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,360
call it a whoops

198
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,070
we don't WebM though which we'll just

199
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,110
call it something and then we'll make

200
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,940
sure it's an mp4 so I like to you could

201
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,300
do WebM but mp4 is kind of this a good

202
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,130
standard for uploading to like Facebook

203
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,509
or YouTube and I'll just pause the video

204
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,380
while we render this out

205
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,819
okay so that took about 40 seconds to

206
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,860
render actually 48 seconds exactly to

207
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,110
render and will minimize and we'll just

208
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:14,440
watch this that's the video pretty cool

209
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
stuff so that's just a little hopefully

210
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,669
that kind of maybe cleared up some

211
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,009
things in your mind as far as how to use

212
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,629
these different tracks and then we can

213
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,699
add in you know multiple audio and if

214
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,870
you want to add in another track we can

215
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,849
just right click and we can go insert

216
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,669
track and we can add another audio track

217
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,629
Oh can't wait

218
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,740
audio - oh yeah we'll add an audio track

219
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,019
insert above audio - and we'll call it

220
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,339
wet it'll make it audio track and we'll

221
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,870
call it audio three and add so now we

222
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,110
have audio three we can rearrange it

223
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,050
somehow oh yeah I think we click this

224
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,300
button here anyway this is what you can

225
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,029
rearrange these as well so appreciate

226
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,140
you watching this video hopefully that

227
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,930
was informative catch on next one
