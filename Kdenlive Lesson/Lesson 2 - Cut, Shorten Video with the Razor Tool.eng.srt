00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,430
welcome back to another kdenlive video

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,890
tutorial the free video editing software

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,669
kdenlive

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,349
in this video we're going to be learning

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,199
how to shorten a video clip so maybe he

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,549
recorded something on your phone and

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,349
it's like five minutes long and you only

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,269
want to share a 30-second portion of it

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,920
this will be a great way to learn how to

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,539
do that and also it's going to teach us

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,640
and get us familiar with using this

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,900
interface and using some of the

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,849
different tools that kdenlive has to

14
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,249
offer so first we're gonna drag in a

15
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:31,499
video clip I'll go to my downloads I

16
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,510
have this video clip here this cyclists

17
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,820
getting on a bicycle so I just

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
left-click and drag it into my projects

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,780
bin and from there then I can drag it

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,760
down to my timeline we can only work

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,230
with things in our timeline that are

22
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,200
already in our project bin so here we

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,550
can watch the video right now if I click

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,140
play we can see what the video looks

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,060
like we're just kind of monitoring this

26
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,570
clip but we're not really looking at our

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,490
project so if we were to render out or

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,290
try and save this video it would just

29
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,240
come out black because if we click here

30
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
on our project monitor down here we have

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,010
no video no audio nothing happening in

32
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,710
our project we just have something we

33
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,540
just have a clip potentially we can work

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,850
with so since we do want to work with

35
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,200
this clip let's drag it into our

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,420
timeline so we'll left-click drag it

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,720
down and just throw it in the timeline

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,220
the timeline starts at 0 if you look

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,900
there's this white playhead here we can

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,030
actually click if we click up here in

41
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,140
this gray area we can click and see

42
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,030
different parts of this video so right

43
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,950
here we're looking at the video if we go

44
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,840
back here we're just seeing black so we

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,010
want to make sure our video is at the

46
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,710
very beginning of our project so do that

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,630
we'll left-click and drag all the way to

48
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,900
the start so now when we go back to 0 0

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,690
we see the very first frame of our video

50
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,560
is it's not black anymore like it was

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,690
it's actually showing our video which is

52
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,820
good and if we hit play we can play

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,900
through and watch and see what this

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,320
looks like so maybe this video is way

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,940
too long for us which really it isn't

56
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,490
it's only about less than 10 seconds

57
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,400
long but if we if we think it's too long

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,409
we want to make it shorter we can cut

59
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,538
and make it shorter to do that we'll hit

60
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,329
the X key so we hit the X key on our

61
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,860
keyboard and we get this nice

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,740
cutting scissor cursor option another

63
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,690
way we can do it I'm gonna hit s to go

64
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,130
back to what we're before so we can move

65
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,140
us around we can hit the scissor tool

66
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,910
here we just click on it and we get this

67
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,380
scissor tool to cut so I'm gonna hit

68
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,050
left-click on my clip and I'll cut and

69
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,790
I'll go back to my selection tool and we

70
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,460
can see we have two video clips now we

71
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,170
have one that's our first one we have

72
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,020
our second one so that's a way we can we

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,459
maybe we want to use this one somewhere

74
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,690
else or if we don't we can just hit the

75
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,030
Delete key while it's selected and it'll

76
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,160
be gone so now our video is only half as

77
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,360
long and yeah so we've just shortened

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,700
this video basically by half it's still

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,680
playing at the same speed so we go to

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,989
play we can see it's still playing at

81
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,080
the same speed that it was this little

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,459
blue thing that I just moved by the way

83
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,130
we see right here this is the extent of

84
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,980
our video so this blue line shows us how

85
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,200
long our video project will be when we

86
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,840
go to render we have an option we can

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,610
just render our whole every video clip

88
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,640
that's in our timeline as one option we

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,640
can also say only render to the extents

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,980
of this of this blue bar so if we want

91
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,530
our video to only be 20 seconds long we

92
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,970
would just set it right here at 20

93
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,040
seconds then our video would stop when

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,430
it got to 20 seconds but we'll use that

95
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,590
later it won't really apply to us in

96
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,030
this case that's one thought you know

97
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,160
because when you first start that's it

98
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,330
gets in the way sometimes when you're

99
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,860
trying to move the playhead you

100
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,390
accidentally move this blue thing

101
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,260
instead so that's why I bring that up

102
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,670
also with this video so we're on video

103
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,769
track 1 if we want to zoom in and kind

104
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,260
of see and make a more detailed cut we

105
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,459
can actually come down here to the

106
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,739
bottom right and we'll click and drag

107
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,630
this little square and we can it'll

108
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,600
resize the way we're looking at this

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,760
timeline so it'll kind of zoom in on

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,980
time it doesn't change the size of the

111
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,049
video actually in our project it doesn't

112
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,600
change how fast it plays or how long the

113
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,180
duration of it but it helps us get a

114
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
much more granular look now we can drag

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,488
and pan through and kind of see frame by

116
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,140
frame what's happening in this video

117
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,200
clip whereas before it was so small it

118
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,630
would have been hard to cut very

119
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,010
precisely

120
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,190
so that's how that works so we'll zoom

121
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,100
in here and sometimes if you have like a

122
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,290
two hour video project you know you

123
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,950
don't want to you know if one pixel a

124
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,260
fraction of an inch on your screen will

125
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,430
mean the difference between you know

126
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,380
five minutes of cutting video footage of

127
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,540
it so you need to zoom in to get a very

128
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,750
accurate look so yeah so we've cut this

129
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,700
we've cut this video let's let's go

130
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,810
through that one more time how to do

131
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,370
that I'll show you a third way if we go

132
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,300
up to tool and select this razor tool

133
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,950
that's how we get this it's this turns

134
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,420
to the scissor icon and then we can then

135
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,850
cut cut cut as many times as we've left

136
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,890
click it'll cut you can then create a

137
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,960
separate clip and then we go back to

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
this tool and go to our selection tool

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,740
and then we can actually select these

140
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,050
videos and move them around we can

141
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,850
select one and delete it if we want just

142
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,960
the Delete key

143
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,730
so what everyone has a red box around it

144
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,650
that's what's selected so now we've

145
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,510
really shortened this video a lot and

146
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,890
you see this is up here on video track

147
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,960
two which doesn't matter it'll still

148
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,830
play correctly when we play through but

149
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,020
for for all intents and purposes I was

150
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,300
our down play we should just keep

151
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,310
everything in the same track at least

152
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,950
for this video to avoid confusion so

153
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,360
everything's on video track one and

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,310
there's no audio with this video it's

155
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,530
completely silent if it had audio it

156
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,910
would be playing along with the video

157
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,710
and we're walk out we'll do it we'll

158
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,060
play out the audio in the next video as

159
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,700
well we can add music if we just bring

160
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,320
music in like if I want to bring an

161
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,110
audio file into here I can go find some

162
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,760
audio on my computer left click and drag

163
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,610
it in and we'll drag it down to the

164
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,980
timeline and then it will play audio

165
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,530
along with our video footage it'll

166
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,550
actually play there that sound is the

167
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,430
audio file playing so I'm going to

168
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,230
render this out very quickly in fact I'm

169
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,120
just going to drag this audio to here

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
will delete this last clip make a nice

171
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,200
short one I'll shrink the audio down to

172
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,570
about there and let's render this out so

173
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,030
to render to save our video if this is

174
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,710
all we want to do is cut our video and

175
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,360
then upload it to Facebook or YouTube or

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
somewhere we'll just click on render

177
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,890
well first of all I'll show you kind of

178
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,870
the wrong way to do it I guess if you go

179
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,860
to file save that's just gonna save a

180
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,960
kdenlive project

181
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,820
so we can we can do this we can save

182
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,460
under documents we can call it my video

183
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,160
and hit save and that will just save it

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,830
under it'll be a dot kdenlive file which

185
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,199
is good if we ever want to come back in

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,479
and define tweak and replace the audio

187
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,389
or make changes to this video project we

188
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,169
can do that but that video will not be

189
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,669
that that's just going to be a video

190
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,870
video project file

191
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,240
we can't upload the that this to YouTube

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,759
or or send it email it to a friend or

193
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,039
something so to actually render out a

194
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,330
video we click on render not save by

195
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:17,810
default

196
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,729
well first we want to do is choose out

197
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,410
choose our output file so where do we

198
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,000
want to render it to click these dots

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,560
here I'm gonna do mine to the desktop

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,110
and we'll just call it test we'll hit

201
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,259
save so the very first thing it has an

202
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,169
automatic default as this web M which

203
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,669
will be which would work it's a video

204
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,949
format not everyone not all players can

205
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,770
play that mp4 is a pretty widely known

206
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,900
pretty common one it's a good one to use

207
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,310
if you're uploading to YouTube or

208
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,210
Facebook if it's a final video so I'm

209
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,580
also at mp4 there's all these different

210
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,740
options for if we want to export the

211
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,599
audio only we can export different

212
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,880
lossless formats we can just export an

213
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,310
image sequence but for this we'll just

214
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,340
click mp4 choose your output location

215
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,159
like we did and then go ahead and save

216
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,930
and then we'll hit render Oh before that

217
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,610
I just want to show you right now it's

218
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,349
rendering the full project which means

219
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,330
it's gonna render the extent of all

220
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,699
video clips that we've added but that

221
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,990
blue thing I was talking about there's

222
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,810
this selected zone if we if we do

223
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,360
selected zone it'll only render the part

224
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,789
that we have selected in our selected

225
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,500
zone that'll make sense more on the

226
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,639
teacher we'll play with that a little

227
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,500
bit so make sure this says full project

228
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,169
and click render to file and this is

229
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,639
rendering out very quickly because it's

230
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,130
only what a two second three second long

231
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,399
video and now it's done rendering so we

232
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,919
can hit close here we can minimize and

233
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,229
go to the desktop and we can see this

234
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,750
video that we've created

235
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,649
that's it just keep looping over and

236
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,689
over again just a short little clip this

237
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:51,740
guy getting on his bike

238
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,389
and it's a little sound playing in the

239
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,430
background so I hope you've enjoyed this

240
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,980
