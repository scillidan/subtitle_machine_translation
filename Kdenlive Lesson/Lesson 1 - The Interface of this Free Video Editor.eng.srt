00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,790
hey guys welcome to this first video in

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,370
a series of tutorials teaching how to

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,919
use kdenlive so kdenlive has been my

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,869
go-to video editor for a long time now I

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,209
really love this software it's really

6
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,340
fairly simple to use and it's very

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,070
powerful professional software and I

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,269
would say it's pretty stable and

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,460
reliable I've used it under Linux for

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
the most part and I'm just now starting

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,660
to use it in Windows so I'm running

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,210
Windows 10 right now and I'm just want

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,560
to demonstrate this software so if you

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,540
haven't downloaded it yet go ahead and

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,640
you can check out my other video it's in

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,770
the description of this video it'll show

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,330
you how to download and get started on

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,600
Windows if you're using this on Linux

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,570
awesome good for you and yeah follow

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,070
along the interface is the same whether

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,430
you're on Linux Windows or Mac so yeah

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,410
let's dive into just getting familiar

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,540
with the interface first of all so at

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,520
the bottom here we have our timeline we

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,770
see we have video three two one audio

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,480
one and two these are our different

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,210
tracks to the right we have a black

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,519
screen this is our project monitor where

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,290
we can view

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,060
well actually it's we can do project

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,310
monitor or our clip monitor so we can

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,990
view clips that we want to add into our

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,000
project and then we can actually view

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,720
the audio and video of our project and

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,820
see what it look like with transitions

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,690
or effects applied and things like that

37
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,159
right here is the different options this

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,870
panel in the middle and all these panels

39
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,180
can be moved around by the way we can

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,500
move them and have them be up here

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,409
somewhere else so that they don't have

42
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,850
to stay right there we can drag and drop

43
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,260
and configure it to wherever we would

44
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,500
like but this is just the default layout

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,020
so this section is our options for doing

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,270
different kinds of effects we've got all

47
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,950
these different audio effects and video

48
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,960
effects and filters that we can apply

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,510
and we can just search for a certain one

50
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,640
if we want to do like a fade we can type

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,930
in fade and it'll show us all the

52
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,290
different fade options we have and then

53
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,670
over here on the left hand side is our

54
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,290
project bin so this is where we will put

55
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,440
all of our projects all of the data we

56
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,000
want to bring in so if we want to bring

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,090
in one for example right now we could

58
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,510
just go to project add clip and then we

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,100
find it will bring up a dial

60
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,660
and I just go to that place on my

61
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,120
computer where I want to add in so maybe

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,780
I'll do this

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,630
TJ intro and go open so this is the

64
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,290
intro screen for my video I'll hit play

65
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,000
and sometimes this is kind of a glitch

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,380
this is only happening to me in Windows

67
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,910
but I hit play and nothing happens I

68
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,470
have to give it a little jumpstart and

69
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,210
left click in the timeline and then

70
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,250
it'll go so that'll be fixed you know

71
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,750
probably by the time you're watching

72
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,100
this that glitch won't be here anymore

73
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,020
but at least it's happening to me on

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,670
Windows right now so if I could hit play

75
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,680
nothing happens I click the timeline and

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
it'll start playing so we can see this

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,870
video here it's in my project so it's

78
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,210
not yet in my timeline to get it down to

79
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,410
the timeline I have to left-click and

80
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,780
drag it down to either one of one of

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,600
these three tracks so the very lowermost

82
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,880
track is where I usually put it on video

83
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,580
1 and now we can come play it here on

84
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
our project and see what it looks like

85
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,040
awesome

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,790
that's pretty cool we can scroll here we

87
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,950
can scroll through we can use our scroll

88
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,300
wheel to kind of go to a different point

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,820
in the video this is on our project

90
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,860
monitor again and if we come down to the

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
timeline we can also click on the

92
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,270
timeline and see this is really small if

93
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,550
I want to make this appear larger I can

94
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,590
kind of zoom in so I can go down here to

95
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,300
the bottom right hand I can zoom and

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,090
make this kind of film or of this space

97
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,150
and at the top it shows the seconds so

98
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,420
this is point two seconds this is wait

99
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,750
what is that or 1 this is 1.2 seconds

100
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,550
right here this is 2 it's about a

101
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,080
two-second clip it says the seconds

102
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,459
across the top we can also get a video

103
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,130
and audio into our project by just

104
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,930
dragging and dropping so if you open up

105
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,030
a window I'll go to Maya downloads

106
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,140
folder actually I'll go to my music

107
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,730
first I have an audio file

108
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,070
I'll left-click and drag and drag it up

109
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,750
here you always have to put it into your

110
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,020
projects your project bin at first you

111
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,940
can't just drag it down into your

112
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,100
timeline it won't work you have to first

113
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,910
bring it in and Katyn life supports many

114
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,510
audio and video formats in fact I don't

115
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,130
think I've ever ran into trouble unless

116
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,040
you try and drag in something like well

117
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,988
you can even drag in a picture so that's

118
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,850
just a still shot a still image we can

119
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,950
drag that in but if we try to drag in

120
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,050
something that it doesn't

121
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,129
or what I'm trying to think real quick

122
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,220
like this Inkscape shortcut my goodness

123
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,229
it even lets us do that but some files

124
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,389
it doesn't let us do so just be aware of

125
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,599
that if it's like a non video a non

126
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,930
media format for example like this one

127
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,180
let's do that I want to try to get an

128
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,099
error message here it's just not letting

129
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,180
us do it let's go back here to downloads

130
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,550
and I can drag in I have this cyclist

131
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,669
video will drag in here and so oh it did

132
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,650
bring us an error message there we go it

133
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,199
says inks Oh perfect so yeah it wouldn't

134
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,669
let us if you try and drag something in

135
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,680
in that it doesn't support it'll just

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,330
come up with an error message and that's

137
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,979
what I was doing there it's saying we

138
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:07,810
can't do it

139
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,130
alright dragging the cyclists footage

140
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,440
and now I can I come toggle through and

141
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,639
look at all these I can look at this

142
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,550
picture look at this this is a vector

143
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,650
graphics image which is supported also

144
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,719
so if I want to have this picture I just

145
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,370
drag it down to the timeline I can put

146
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,740
it in here after a video one or I can

147
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,780
bring it up and have it be separate and

148
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,060
it's just gonna play this steel image

149
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,979
for a little while it's gonna keep

150
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,380
playing it we can go along this timeline

151
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,360
if I double click it'll tell me it's

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,289
playing for duration five seconds but I

153
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,969
can change this down to two seconds and

154
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,069
hit OK and now it's only gonna play for

155
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,319
two seconds so it'll play this little

156
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,690
video intro and then we'll also play

157
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,759
this video for two seconds this steel

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,310
shot here and if you want to add audio

159
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,740
to this we can just drag this audio file

160
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,949
that I brought in we'll put it down here

161
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,090
and see what this sounds like

162
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,510
[Music]

163
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,640
so then we have that audio file along

164
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,430
with this video footage so now we have

165
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,170
all three of these and if we overlap

166
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,700
this we can actually overlap and

167
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,830
whatever the higher number track is

168
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,310
that's what will be be displayed first

169
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,600
so as soon as it gets to this video

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,030
it'll start playing this next one after

171
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,540
that we're not gonna play any effects

172
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,920
right now because I'm actually going to

173
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,330
stop this video and we'll move on to the

174
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,150
next tutorial where we will get into

175
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,830
doing some of these effects but I just

176
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,740
wanted to show roughly I kind of wanted

177
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,120
to show the interface and what you can

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,950
do oh and one more thing will you'll

179
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,540
want to do is go into your project

180
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,860
settings so we go to project where's

181
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,140
that at

182
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,030
when you first open it you'll it should

183
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,590
bring up and say what kind of things do

184
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,840
you want to do well here this project

185
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,670
settings under project so the project

186
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,320
settings is where you'll decide if

187
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,390
you're doing 1080p video and what

188
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,150
framerate you're doing it at 29.97 so

189
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,340
what I have mine set at you can do for

190
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,560
you can add a 4k video we can have our

191
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,650
project be set up for just like 720 so

192
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,660
if you're not familiar with these you'll

193
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,790
want to learn and make sure that you're

194
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,280
editing in the right kind of thing I

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,700
usually do 1080p 30fps roughly for my

196
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,710
YouTube videos and this is the software

197
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,150
that I'll use to edit all my YouTube

198
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,960
videos and upload them and then you have

199
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
some different options up here too or we

200
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,470
can create a new project we can save our

201
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,140
project undo and redo and then we can

202
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,270
actually render out when we're ready and

203
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,480
we can save our video that's all I want

204
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,590
to show for this I don't want to get too

205
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,960
deep too quickly hopefully you've

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,730
enjoyed this video and I'll catch on the

207
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,990
next one where we'll dive deeper into

208
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,870
using the timeline and cutting video

209
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,410
splitting and merging video together

210
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,130
catch you on the next video
