00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,100
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,420
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,440
kdenlive

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,329
in this video I'm just going to go

5
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,009
through and demonstrate some of the

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,900
artistic video effects that you can

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,809
apply to video footage or to images so

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,240
to get started I'm just going to open a

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,820
couple clips we're going to do this one

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,279
of the cyclists here and we're also

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,550
going to just do a regular image so

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,019
we'll do and I'll just drag and drop

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,820
that one and I think it's under my

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
pictures yes we'll do this image here

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,830
with the fish okay great so I'm just

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,350
gonna drag in first of all my video

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,450
footage here and then drag in this image

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,890
which will just come in by default

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,260
before it'll play for 5 seconds this

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,780
video will and then it'll just go be the

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,760
end of the video so I can zoom in on my

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
timeline to have a better view here or I

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,060
can just click this button here if we

24
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,400
hover over hover over it it says fit to

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,680
zoom to project now just kind of zoom it

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,060
so we can kind of see our project nice

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,030
like that and then what I want to do is

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,950
get to the effects so we've got

29
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,450
transitions tab down here we have

30
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,400
effects you might need to click here

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,540
yours might be over in a different

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,820
location but regardless which want to go

33
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,590
into effects and then bring down this

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,260
tab for artistic click that little

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,730
triangle to the side of artistic and it

36
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,890
brings down all these different options

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,350
we can also just type in and search like

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,120
this dust if we want to find dust we

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,310
just type in dust and it'll bring up

40
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,010
just that one so we can search through

41
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,100
for any effect by just using the search

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,300
bar so let's just let's just start we

43
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,130
have this three level threshold the best

44
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,750
thing you can do is just just test all

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,400
these so we can left click and drag and

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,659
drop it over top of the video footage

47
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,820
and we see what it does and then we have

48
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,380
options for it over here with this one

49
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,180
there's not a whole lot of options we

50
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,640
can disable it basically or enable it

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,580
but that's about it

52
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,180
we have this one here binarize so this

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
turns everything binary based on the

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,659
cover of the pixel so we can have to

55
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,360
turn it basically black and white based

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,940
off of the lightness of the pixel so

57
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,490
it's kind of cool I'm going to delete it

58
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,049
another way we can add the effects to is

59
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,758
just going down to the video clip in the

60
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,159
timeline and right click and go to add

61
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,800
effect and then we can just go

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,930
which everyone we want and right now

63
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,220
we're doing artistic so we can go to

64
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,650
artistic and do this next one let's just

65
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,780
try cartoon and it creates kind of a

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,210
cartoony look and again we have options

67
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,060
for how we want to adjust this here so

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,380
we can kind of adjust it and make it

69
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,820
look a little bit different depending on

70
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,560
how we adjust up here I'll do this

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,230
charcoal will drag and drop into here

72
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,120
that's what charcoal looks like now I'm

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
going to move forward on my playhead to

74
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,120
this picture so we can apply this next

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,510
one

76
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,600
dither we'll apply it to this picture

77
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,870
here and again we have different levels

78
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,760
or different adjustments we can make to

79
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,650
change the way the effect looks on this

80
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,280
picture we can apply multiple to if you

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,230
want to do this dither and the dust at

82
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,880
the same time we just apply it over top

83
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,770
and then it changes that one we couldn't

84
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,120
really tell but if we did like this

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,580
binary that we did earlier it'll make it

86
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,080
look really extreme different I'm gonna

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,820
delete both these so to delete the

88
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,110
effect I'm just going up and clicking on

89
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,840
this red garbage can and the top right

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,510
of the kind of the project window or the

91
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,930
settings window for the properties what

92
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,300
else we got emboss but the cool thing is

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,980
though I should show you two so it's

94
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,510
applying it to the video it might take a

95
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,670
little bit of time to process but

96
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,400
actually we can play the video that's

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
kind of the cool thing about these

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,340
effects is that it applies it to the

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,040
whole video which is pretty cool like

100
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,170
this one we have old film so it's gonna

101
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,720
make it look like an old film and I

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,459
think that shakes a little bit and

103
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,570
flashes maybe yeah so that's how it does

104
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,880
that and we can combine old film with

105
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,300
grain I think and also with there's this

106
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,500
one vignette vignette vignette dad you

107
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,720
say this word and then we can also do

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,989
there's an alliance of-- somewhere I was

109
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,300
doing I have scratch lines so with all

110
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,330
these together it'll create a really

111
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,640
interesting look for like old film so we

112
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,290
have two lines these vertical lines

113
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,829
appearing we have like a yeah

114
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,589
anyway I I just want to show that you

115
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,810
can apply multiple effects over top of

116
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,000
each other to create kind of a cool

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,070
looking thing and you notice it's kind

118
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,669
of going slow it's a little bit

119
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,349
not up to full speed that's cuz its

120
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,810
processing all of these effects when we

121
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,310
actually render it out I'm gonna click

122
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,650
render and choose a place to save on our

123
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,050
computer it won't be like that it'll be

124
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,849
just a normal nice smooth video so yeah

125
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,379
I'm not gonna show any more of those but

126
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,360
that's basically it go through and play

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,550
with all these and get familiar with how

128
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,249
they work because yeah they provide some

129
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,439
pretty cool they can provide some pretty

130
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,849
cool effects on your video and pictures

131
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,139
that you're using in Caden life

132
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,430
hopefully you found this video

133
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,199
informative go ahead and like and
