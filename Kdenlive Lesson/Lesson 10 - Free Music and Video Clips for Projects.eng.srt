1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,080
tutorial with the free software kdenlive

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,690
in this video I just want to show you a

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,809
couple cool resources that you might

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,909
have been aware of in kdenlive

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:18,269
the first thing is let's say we have a

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,789
video clip let's grab in I'll just go

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,009
add clip and let's bring in one of these

9
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,630
ones we've used before like this cyclist

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,240
video and so we'll just click here to

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,610
zoom in so this video doesn't have any

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,650
audio so let's say we wanted to put in

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,330
like a sound effect at a certain point

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,310
in this video like when he's like

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,870
grabbing the bike or right when he's

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,150
about to write off so if we wanted like

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,850
a I don't know what the sound would be

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,280
but instead of going we can go to like

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,530
freesound.org or we can go record our

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,390
own sound but we can find some online

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,000
but also kdenlive has built-in options

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,400
if we go to project we can go to online

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,590
resources right here so under project

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,600
online resources it brings up this

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700
dialog box I think we can also do it by

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,650
clicking this triangle here yeah and

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,380
then we go to online resources and so

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,270
there's a couple different as of the

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,160
recording of this video there's three

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,810
different options we can search for

31
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,580
clipart which is going to be like vector

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
graphics and like just steal pictures of

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,860
usually like cartoony looking pictures

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,060
we can do archive.org video library and

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,920
any of these places we can just go to

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,020
directly as well

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
well this clip arts a collection of

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,950
places I think and there's free sound

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,210
audio library and so so if we if we want

40
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,340
to find a sound effect for this we can

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,049
even type we can even find music we just

42
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,930
type in music or maybe we type in jazz

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,110
if you want a certain type of music it

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,430
brings up all these different options

45
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,430
for files and it says here so this is

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,119
the duration of this is 15 seconds long

47
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,960
there's a couple different ones here

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,920
this one's three and a half seconds long

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,690
this is more jazz so let's do this 15

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,100
second one so we can actually click

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,690
preview to listen to it and see what it

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,020
sounds like

53
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,489
cool so if we like that we can actually

54
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,500
just click import and it says where do

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,310
you want to save it on your computer

56
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,439
will say save it under music we'll call

57
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,569
it yeah more jazz guitar dot mp3 click

58
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,540
Save and then it just is right there on

59
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,230
our computer

60
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,450
it actually downloads it and saves it

61
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,540
and brings it in to our as a resource we

62
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,670
can use in our project bin that's pretty

63
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,319
cool huh and then we can just drag it

64
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,900
down and now we have this music we can

65
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:45,400
play in our project pretty cool huh

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,930
and then if we wanted something to we

67
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,639
can grab if we want to play with green

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,709
screen or for example we can go to back

69
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,689
to the online resources we can go down

70
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,139
to well we can go to the video yeah

71
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,519
video library when you just type in

72
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,549
green screen maybe we want a video that

73
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,889
has green screen we click search and it

74
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,419
has all these different options now

75
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,519
these we can't preview at least not

76
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,889
within here to look at it like this

77
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,540
North I'm not sure which was we got here

78
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,739
we'll find one that we think might be

79
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,840
like pixie green screen it tells a

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,819
little bit about it and if we have all

81
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:19,930
the different options for how we can

82
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,459
import it they can be flash MPEG oh gee

83
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,989
geez we got these different options and

84
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,609
also has the license down here so this

85
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:30,250
ins we have to provide attribution to

86
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,470
the person that created it which it'll

87
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,530
say not sure where it says it we can go

88
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,599
to the website to find out and we can

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,099
not use it for commercial purposes and

90
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,870
it's under a share alike license but

91
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,060
they have different licenses so they'll

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,889
tell you and in fact that we should

93
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,449
looked at that one that we used that J

94
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,519
Deb jazz here oops

95
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,599
search we go back to find the one that

96
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,729
we used so that one was under Creative

97
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,930
Commons 0 so it's just very very open we

98
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,090
can use it for commercial purposes a

99
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,189
null attribute required but a different

100
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,090
ones have different so this is

101
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,069
attribution non-commercial if you're not

102
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,030
familiar with the Creative Commons

103
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,370
licenses I have I made a video about

104
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,720
that so you can check that out and learn

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
about with the difference license types

106
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,079
but just make sure you always understand

107
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,909
just because you can download something

108
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,048
off the internet doesn't mean it's

109
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,750
completely free to use for any purpose

110
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,010
you always have to check with what the

111
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,980
the author or the creator that has

112
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,350
allowed for those purposes to be used

113
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,070
for let's see what else okay so we've

114
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,990
got a clipart let's let's look at

115
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,760
clipart and we don't wanna search jazz

116
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,800
on clipart we want to search whatever we

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,490
want to do me we want to do oh so it did

118
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,860
jazz actually I don't know we can do

119
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,920
like a head and so it searches finds all

120
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
these different things for hat and then

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,770
we can go through and look and we can

122
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,210
look at though this is a public domain

123
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,510
police stop so we can be okay and if we

124
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,860
click the link we follow the link it'll

125
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,090
actually bring it up in the web browser

126
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,310
and we can look and see this is what it

127
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,080
looks like and then we can just download

128
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,830
it from here

129
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,320
or we could download it we can just

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,150
click down the import here and I'll say

131
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,740
where do you want to save it maybe we'll

132
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,800
put it under our pictures folder call it

133
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,410
police stop and this is an SVG image so

134
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,540
now it's there it's brought in now we

135
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,070
can bring it in and we could either have

136
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,440
it be as part of our video we can just

137
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,690
play it and we can't see it because it's

138
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,300
a black background or we can overlay it

139
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,510
over top here to the so now we've got

140
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:37,700
like this overlay yeah anyway that's

141
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,960
what I want to show you is these free

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,450
resources then also and this isn't

143
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,650
working for me I think it's because I'm

144
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,270
using a portable version on Windows but

145
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,310
this should work for you on Linux if you

146
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,280
over the settings here where was it at

147
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,630
you can go to download so we can

148
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,000
download new wipes so we can get all

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,720
kinds of different effects for wipes we

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,740
have all these different ones we can

151
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,950
just look at look at it see what it does

152
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,750
so like for like transitions wipes we

153
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,660
can also do we can download new title

154
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,920
templates and there's only a few of

155
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
these right now as of the recording of

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
this video but this could expand in the

157
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
future and if you're interested in

158
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,150
contributing you might be able to even

159
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,340
create some and then submit them as a

160
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,380
change since kdenlive is an open-source

161
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,830
project you can potentially could

162
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,560
contribute to this software and create

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,440
your own add-on templates to be added

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,390
into the software but anyway these are

165
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,560
some different ones that we can you can

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,439
download

167
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,249
and just shows you kind of what they are

168
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,869
and you can go to the website and

169
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,159
download and install them that way or

170
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,809
you can just do it from within the

171
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,300
software just click install and

172
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,009
uninstall all right well that is I think

173
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,679
what I wanted to show you also if you

174
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,119
need help there's like this we've got

175
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,519
the kdenlive handbook under help it just

176
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,929
goes and there's all kinds of different

177
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,989
if you're wondering about rendering

178
00:06:56,989 --> 00:07:00,449
there's some difference you know some

179
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,159
information here and again you could

180
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,919
contribute to this and actually help

181
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,979
improve this resource as well but just a

182
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,149
couple things I found when I was you

183
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,259
