00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,070
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,259
tutorial in the free software kdenlive

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,389
in this video we're going to be looking

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,730
at the crop and transform effects so

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,999
that we can change the look of our video

6
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:16,710
basically we can zoom in and just watch

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,810
one portion of our video like the top

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,330
right hand corner we can zoom out we can

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,009
drag and move the video around to a

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,320
different location to get started I'm

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,789
going to read in a video clip I'll just

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,699
click up here on my add clip and I can

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,250
find a nice clip here of this cyclist

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,710
that we've used in the past so if we

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,360
play this it just shows us here's the

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,430
cyclist grabbing his bike but maybe we

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,050
want to zoom in and only be we don't

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,360
want to see these bikes over here we

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,310
don't like the way that shot looks so we

20
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,720
can just zoom in and just see this

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,460
portion here there's a couple ways we

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,830
can do it but first let's left-click and

23
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,920
drag this down to our video track 1 so

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,130
we have our video here and I'm gonna go

25
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,600
to the bottom right and zoom in so we

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,030
can kind of see art a little bit larger

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,030
view of our timeline and now we can see

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,170
what this looks like I'm gonna left

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,270
click on the playhead and just hold and

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,150
drag until I get to the point so I can

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,100
kind of see so the camera does move a

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,660
little bit that doesn't really matter

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,130
let's just for all intents and purposes

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,870
let's just cut in maybe like where his

35
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,180
knees are and have the video be kind of

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,520
this portion here so we need to apply a

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,670
crop effect so we could just type in

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,470
crop up here actually it's not really

39
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,440
crop what we want to do even though the

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,210
effect is called crop it's under the

41
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,640
transform effect so we're gonna left

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,180
click on transform and drag it down into

43
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,470
here and then we see we have the options

44
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,500
appear under these properties and we can

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,820
have different in the last video we did

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,400
this speed under motion with speed and

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,370
we can actually apply multiple effects

48
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,860
to one single clip so right now we have

49
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,409
speed here and we have transform and

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,390
this little triangle which toggles which

51
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,950
one we're viewing we can be both at the

52
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,200
same time speed only has one setting to

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,500
change I'm going to delete it though and

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,510
but this transform effect has multiple

55
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,270
different settings so what for example

56
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,699
we can do the biggest thing by default

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,709
there's maybe size so we can come here

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,420
and change the size the size just like

59
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,830
we did with speed we

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,840
change the size at 200% and hit enter

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
and then it zooms in 200% based off of

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,270
the top left-hand corner we can then

63
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,970
change like this X&Y issues our scroll

64
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,190
wheel and change like slowly it's moving

65
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,560
over a pixel-by-pixel or we can type in

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,470
like negative 300 and it'll move over on

67
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,260
the x-axis that much but what we can

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,750
also do I'm gonna reset this back to how

69
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,190
it was I'll click these three lines here

70
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,590
and go to reset effect and that just

71
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,970
resets everything back to how it was

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,330
before we made any changes another way

73
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,560
we can move it around just by clicking

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,270
here there's a little dot in the center

75
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,950
we can left-click and then we can move

76
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,640
this video to any place we want if we

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,770
play the video it'll just play from

78
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,360
right there so it's actually playing

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,990
just has some black lines up here we can

80
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,940
resize so if we go to the edge we can

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,240
actually resize this and it's going to

82
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,550
resize it uniformly because we have this

83
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,730
little link checked here keep lock

84
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,030
aspect ratio so our width is now 602 and

85
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,580
our height is now 339 we see those

86
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,820
numbers change as we move this the size

87
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,000
changes so now it's 52% so that's

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
another way we can change it we can come

89
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,519
over here to the percentage and just

90
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,350
scroll wheel up and down and change it

91
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,070
we can do these different handles or

92
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,840
these different dots on the corner and

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,250
move it around that a change of size

94
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,989
that way and because I'm moving around

95
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,209
so those are the it's kind of cool the

96
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,130
different ways we have of changing this

97
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,980
video but yeah if we want to go in and

98
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,239
that's why it's kind of nice sometimes

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,340
use these numbers because if we actually

100
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,910
want to zoom in like greater than 100%

101
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,340
we start to lose that Center that Center

102
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,650
dot we don't know exactly where it is so

103
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,180
it's good it gets harder to move around

104
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,989
especially if we're in at like 300% then

105
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,250
it's hard to see so that's why it's nice

106
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,950
to use the X&Y in that case sometimes so

107
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,130
we might go negative 204 here or maybe

108
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,840
let's just go back to 0 and maybe that's

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,450
too much let's go to 200 on this ok so

110
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,950
now we can kind of see here but we can

111
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,690
barely see that little dot so we'll

112
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,209
bring it over to there so now let's play

113
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,010
this we can go back to the beginning or

114
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,900
roughly the beginning and we can play

115
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,480
and see he's grabbing the bike

116
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,370
going and if we want to see what this

117
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,420
looks like compared to the original

118
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,580
video we still have it over here in our

119
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,130
project bin we can click on clip monitor

120
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,520
and we can see what it looks like there

121
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,530
so here is this is what our project

122
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,450
looks like and in the clip monitor this

123
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,890
is what the original shot looked like so

124
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,170
we can see how far in we are how far

125
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,000
cropped in we are yeah

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
that's basically it there's also

127
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,340
rotation so if we go back to a project

128
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,010
monitor we can also rotate this shot so

129
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,960
we probably this is pretty level if I

130
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
wouldn't want to but we could rotate it

131
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,920
a tiny bit and we just click and now

132
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,930
it's rotated but we have until we see a

133
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,360
black line there so if we did rotation

134
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,970
we want to move this up to maybe like

135
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,310
you know a certain point because what's

136
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,040
happening is as we zoom out here it's

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,570
actually just rotating the whole thing

138
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,860
so we get some black appearing and so

139
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,090
depending on what you're doing rotation

140
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,950
is an option yeah that is the basically

141
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,540
that's the effect for transform there's

142
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,800
some different ones if we want to delete

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,510
this effect it goes back to normal

144
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,490
we've got letterbox we can just drag in

145
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,230
and that just has black bars on the top

146
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,480
and the bottom we can change the size of

147
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,340
it so if you want to create the kind

148
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020
like a cinematic effect have an ultra

149
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,010
wide screen it'll still export the video

150
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,630
1920 by 1080 or whatever your settings

151
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,060
are but it'll export it with a black box

152
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,670
like this it's like a letter boxing and

153
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,710
it just kind of helps draw your eyes to

154
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,670
like a certain portion of the video so

155
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,010
it's letterboxing an edge crop kind of

156
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,940
does the same thing I'll just show you a

157
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,530
few of these with edge crop if we drag

158
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,260
it in we can crop just a certain edge so

159
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,080
from the right we can crop in a little

160
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
bit so it cuts out part of the right and

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,150
then it also is centering the it Reese

162
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,970
enters the video but it cut out part so

163
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,930
that's another way we could do it if we

164
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,250
want to cut out those bikes over there

165
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,470
we can just do this so that cuts out

166
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,440
those bikes and but then it still shows

167
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,700
this portion of the video so we can

168
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,970
watch and see yeah what that looks like

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,020
and then again just like in the other

170
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,330
tutorials we can render this out save it

171
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,100
to a certain place on the computer I'm

172
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,140
not going to do it here but you get the

173
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,259
idea

174
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,879
and there's some of these with things

175
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,650
have key or keyframe well we'll talk

176
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,990
about keyframes and future tutorials but

177
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,430
what that lets us do is actually apply

178
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,240
if we wanted to do a good example might

179
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,279
be this letterboxing if we want to

180
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,050
keyframe the letterboxing which I don't

181
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,819
know if it even lets us do but it would

182
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,099
be animated so it would like slowly we

183
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:01,120
would see this part moving as the video

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,189
is also moving whereas right now

185
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,279
whatever we set it to it stays that way

186
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,770
that's how we could like zoom in on the

187
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,870
shot while the shot is actually playing

188
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,020
is by using keyframes and again check

189
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,610
out future tutorials where we learn how

190
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,529
to do that appreciate you watching this

191
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:18,789
