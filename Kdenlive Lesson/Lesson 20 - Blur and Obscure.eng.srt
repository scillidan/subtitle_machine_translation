00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,130
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,450
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,179
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,419
blurring out or obscuring a certain part

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,129
of a video if we're worried about

6
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,139
privacy you're protecting someone's

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,410
identity or some things identity so to

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,759
get started I'm gonna drag in a video

9
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,150
actually let's download okay I'm going

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,980
to my downloads folder and I'm gonna

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,429
bring in this video of a Mercedes

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,949
driving so this is a good example

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,040
because I'm gonna left click and drag it

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,230
down into my video project actually no I

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,270
could do that but look if I do this we

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,180
see this Clips about 30 seconds long so

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,010
I could shrink it down a couple ways I

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,510
can left-click here and just shrink it

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,310
down to the time I want so it's really

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,400
short or I can hit ctrl Z we learned we

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,050
can grab the razor tool and we can cut

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,970
this video to the length we want and

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,520
then just delete the other portion by

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,570
hitting the Delete key while it's

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,110
selected or I can control Z ctrl Z and

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,610
just delete this whole thing another way

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,750
I want to show you that you can bring

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,220
Clips in is by going to your clip

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,680
monitor and hitting play and then we can

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,150
use these things if you hover over it

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,440
says set zone in and set zone out so

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,420
what we can do where this playhead is if

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,240
I hit set zone in it creates a blue line

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,530
if I do zone out it creates a blue line

35
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,350
there and now we have we've selected a

36
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,210
zone here and if I left click and drag

37
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,790
this part of the clip it'll bring in

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,370
just that portion whereas if I grab this

39
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,750
whole thing up here it brings in this

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,870
whole long video so just this portion

41
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,080
now is just the portion that we did so

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,180
it's just a certain portion it's

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,909
wherever we press the the it is in and

44
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,180
out of when we were watching the clip so

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,560
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back here

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,180
to the clip monitor we're gonna go back

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,610
to the very beginning I'm gonna play and

48
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,620
this time I want in fact what I want to

49
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,270
do I want to go to the very beginning

50
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,920
and set the end point at the very

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,080
beginning and I want to click forward

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,909
here a little bit till this until it

53
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,010
changes to the next scene and I want to

54
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,600
have that be the out point so right here

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,519
this would be the out point then I'll

56
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,090
drag the video in on my video track 1

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,069
and I'll just zoom in

58
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,510
on the timeline so we can see it better

59
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,640
so it's just going to be a very quick

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,790
little video clip of a car driving

61
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,420
forward what I want to do let's obscure

62
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,939
this license plate maybe so it says C

63
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,739
Class right now but maybe it actually

64
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,750
really says the license plate number and

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,670
we want to show this video but we don't

66
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,260
want to so I want to give away the

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,939
privacy of like whoo you know I'm gonna

68
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,680
keep keep private who owns this vehicle

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,959
and what their license plate number is

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,840
so to do that we need to apply mmm

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,250
where's this thing even at it's under

72
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,829
distort no we want to do a what's it

73
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:56,459
called I kind of think of this guys I

74
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,560
said it in the introduction I said what

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,109
it was obscure yeah so we want to go

76
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:02,970
obscure oh it's under blurring hide okay

77
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,579
so under blurring hide we bring that

78
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:06,989
drop down and we have a couple different

79
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,510
things we can do we can apply blur if we

80
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,209
do blur just blurs the whole thing so we

81
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,970
can just blur like the whole video yeah

82
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,680
that would work they wouldn't be able to

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,440
read the license plate but then now so

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,109
we wanted we could do box blur I think

85
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,150
box blur gives us a box

86
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,010
oh no box blur is just a different type

87
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,470
of blur nevermind what we want to

88
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,079
actually do is go down to obscure and

89
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,930
left-click and drag that in so that

90
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,970
creates a box that it obscures just the

91
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,669
area where that is apt so we can move it

92
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,790
around to just that license plate and we

93
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,799
can actually resize it although this is

94
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,229
a video so it's moving and just because

95
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,849
we're setting it over the license plate

96
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,479
it's not gonna be tracked to it so what

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,609
I mean is if the video if later on the

98
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,440
car moves its location like it's doing

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,939
so you know we can see the size of the

100
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,889
license plate but we can't really read

101
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,419
it so we could just go to that we can go

102
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,819
forward and see what that looks like so

103
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,079
it looks pretty good there but by the

104
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,250
time it gets here it looks like it's

105
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,530
covering up the emblem a little bit so

106
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,909
we can just go back here and we can move

107
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,479
it down a little bit like this maybe and

108
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,790
maybe make it bigger just we'll put it

109
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,070
into a place where it's not looking to

110
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,320
where it's kind of a happy medium where

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,608
it's still gonna blur out the license

112
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,260
plate but not going to cut into that

113
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,800
emblem too much yeah that's probably

114
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,659
good so let's watch and see what this

115
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,169
looks like

116
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,039
play awesome so it's driving and that's

117
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,499
that box is just there it'd be cooler if

118
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,120
it was tracking to it maybe I'll make a

119
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,919
tell you the truth I haven't learned how

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,949
to do that in kdenlive yet so I'm

121
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,300
actually I think I did it several years

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,279
ago but I'll try and make a video

123
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,020
showing how to because we can track this

124
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,300
so that it moves along with a certain

125
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,279
portion of the video but yeah that's

126
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,840
basically it how to obscure if we want

127
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,460
to obscure out something else like this

128
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,889
like there's a person standing over here

129
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,169
we can resize this we can change right

130
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,219
now the width and the height they're

131
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:01,650
locked if we click here we can unlock

132
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,199
and have just the width be so we can

133
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,819
create this so this box is more like a

134
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,460
person shape and then we can change the

135
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,840
location of it to by just coming to the

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
scroll wheel and scrolling over if we

137
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,650
didn't want to move it around that way

138
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,569
and then yeah and then size 2 we can

139
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,650
change the size that way as well yeah

140
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,909
thanks for watching this video it's just

141
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,289
a quick one that's how you obscure

142
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,249
pretty simple in kdenlive and go ahead

143
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,740
and like comment subscribe ask me ask

144
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,870
some about some videos below if there's

145
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,430
a certain type of video you want me to

146
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,589
make go ahead and suggest that below and

147
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,270
I can see if I can make something like

148
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,580
that thanks for watching
