00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome back to another video editing tutorial using the free software Kdenlive.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this video, we're going to be adding audio to our video clip and then controlling the volume of that audio.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll do fade in, fade out, and I'll show you how to raise and lower the volume of the video at different points in the video.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So to get started, let's pull in.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In fact, I'm going to pull in a video that already has some audio.

6
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:35,424
Am I? No, I don't know if I do. Okay, yeah, I will. So I have this rain runoff, and I also have this audio file.

7
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:44,424
So this rain is just rain hitting against the window. It's actually the only video clip I have that has some audio with it.

8
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:48,424
We can play and listen to what this sounds like.

9
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:55,424
So if I want to separate out this audio, I can right click and go to split audio. I think we've done this in the past.

10
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:58,736
These are still tied together. If I want them to be untied, I can right click.

11
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:04,736
And go to Ungroup Clips. And now I can move them around independent of each other.

12
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:09,736
So maybe there's like a loud portion of this thunder. I'm not sure what this is. Let's listen to this.

13
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:16,736
So yeah, I can just see, you can see the waveform down there. It gets a little bit louder, a little bit bigger.

14
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:23,736
Let's scroll down and look at that. And so let's apply an audio effect to this.

15
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:27,736
So we go up here to our effects. And we have different audio things we can apply.

16
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:34,512
So we can like change the bass, we can do like equalization, add echo, all kinds of different things.

17
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,512
If you're wanting to change audio though, I would recommend not doing so much of this.

18
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:43,512
And I would recommend using Audacity. Check out some video tutorials on using Audacity.

19
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:48,512
So you can actually export this. In fact, if you drag and drop a video file into Audacity,

20
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:52,512
you can import just the audio portion of it, which is pretty cool.

21
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,512
And then you can bring that audio in separately. So I wouldn't worry about most of these.

22
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,448
Most of what you're going to want to do...

23
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:02,948
for audio in KdenLive, is just do these audio corrections.

24
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,448
So you can mute. You can do...

25
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:09,448
What I want to show you in this one is doing volume keyframable.

26
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:13,448
So we're going to add this volume over. And what it lets us do

27
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:16,448
is change the volume based on a certain point.

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,448
So we hit this...

29
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:21,448
If we go to this first frame, in the last video we kind of learned

30
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:25,448
a little bit about animation and keyframes in KdenLive.

31
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,032
So if you missed that one, this might be a little bit...

32
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:31,432
Hard to wrap your head around, but we have these different keyframes.

33
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:36,032
So at a certain point, maybe like this far into the video, at this point,

34
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,232
we want to click this plus sign and add a keyframe here.

35
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:44,432
And then we can change the volume between from this point to this point.

36
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,432
We can have the volume fade up, for example.

37
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,232
So we can have it be very soft.

38
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:54,832
Where's that?

39
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,832
So we have it start like basically none.

40
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,396
And then we can have it go louder by the time it gets to this point.

41
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:05,936
And the cool thing I like about this is we don't have to just control the volume here even though we can.

42
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,936
But look what's happening down here. We can see these different points.

43
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:16,936
And so we can actually change the volume and we can move that key frame around just by changing it on here.

44
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:21,936
So we can say get loud here and if we double click on there we can add another key frame in.

45
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,936
And we can say then get soft here for a little bit.

46
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:28,928
And then we can double click and say get really loud right here.

47
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:32,768
And we can just kind of change the volume of this and then we can be like and by the very

48
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:35,648
end drop off and be quiet again.

49
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:40,888
So what we've done we've set different volumes for different points of this video.

50
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,128
So now we'll play it and see.

51
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:48,048
So it starts out kind of soft.

52
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,048
Really loud.

53
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:51,928
And then it gets softer again.

54
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:57,976
So that's one way that we can do the volume. There's also some simple things like fade.

55
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:02,976
If we just apply a fade in, it'll just do like a fade in on the audio.

56
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,976
We can do a fade out on the audio.

57
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:12,976
But really, the really powerful one is this volume key frameable, which lets you change the volume.

58
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:17,976
If you have a podcast, for example, you might have some introduction music on your podcast.

59
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,976
And then you want to lower the volume down while you're talking.

60
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:25,984
Like this. And then towards the end, you raise up the volume again.

61
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:32,984
You know, so it might look something like this if you're doing a podcast loud and then soft during the talking and then loud again at the end.

62
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:38,704
Anyway, that's just kind of what I wanted to show you as far as how to change volume and

63
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:43,864
yeah, adjust sound and music within CadenLive. Go ahead and play with a lot of these though.

64
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:50,984
You've got gain. If we delete this, right, we can apply gain and just change the volume like for the whole thing.

65
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,912
From start to finish, it doesn't like fade at all.

66
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:58,312
We can do like, I don't know, normalize audio channels,

67
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:02,312
like pan between left and right and different things.

68
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,312
So yeah, play with some of those different audio,

69
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:06,312
these audio effects and get familiar with them

70
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:09,312
and it's going to help you create better video projects in the future.

71
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:12,312
Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next video.
