00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,250
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,660
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,509
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,879
learning about the copy and paste

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,129
functions and we're going to be playing

6
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,939
with some basic video and audio effects

7
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:19,109
so to get started we're gonna grab a

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,210
video clip if you're following along you

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,160
may have downloaded some from like

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,039
pixabay or from free sound some audio

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,810
files so we already have a few

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,490
downloaded that we're gonna be using but

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,749
if you don't have some go ahead and grab

14
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,759
some from there some nice free video

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,850
clips you can use we're going to go to

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,650
my downloads folder I'm going to drag in

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,050
just a few we have this one I'll drag in

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,660
this video this is the video of a person

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,480
riding their bike so we'd click play

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,060
it's just bike riding back and forth and

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,950
back and forth and maybe we want to

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,410
create a cool kind of effect where this

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,240
person like maybe we'll create like this

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,040
kind of effect where they we want to

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,860
just keep writing like looping back so

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,620
we'll we'll drag this video in and we're

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,890
gonna cut it and just copy that portion

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,240
of the video and play it over and over

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,340
again maybe four or five times sometimes

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,630
just to get its effect in like a music

31
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,580
video or more or less we're just

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,280
learning how to use the copy and paste

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,380
tool and how to work around our timeline

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,360
so like we always do we first get in I

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,710
like to when I'm working with a short

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,720
clip like this I can zoom in a little

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,970
bit so I can see a little bit more of

38
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,350
that clip and what's going on with it

39
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,870
one more notch yeah that's good and so

40
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,330
there's no audio with this video clip at

41
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,909
all but we'll add an audio after so

42
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,350
let's just play this and see what it

43
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,000
looks like so I'm just going to I'm only

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,890
gonna use that first part of it if I

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,450
left click and drag while I'm on this

46
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,670
little white triangle like it's the

47
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,030
playhead I can move around and see frame

48
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,040
by frame exactly what we're I want to be

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,240
so maybe I want to end this video when

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,880
he goes out of there so right there I'm

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,680
going to click on my razor tool I'll

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,330
just click right here on the playhead

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,210
and then I'll click on my selection tool

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,128
and I'll left click select the rest of

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,598
the video and just hit the Delete key on

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,659
the keyboard now we can zoom in and see

57
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,840
just this

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,150
little short clip it's if we look at the

59
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,220
top we can see how long it is it looks

60
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,530
like it's a little over it's not just

61
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,959
one second long see yeah it's about a

62
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,970
one-second long clip if we want to watch

63
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,440
this in Reverse by the way on our

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,790
project monitor we can just hit the

65
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,830
reverse and we'll play the whole thing

66
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,480
in Reverse so we can play it and forward

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
and play it in Reverse that's sort of

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,569
how that works alright so what I want to

69
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,099
do I want to find a nice good clip so

70
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,660
I'll left-click and it's kind of scroll

71
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,480
maybe for this part here about when he's

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,390
at this like telephone pole maybe from

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,569
there so this is where I want to start

74
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,459
I'm gonna I want to cut the clip here

75
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,319
first of all so I get my razor tool

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
again and then I'll cut right there and

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,810
you see it kind of snaps it this razor

78
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,150
tool is kind of moving in like little

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,120
increments is not completely fluid and

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,470
that's because we have a not sure where

81
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,290
snapping is but we have snapping turned

82
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,690
on it's an option right here so we have

83
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,329
snap so if we unclick this then we can

84
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,250
kind of go like a lot more granular

85
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,190
granularly but with snapping on it makes

86
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,750
it so that we when we hover over our

87
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,299
playhead for example will cut exactly

88
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,769
right where I playhead is which is kind

89
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,079
of nice for us in this case now I want

90
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,579
to go back to my selection tool I'll

91
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,540
drag forward to a couple maybe till he

92
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,519
gets to this next to pull this next kind

93
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,620
of or sign whatever that is and I'm

94
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,130
going to cut again there so what I've

95
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,780
done I've actually cut so now I have

96
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,180
three I've turned this one clip into

97
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,810
three clips

98
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,370
well we already shortened it quite a bit

99
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,919
and now we have one two three and we can

100
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,480
use these different video tracks if we

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,829
want to just to kind of keep things

102
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,380
clean for us so I'll drag this part up

103
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,030
to here and maybe this part I'll drag up

104
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,950
to this third one I mean I guess I

105
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,299
shouldn't say it makes it clean because

106
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,669
it's kind of a matter of preference but

107
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,919
at least it helps us visually step right

108
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,209
out okay we have these three different

109
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,459
tracks and then if we play this if we

110
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,720
play it'll actually play just right

111
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,190
normally we won't see anything between

112
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,260
we won't see any difference between

113
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,860
those I think there's no there's no I

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,020
like blinking or anything when it goes

115
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,370
from one video clip to the next

116
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,169
just seamlessly goes which is pretty

117
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,360
cool all right we want to copy this one

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,680
so to do that we can do a couple

119
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,660
different things we can right-click on

120
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,229
it and go to copy for one and then we

121
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,479
can just right click and go to paste and

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,919
whatever track we right-click and paste

123
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,710
it in it'll go into that track I think

124
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,000
we can even put it in an audio track if

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,449
we want to

126
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,639
yeah it'll go in an audio track I don't

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,840
know if you're play in an audio track I

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,790
don't think it will but now I just

129
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,100
pasted a whole bunch of these you see so

130
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm left clicking around and dragging

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,210
them all so this is the end part of the

132
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,220
video so we want it to be more over here

133
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,650
now and then you see it went black

134
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,120
because our playhead is sitting right

135
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,520
here so if we want to see something we

136
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,930
can just remove our playhead over to it

137
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,380
a certain piece of video and then we'll

138
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,199
drag all five it to five yeah we'll drag

139
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,260
all five of these end to end to end to

140
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,360
end and then what that's going to do and

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,650
then we'll put this into the end of that

142
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,150
one and see since we have snap on it

143
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,789
goes perfectly it kind of snaps right to

144
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,130
where it's supposed to be and now let's

145
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,240
see what this looks like if we hit play

146
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,639
so it almost looks like a glitch it's

147
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,050
just like going over and over and over

148
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,020
again all right

149
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,539
that's kind of cool so we did copy where

150
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:41,740
if we just want to cut though what if we

151
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,349
wanted to cut maybe we want to start the

152
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,590
video with that with that portion so one

153
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,530
thing that is kind of cool if I want to

154
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,479
move maybe we want to move we want to

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,360
start the this end part of the video we

156
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,740
want that to be at the beginning and

157
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,050
want the beginning to be at the end but

158
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,520
instead of dragging and moving them like

159
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,470
that we will let's use our cut function

160
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,750
so we'll select we'll right-click on the

161
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,580
the image we want to cut and we go down

162
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,310
to we cut the clip what that's gonna do

163
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,590
it stays right there for now but if we

164
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,960
want to paste it we right-click I think

165
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,550
it'll go the same let's paste it down

166
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,680
here right here where this at the

167
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,410
playhead I think it'll do that paste so

168
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,280
now it paste it and what did it paste

169
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,220
oh I thought we have so we want to

170
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,599
right-click you know what did I cut it

171
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,660
clipped Oh clip

172
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,100
project bin so we can send it up to our

173
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,350
project bin too if we want to but I

174
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,640
don't think it cut it the way I wanted

175
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,560
it to but that's good to know too so if

176
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,180
we wanted to send let's say we want to

177
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,030
send just this portion of the bike I'm

178
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,370
changing my mind now instead of copying

179
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,170
this we want to just send it up into our

180
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,960
project bin we can go clip in project

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,610
bin and then it clips it right here so

182
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,860
in our project monitor it moves this

183
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,620
little blue there's this little portion

184
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,840
that's blue now if we drag and drop this

185
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,600
actual video in it'll be just that

186
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,750
portion of the video and I didn't really

187
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,490
get into that and I'll do that but if we

188
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,290
want to move this now whatever portion

189
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,110
we drag it'll be that much longer so if

190
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,220
you don't want to just drag the whole

191
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,830
file in you can click and drag just the

192
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,760
portion that you've clipped in and out

193
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,450
we're getting a little bit into the

194
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,100
weeds here like and I'm not

195
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,780
accomplishing exactly what I'm wanting

196
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,500
to show in this video just yet but let's

197
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,510
go ahead and add hopefully I haven't

198
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,950
confused you let's go ahead and add an

199
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,490
audio track to this so I'll bring in an

200
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,080
audio file we don't have any yet this is

201
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,860
the music we used in our last tutorial

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,420
so we'll collect click and drag it down

203
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,270
and put it right here and then we'll go

204
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,620
to the beginning of this and let play

205
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,809
[Music]

206
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,650
she is going really fast because that's

207
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,360
where zoomed in so far so we can zoom

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,010
out a little bit and kind of see

209
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,630
differently now our video clips might be

210
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,310
harder to click on but at least we can

211
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,850
see the whole extent of the audio drag

212
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,070
let's come here to the last the end and

213
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,780
let's cut our audio so we go to our

214
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,790
razor tool just go down here and

215
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,920
left-click now we have two separate

216
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,660
audio we'll go back to our selection we

217
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,820
have an audio track here an audio track

218
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,430
here we could move this over here it's

219
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,410
gonna sound bad but it's going to be two

220
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,940
different parts of audio playing over

221
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,480
top of each other

222
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,130
okay let's just keep it it actually kind

223
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,320
of goes with our glitchyness so let's

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,789
come over here to the end of the video

225
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,700
again hit the x key on the keyboard or

226
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,890
click on the razor tool and then left

227
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,560
click to cut hit the S key on the

228
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,270
keyboard to go back to selection mode

229
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,580
and then just delete this last part of

230
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,340
the audio now I can zoom in here and

231
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,500
we'll see perfect so this is our video

232
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,090
clip we see we're using three different

233
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,400
video tracks we don't really need to we

234
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,710
have seven total different video clips

235
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,900
that we could actually move around and

236
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,360
change let's say maybe we want to have a

237
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,100
little bit of black space in between

238
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,780
each of these we can do that we need to

239
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,120
separate this out we can actually drag

240
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,250
and put in a little bit of black space

241
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,250
between each one of these what that's

242
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,160
going to do is create this effect of a

243
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,990
little bit of black in between each one

244
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,620
so not really in effect and then if we

245
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,450
want we can drag this audio out and this

246
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,830
is one thing I really wanted to show we

247
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,300
can do this with up with audio clips and

248
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,360
video once it's been cut if we scroll to

249
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,850
the end we can actually resize this

250
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,740
audio clip now to go to the end of our

251
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,710
video project and it'll just grab the

252
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,270
next part of the audio you see we have

253
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,200
this like dip here in audio at the end

254
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,120
that's what it sounds like this last one

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,580
we can left-click and we can drag and

256
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,260
you see it's not actually moving the

257
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,080
audio it's just getting us more audio so

258
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,090
it's kind of cutting it down to here and

259
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,630
we can also extend it further again that

260
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,120
only works to the extent of the audio

261
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,250
file so we can't go we can't we couldn't

262
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,410
go further past to the end of the audio

263
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,720
file and we couldn't pull it from the

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,250
beginning further than the beginning of

265
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,530
the audio file if that makes sense but

266
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,000
the same thing works with a video too so

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
this ends right here if we look at where

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,790
this ends it has him going out but we

269
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,010
since we cut this video clip we could

270
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,800
left-click and drag and see what's past

271
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,140
that part of the video and see what

272
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,150
happens so he starts writing in that way

273
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,820
but we cut that so we could do it the

274
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,740
way we did we can grab the razor tool

275
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,170
and cut it again and delete this part of

276
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,880
the video or if I hit control

277
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,210
easy to undo that we can actually just

278
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,190
hover to the move our mouse to the end

279
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,860
and left-click and shrink that down a

280
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,780
little bit and it accomplishes the same

281
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,800
thing so that's pretty cool then also I

282
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,700
think that's all we're going to do I

283
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,560
said we're gonna add in this video is

284
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,630
getting too long so in the next video is

285
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,790
when we're going to be doing adding in

286
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,370
video and audio effects and I'm going to

287
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,110
keep all this video up so just join the

288
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,150
next tutorial we want to reset up at

289
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,680
anything we'll leave it exactly how it

290
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
is now and we'll just add in some video

291
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,970
effects so thanks for watching catch you

292
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,510
in the next video
