1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,259
foreign

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,879
we'll be using masking with Kaden live

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,580
to have some text revealed from behind

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,460
an object in our video

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,900
we can do this a couple different ways

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,759
so here's another example of a car

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,859
revealing the text but for this one

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,240
we're going to be doing this tree video

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,000
clip we'll drag it down to the timeline

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,460
and this is just a camera moving panning

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,220
past a tree and we want our text to be

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,199
behind the tree and then show up as we

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,599
kind of come around it so we'll go to to

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,759
create a title clip

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,559
and we could really reveal any object

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,420
but in this case it's text so we'll

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,219
create a title clip which type the word

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
forest and then we'll make sure that

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,180
this title clip is the same length as

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
our video clip or at least

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,660
the portion that we want to be revealed

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,559
at

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,180
and we can transform this text to make

24
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,059
it a little bit larger if we want to

25
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,739
and then go open the search bar here and

26
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,899
type in mask under effects and we'll

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,180
drag this rotoscoping mask over top of

28
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,800
the text clip

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,899
and so what this lets us do is draw a

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,359
mask on top of this text clip and it

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,880
also create a key frame so the first

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,740
point that we draw we'll get to the

33
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,060
point right where the text is about to

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,799
come out of the tree and we'll just draw

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,340
sort of a box around the text

36
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,960
and then we'll change the alpha

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,479
operation to subtract and then we can go

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
to the point where we think the text is

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
going to be completely revealed

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
and notice we don't see anything until

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,220
we adjust the mask and then by adjusting

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,020
this anything outside of it will be

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
visible since we did the subtract and

44
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,220
anything inside of it will be not

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,780
visible

46
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,520
and then we can just come over here on

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,400
the timeline and it created a keyframe

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,720
for us automatically but it wasn't

49
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,119
exactly perfect and so we can kind of go

50
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,880
along and adjust this mask through over

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,380
the timeline and every time I make an

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,479
adjustment it'll create a keyframe

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,340
between the last point that we made an

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,720
adjustment and the next point we're

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,579
making an adjustment and it'll sort of

56
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,560
estimate where it thinks that it's not

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,299
really looking at where the tree is it's

58
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,680
just looking at the difference between

59
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,380
where we moved it's just using keyframes

60
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,899
to adjust that mask in between those

61
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,820
points so notice down in the timeline

62
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,740
different keyframes are being created

63
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,378
these red ones are the active ones and

64
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,780
also on the effects panel you can see

65
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,640
the keyframes too

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,379
and with this clip it's fairly easy

67
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,120
because it's moving at a constant speed

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
so the masking isn't incredibly

69
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,879
difficult

70
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,319
if you want to follow along with this

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,000
exact video clip you can find a download

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
link for it in the video description

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,560
once you get to the point where you feel

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,180
like the masking is done pretty well you

75
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,220
can go ahead and play your video

76
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,780
I hope this video has made it a little

77
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,180
more clear about how to use the masking

78
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,120
to reveal objects in Caden live if you

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,200
have any questions or comments please

80
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
leave them below and look forward to

81
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,840
catching you in the next video
