00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,250
welcome back to another kiddin live

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,620
video editing tutorial in the last video

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,240
we looked at using the obscure effect to

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
kind of obscure out a license plate but

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,220
the problem was when we moved forward in

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,580
our video that would that box would kind

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,140
of just stay in the same place and it

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,000
was going up and like see it would have

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,830
obscuring part of the Mercedes symbol

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,929
there and so this box just sort of

11
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,599
stayed wherever we put it and so now I'm

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,769
going to show you how to have that box

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,840
move and kind of track along with a

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,060
certain object in the video in theory so

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,820
I will say this tool is not perfect by

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,740
any means but it's actually called Auto

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,990
mask under blur and hide so we'll drag

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,720
it in and what the auto mask will do you

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,310
choose a point in the video that you

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,770
think is a good reference point and you

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,530
just resize this box so it looks very

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,560
similar to the obscure so we'll just set

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,730
this to a point that we want to kind of

24
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,800
maybe like right here so we'll set it to

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,510
that license plate and then we actually

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,860
have this analyze button we click

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,200
analyze and it takes just a second it

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,170
analyzes kind of all the pixels within

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,510
that box and it does its best to try and

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,520
follow them throughout so now if we go

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,860
forward it should so that box is still

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,510
moving up but look it's not obscuring

33
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,700
the Mercedes symbol if we click off so

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,950
that red box is no longer selected now

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,710
we see it's following along as best it

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,600
can with that license plate and it

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
doesn't now it tracks over to the right

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,380
so it kind of messed up there but at

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,670
least there's no it's not going up and

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,530
getting that Mercedes symbol like it was

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,770
doing last time we can fix that I think

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,940
by just making this box a little bit

43
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,030
bigger then we were hit analyze and I

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,979
think that should be good now and we'll

45
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,990
just merge the data together so let's

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,820
see what it does now so that's better

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,060
and so now we have it going start from

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,540
the beginning it kind of you know

49
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,130
obscures that license plate and it

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,770
doesn't get up and cover up the Mercedes

51
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,430
symbol though so this is sort of a

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,930
working example to tell you the truth I

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,758
tried to get lots of other video footage

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,609
like if we go later on this video here

55
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:13,439
I'll delete this now I couldn't get it

56
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,100
to even try

57
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,920
to this part so it's not even it's not

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,940
super great yet but it is an option that

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,620
might just work for you as long as your

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,180
subject or the thing you're trying to

61
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,640
obscure is not moving too much you might

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,590
have success but don't if you don't get

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,850
frustrated if you can't get it to work

64
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,550
because it's a it's not a very good

65
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,560
tracking tool if you want to do more

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,820
advanced tracking like this I would

67
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,710
recommend using a free software like

68
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,510
Natron you can check out my other

69
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,490
tutorials in fact I'll make a tutorial

70
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,310
in there about how to do obscure and

71
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,130
actually track really well to obscure an

72
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,200
object hopefully you found this kind of

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,190
informative though appreciate you

74
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,570
watching and I'll see you in the next

75
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,810
