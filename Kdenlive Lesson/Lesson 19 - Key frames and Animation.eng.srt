00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,190
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,690
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,650
kdenlive

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,019
in our last video we use this butterfly

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,589
and this image of this coastline to

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,139
create to demonstrate the chroma key

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,810
green screen effect we're gonna repeat

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,130
that in this one because we're gonna be

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,960
going over animation and showing how to

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,660
actually move this butterfly across the

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,439
screen and animate in kdenlive so first

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,089
of all we're going to reapply the chroma

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,790
key we find the chroma key under alpha

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,710
manipulation we'll just drag it on top

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,780
of the butterfly and then we click here

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,660
on this little drop and select our color

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,170
and that will should change everything

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,820
that's when we go in here yeah so that

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,870
changes everything so that we can

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,890
actually see now the background so now

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,480
we can see our background the butterfly

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,760
is kind of flying here we can kind of

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,080
scroll through and see what this looks

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,230
like but the butterfly is staying there

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,620
and it's not moving and so we might want

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,180
to adjust the size of it too or change

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,349
some different things so what we can do

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,050
let's erase all this go back to our

29
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,550
effects and we'll go to crop and

30
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,350
transform and then we'll get a transform

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,370
so not all effects allow for animation

32
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,920
but transform is one that does and if

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,570
ever you have you pull in an effect and

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,970
it has this little bar the top with with

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,890
a couple triangles you know that you can

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,720
perform you can do animation or you can

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
set keyframes and have that effect

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,600
applied differently at different points

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,990
of the clip so what we're gonna do we

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,130
have these different buttons here right

41
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,940
now this triangle if we notice moves

42
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,810
according to where we're at on our

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,820
timeline so if we move our timeline

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,260
towards the end of the video this

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,750
triangle is towards the end and we can

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,729
also move the triangle here on the

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,580
timeline I mean up here and it'll move

48
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,159
the playhead on our timeline so these

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,990
are tied together if we hit this

50
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,510
triangle with the line at the start of

51
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,299
it it goes to the first frame of our

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,850
video clip and if we go to the click

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,590
this it goes to the last frame of our

54
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,038
video clip and so we notice at the first

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,749
frame there is if we come here to the

56
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:11,310
middle and look there's a red triangle

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,740
at the start that's our key

58
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,470
rame so we have a keyframe starting at

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,860
the beginning to make this butterfly

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,590
animate or move we need to set at least

61
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,570
one more keyframe and a good place to do

62
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,520
it just for starting is to set it at the

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,620
end of the video clip so let's hit this

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,450
arrow to go to the end of the video clip

65
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,800
make sure the playhead is at the end of

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,690
our video and then we'll hit the plus

67
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,020
sign and that adds a keyframe so now I

68
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,490
have a red triangle at the end it's kind

69
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,500
of hard to see and I have a triangle at

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,600
the beginning so that's how we know we

71
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
have two keyframes then anything that

72
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,500
any way that we change this butterfly

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,110
the size of it or the location of it any

74
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,000
of these settings that we change below

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,630
here it will it will transition I guess

76
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,270
you can say between what was happening

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,740
at the first keyframe and what's

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,320
happening at the last keyframe so let's

79
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
go back to our first keyframe we'll see

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,650
it looks like this okay so it's this

81
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,780
size maybe we want at our first keyframe

82
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,410
let's resize it down and let's have the

83
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,480
butterfly be over here towards the left

84
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,090
a little bit lower about that size and

85
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,250
then we see there's a line here so it's

86
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,550
showing us where it's going by the last

87
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,590
keyframe so let's go to the last

88
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,170
keyframe and see okay so it's going to

89
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,470
be this size and it's going to be at

90
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,800
this position so we can resize that too

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,280
and move it and maybe we want it even

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,640
smaller like forward so now it's going

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,250
to be it's going to go from this first

94
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,090
keyframe to this last keyframe over the

95
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,240
duration of it's about only one second

96
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,420
is all of our all that our video clip is

97
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,740
so now we can just come and play that

98
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,210
and see what that will look like so we

99
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,970
go back to the beginning hit play and we

100
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,590
see our butterfly is kind of flying

101
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,810
along that path it happened really short

102
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,390
but I can go drag along and show you so

103
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,920
it's this is just what's happening the

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,990
butterfly is flying the backgrounds

105
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,390
moving we've created an animated little

106
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,840
butterfly here and we don't have to just

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,820
do if we go back in click on this track

108
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,370
and go to the effects for the transform

109
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,260
as long as we're on our keyframe if

110
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,150
we're in the middle look we have we

111
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,590
can't control any of these we can't

112
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,330
change the size or anything

113
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,250
because we're not on a keyframe so you

114
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,659
have to always be on a keyframe so you

115
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,250
can click on this frame or you can use

116
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,370
these start and end and if we wanted it

117
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,599
to do something different we can go to

118
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,819
the middle and we can add a keyframe in

119
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,650
the middle and we can have it do

120
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,780
something like this like fly it up and

121
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,650
then over and so now if we do that look

122
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,129
what will happen it'll fly it'll go up

123
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,900
and follow this sort of path we've set

124
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,740
for it and then it'll go over so we've

125
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,479
created yeah an animation they were

126
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,310
doing that let's go back to the very

127
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,560
first keyframe and we can also change

128
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,050
some different things what do we do we

129
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,389
did scale so one other thing we can

130
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,819
change is rotation so we can rotate this

131
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,460
butterfly a little bit as it's flying we

132
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,469
can have it rotate so it starts like

133
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,750
this maybe it's gonna fly it with want

134
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,659
to fly it up we can have it I don't want

135
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,580
to be too extreme but then that'll

136
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,139
change the rotation and as it's going

137
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,169
it's gonna rotate around so we can

138
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,169
change rotation and scale and different

139
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,440
different properties that way so I would

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,490
recommend you play with this if you

141
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,900
didn't watch the last video go ahead and

142
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,069
watch it because I show where to

143
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,110
download this green screen butterfly

144
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,060
it's actually a pretty good object for

145
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,370
learning how to get started in animating

146
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,259
in kdenlive what else and then maybe

147
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,120
watch some other videos on actually how

148
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,069
keyframing and how video works if you're

149
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,199
kind of getting confused and it's not

150
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,460
working well just make sure you always

151
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,039
have to add in this keyframe and you

152
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,409
can't add it where an existing keyframe

153
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,009
is or you won't have any movement what

154
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,449
else okay so you can also change the

155
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,330
opacity which doesn't really help us in

156
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,969
this case but if by this keyframe if you

157
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,060
want the opacity to be down like at 32%

158
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,550
it changes so that this is kind of like

159
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,699
not very bright not very bright it's not

160
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,889
it's transparent and so now if we do

161
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,770
that it starts out with full all the

162
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,810
full colors and then by the time it gets

163
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,169
to that keyframe it's changed to not to

164
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,120
like almost see-through and then it

165
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,060
becomes light again so we wouldn't want

166
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,560
to do that in this case but sometimes

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,060
you want I just want to show you that

168
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,639
opacity is also keyframe Abul so you can

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,060
have an object fade

170
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,610
in as part of the animation yeah so

171
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,870
that's it so watch for some of these

172
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,700
other ones have you can keyframe the

173
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,350
audio some of these audio things on

174
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,380
under audio Corrections there's this

175
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,840
volume that's keyframe Abul so you can

176
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
set a keyframe with your audio too

177
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,160
sometimes so maybe you want to have it

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,530
start out kind of soft and then at a

179
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,300
certain portion of the video you want to

180
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,280
have it be loud again you can use the

181
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,220
keyframe on audio to do that too so go

182
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,450

183
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,070
tutorial over again if you need to and

184
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,139
follow the steps that I did and just get

185
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,270

a lot of cool stuff with animation video

187

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,610
transitions basically using animation

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,000
