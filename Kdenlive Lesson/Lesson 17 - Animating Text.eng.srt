00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,190
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,450
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,440
kdenlive

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,990
in this video we're going to be learning

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,959
how to animate objects will basically

6
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:16,079
animate text on the screen and so in the

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,080
last video we learned how to create a

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,750
title screen so in this video we're

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,710
gonna do the same thing we're gonna

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,359
click on this little triangle here this

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,849
drop down and go to add title clip and

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,460
we're presented with this box here and

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,800
so now we're gonna do a title again so

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,960
we'll say this is TJ free and then and

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,550
if you remember from the last video I

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,800
made some changes so it remembers I mean

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,220
it'll keep the same style we did from

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,750
last time so now that's why it's red

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,850
with a green background and we can

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,220
either come in here and we can zoom in

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,760
on the object or we can just change the

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,350
font size and we can change what the

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,300
actual font is I'm gonna change this so

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,620
that it's not green we'll do maybe a

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,840
blue border and we can change the

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,739
outline and make that a little bit

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,900
thicker if we want as well and then

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,670
we'll change the color in the middle to

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,700
white so now what's gonna look like this

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
and actually against a black background

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,490
if we come down here and click show

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,720
background this is what it'll actually

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,060
look like because we're creating a title

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,890
clip and there would have no video in

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,510
our in our project yet we just have this

36
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,170
text is all so we can hit OK and then we

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,760
have our title clip still nothing in our

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,340
project but we can left-click bring it

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,250
down to video track 1 and we'll zoom in

40
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,460
a little bit on the timeline and if we

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,190
play this we'll see it just plays this

42
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,909
is TJ free that's all it does and then

43
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,880
it the video ends so we can actually

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,950
animate this and create it so it either

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,200
maybe we want to come in from the bottom

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,479
you could create ending credits this way

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,220
or you can have it slide in from the

48
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,310
left or like to zoom in closer kdenlive

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,690
it's a little bit interesting the way

50
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,070
that it accomplishes this but we'll take

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,990
a look and I'll show you how it works so

52
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,369
come back up here to our title clip if

53
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,600
you want to edit this text or anything

54
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,818
we just double click and it brings us

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,400
back into our double click over on this

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,230
left hand side brings us back into this

57
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,890
edit box

58
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,739
so we can double-click and we can change

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,730
if you wanted to add like two

60
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,140
exclamation points to the end we can do

61
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,989
that or even three and maybe we want to

62
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,819
make we want this to be more centered so

63
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,440
we click on it when we have our

64
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,450
selection tool selected and then we just

65
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,420
Center it like this analysis exactly in

66
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,680
the center of the of the viewer what are

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,780
the things do we have up here we're not

68
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,220
gonna do that right now but we can we

69
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,709
could add a rectangle so now we want to

70
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,709
go to this tab here for animation so we

71
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,140
click on the animation tab and we have a

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,410
two buttons edit start and edit end so

73
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,560
if we click Edit start we see everything

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,390
turns a little bit a shade of green and

75
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,030
then we have this hand we can left-click

76
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,519
and drag and it moves around this this

77
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,830
box that says start on it there's

78
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,720
another box that says end on it but

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,010
right now we're on edit start so we're

80
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,080
only controlling the start box and I'm

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,780
gonna zoom out just a little bit if we

82
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,400
come down here we can zoom out and see

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,980
what we're seeing so you can imagine

84
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,190
this start box is actually what it's

85
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,650
like a camera kind of a camera angle or

86
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,350
a camera view so that if we have it

87
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,260
start right here this is what the camera

88
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,459
is going to look at starting and since

89
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,109
our start and our end we're in the same

90
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,430
place no animation was taking place but

91
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,829
if we move it down here we can move it

92
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,500
all the way off the screen the camera

93
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,299
will start looking at just a bunch of

94
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,700
black and actually everything is black

95
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,680
if we click this show background it'll

96
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,940
start here looking at a bunch of black

97
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,480
and then it'll end here with teeth this

98
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,700
is TJ free text in the middle of the

99
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,100
screen that makes sense so I'm going to

100
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,239
leave it like this for now and it's

101
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,069
going to take the duration is five

102
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,470
seconds so over five seconds it's going

103
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,329
to zoom up it's going to move up and

104
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,109
kind of create the effect of this text

105
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,250
falling out of the top of the screen

106
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,250
let's click OK and we'll see how that's

107
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:16,690
gonna work so we see this is TJ free and

108
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,108
there it is so at any point in the video

109
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,870
we can see now this text is moving we

110
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,220
can go back in and edit that if we want

111
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,539
to maybe we didn't like that look so

112
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,620
much about the animation tab

113
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,150
we can click Edit end or we can click

114
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,280
Edit start and we can move the start one

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,590
and have it be a little bit closer like

116
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,750
this because there's a lot of empty

117
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,880
space waiting for it to fall so we have

118
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,550
it be waiting waiting right above like

119
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,860
just barely ready to come in and we can

120
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,380
edit the end and for the end we can do

121
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,699
the same thing we can move it up here we

122
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,380
can just kind of here to see what's

123
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,900
going on so now the end is going to be

124
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,330
now it's going to end with it completely

125
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,919
off the screen the ending screen is

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,479
going to look like this everything in

127
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,870
red so by the time the video ends this

128
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,410
t.j free will be off the screen already

129
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,340
hopefully this is making sense it's kind

130
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,020
of hard to understand at first but it

131
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,010
once you play with a little bit you'll

132
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,500
you'll see what it's doing so now we're

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,720
playing it's gonna come here and keep

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,330
going and at by the time the clip ends

135
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,550
it's off the screen again so that's how

136
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,169
you can create an effect of text kind of

137
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,160
falling off the screen like this we can

138
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,840
go back in if we want maybe we want to

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,380
do a horizontal so we'd come here we go

140
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,910
to edit start which is down here now

141
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,960
let's zoom out a little bit let's have

142
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,940
it let's have our start to be over here

143
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,280
towards the left and then click on edit

144
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,380
end and let's have our end be over here

145
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,340
towards the right so now it'll start the

146
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,960
camera will start looking here and all

147
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,669
this blackness we can click show

148
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,169
background and see exactly what it'll

149
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:51,710
look like

150
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,470
and then it'll end it'll transition from

151
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,820
here over to here over a period of 5

152
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,250
seconds let's click OK and see how that

153
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,000
works go back to the start I'll play it

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,690
and then we see a that since the camera

155
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,580
is moving but we're just still seeing

156
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,099
this one view angle what it's creating

157
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,789
this effect of the text moving across

158
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:22,370
the screen something else we can do if

159
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,810
we want to create an animation of the

160
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,030
text starting really small and then

161
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,669
becoming large again we have to do it

162
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,550
all in this frame of reference like of

163
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,740
the size of this box so look we can

164
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,070
resize this down to 50% and then this

165
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,330
box becomes really small

166
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,080
so we can have it kind of actually let's

167
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,970
make our n bot let's make this in 200%

168
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,909
so let's zoom out and see so by the time

169
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,099
it ends its going to be looking at here

170
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,490
and then by the time when it starts I'm

171
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,139
sorry that was to start and then we'll

172
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,849
resize it by time it ends it'll be

173
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,190
zoomed in really close to the text so

174
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,169
it's gonna start really big like this

175
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,159
and it's gonna end really really tight

176
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,680
in like this so let's see if this

177
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,909
creates this kind of look we're going

178
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:14,479
for

179
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,930
Oh sure enough so it starts to camp

180
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,090
really far away and then over a period

181
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,219
of 5 seconds it gets very very very

182
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,599
close to this text pretty cool huh

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,599
so that is using the again to get that

184
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,690
we just added a title clip and there are

185
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,979
some templates and you can create your

186
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,900
own templates you can there are some

187
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,389
templates like this one that's a simple

188
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,949
scroll kdenlive and if we do that one

189
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,780
I'll just delete this clip so this

190
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,690
template just creates whatever text we

191
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,740
type in and it just Scrolls from top to

192
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,750
bottom just like that so if you want to

193
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,949
use a template and if you want to create

194
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,630
your own title clip and then we could

195
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,669
turn this one into a template not sure

196
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,319
how how we actually make it a template

197
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,110
but I'm pretty sure we can add this into

198
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,639
a template so now I'm off to figure it

199
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,620
out and show you but I appreciate you

200
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,879
watching this video that's hopefully

201
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,650
giving you some ideas of how you can

202
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,219
animate at least text and really what we

203
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,169
can end up doing it doesn't have to be

204
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,029
just text so with there was this box for

205
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,190
drawing a shape we can draw a shape and

206
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,259
then that'll actually animate on there

207
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,909
as well it'll do whatever everything

208
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,319
else was doing oh so if we drag this in

209
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,870
then anything on that canvas anything

210
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,669
that we were viewing will also become

211
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,958
animated or will be zooming in on that

212
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,909
as well so you can't animate individual

213
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,039
objects at least not this using this

214
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,829
method but you can everything on this

215
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,100
view will become animated according to

216
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,470
the this animation tab

217
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,610
and one more thing we can do we can

218
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,040
actually add in pictures as well so you

219
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,260
can add in an image like if we had this

220
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,480
image of this top hat this has a

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
transparent background so it shows

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,950
really nice like this and it's also we

223
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,680
can control the layer it's on here so it

224
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,150
can be behind the text if we want it to

225
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,120
be and then that will also everything

226
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,470
will just get zoomed in there so if you

227
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,900
have a logo that you want to add in with

228
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,690
your text you can do that as well

229
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,290
hopefully this video has been

230
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,940
