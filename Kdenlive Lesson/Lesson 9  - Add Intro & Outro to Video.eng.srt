00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,070
welcome back to another video editing

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,420
tutorial using the free software

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,509
kdenlive in this video i'm going to be

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,849
showing you my workflow for using

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,759
kdenlive when i edit my youtube videos

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,670
to upload them to youtube so what I have

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,500
is actually a couple different videos I

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,689
have my intro screen looks like this

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,740
it's just one mp4 video and I also have

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,009
my outro screen it looks like this and

11
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:33,900
it's just out row that plays for I

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,090
believe 6 seconds and this is where my

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,820
videos go this is a nothing's happening

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,330
here but I still made a video just

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,820
because so I'm going to drag both of

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,000
these in to my project bin and then most

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,220
of the time I actually don't have to so

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,870
I'm recording with OBS I'm recording

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,910
right now this is my screen recording

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,940
that I'm doing to do this video but also

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,930
I mean when those are done I everything

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,410
go it gets saved to this OBS video

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,900
folder on a separate 500 gigabyte hard

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,240
drive on my computer so this is the

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,640
video I'm recording right now but if I

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,830
these are all the like the kdenlive

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,930
tutorials I've been making and a couple

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,880
of them needs some edits so this lesson

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,850
8 one needs an edit all the rest of my

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,110
backs are pretty good to go but so I'm

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,560
going to do the lesson 8 1 so will bring

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,909
less than 8 in and the reason it needs

33
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,070
an edit is the only part I want to edit

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,920
from this one was speaking up the

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,450
rendering time I think I rendered out a

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,610
video and it took about a minute and a

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,350
half I just didn't want to have you the

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,420
viewer be waiting a minute and a half so

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,860
I'm just gonna speed that portion of the

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,140
video up so I'll show you how to do that

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,750
so first of all I want to drag in oh and

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,060
also so all these video clips if you

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
have VLC installed you can check but I

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,560
go to play the video back to another

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,740
video and we can go to or dad tools and

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,530
then codec information under VLC if you

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,630
have VLC installed and it will tell you

48
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,299
so this is 1920 by 1080 awesome the

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,219
frame rate is 60 frames per second

50
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,609
awesome and this is like just some more

51
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,170
information about it and so actually all

52
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,010
of my video

53
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,319
our that so if I go to my other ones

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,370
like this

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,360
outro even though it's just a still

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,220
nothing's happening we can just we can

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,959
still go to codec information and look

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,829
alright 60fps 1920 by 1080 so I made

59
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,319
sure that all of my video clips are 60

60
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,500
frames per second 1920 by 1080 and for a

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,450
screenshot 60fps is really kind of

62
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,010
overkill I'm still deciding I'll

63
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,269
probably go back down to 30

64
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,540
but for now I'm doing 60fps so what I

65
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,489
need to do is go to my project project

66
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,190
settings and change my project to a

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,129
60fps 1080p project changing the profile

68
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,590
on your project cannot be undone okay

69
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,590
continue so perfect there we go if I

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,030
wouldn't have done that I would have had

71
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,859
issues I would have been creating a

72
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,569
video that was 30 frames per second

73
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,609
using footage that was 60 frames per

74
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,409
second so I would have had some sync

75
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,389
issues with my audio and it would have

76
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,109
not been pretty alright so first of all

77
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,879
I'm going to drag in my intro and put it

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,019
on video track 1

79
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,449
I started at 0 seconds there then I'm

80
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,329
gonna grab in my main part of the video

81
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,269
and just put it right here and I'll

82
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,359
scroll to the end of this video it's

83
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,970
quite long and I'll put my outro right

84
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,299
at the end and actually outro I usually

85
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,099
like to put up on track 2 and overlap it

86
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,780
a little bit so this is ooh man let's do

87
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,459
what we'll do the intro first actually

88
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,389
so let me come here whoa where's it at

89
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,090
alright so I'm just going to watch and

90
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,680
see how it looks with my intro and

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,930
transitioning into the video welcome

92
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,769
back some green flashes but that I think

93
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,030
it's just gonna happen in my play black

94
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,019
play back welcome back I don't think

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,159
those green flashes will be there but

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,030
we'll see for sure

97
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,989
ok so I had a little bit of a little bit

98
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,299
of time here so I'm gonna actually

99
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,310
shorten this just a teeny tiny bit to

100
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,209
get rid of that little click

101
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,360
welcome back to another video editing

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,129
perfect so this is how this will start

103
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,530
and then at some point in this video I

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,960
need to actually edit I gotta find this

105
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,909
the part that I'm exporting out and I'm

106
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,169
just gonna speed up the video during

107
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,639
that portion so let me find that real

108
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,139
quick oh this is it right here perfect

109
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,789
so I can see on the screen that it's

110
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,229
doing it okay so let's go back a little

111
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,000
bit before see what's happening at this

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,060
portion let's go to render will render

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,949
it select the zone and we'll save it to

114
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,440
the desktop and we'll call it a whoops

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,240
we'll just call it something and then

116
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,069
we'll make sure it's an mp4 I like to

117
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,330
you could do WebM but

118
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,479
mp4 is kind of this a good standard for

119
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,069
uploading to like Facebook or YouTube

120
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,659
video we render this out okay so right

121
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,280
here after I said I want to pause the

122
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,409
video while we render it out I'm going

123
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,840
to grab my razor tool I'm going to cut

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,159
the video clip right here I'm gonna play

125
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,300
well not really play actually I guess I

126
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,979
can just skip forward and look I can

127
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,199
kind of see that progress bar so I want

128
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,280
to go tell the progress bar is

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,509
completely done or almost done even grab

130
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,759
it right there and then I will grab my

131
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,490
razor tool and cut the video again then

132
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,919
go to my selection tool select this

133
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,529
video and I could just I could just

134
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,690
delete this all the way out but maybe

135
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,340
just kind of be fun let's just apply a

136
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,630
speed effect and let's actually have it

137
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,900
oops I've done effect speed and we'll

138
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,240
drag speed down onto this and we'll just

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,389
make it be a thousand percent instead of

140
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,810
a hundred percent perfect now it's nice

141
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,029
and short and now I think we can play

142
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,199
and see but it might be a little bit

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,909
laggy the video

144
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,629
and it'll actually play a lot faster

145
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,009
than that okay so that took about the 47

146
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,919
let me see how fast this is yeah in fact

147
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,139
I'm gonna do two thousand percent you

148
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,249
guys as time is valuable

149
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,370
let's make this super short okay there

150
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,259
we go alright and then I have to go back

151
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,550
and because I just kind of shortened

152
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,779
this video a little bit I'm going to

153
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,870
bring my outro and put it right here and

154
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,699
the reason I overlap it a little bit is

155
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,050
just because it's usually a little bit

156
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,090
of empty space or silent space at the

157
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:02,610
end of my videos next one okay so

158
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,620
actually about right I guess this didn't

159
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,210
have a whole lot maybe that's good but I

160
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,710
bet I catch on next one cool all right

161
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,680
I'm gonna render this out and I guess

162
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,789
this is gonna be a similar situation

163
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:22,349
because this is gonna take a while to

164
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,389
render I don't click render and we're

165
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,469
gonna go to mp4 we're gonna choose the

166
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,539
file name so I will render it - I'm

167
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:34,919
gonna put it here I'll put it in this

168
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,860
folder right here I'll just call it Kade

169
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,139
and live lesson 8 fixed and I'll hit

170
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,589
save alright so mp4 it's gonna render

171
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,089
according to our project settings with

172
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,250
this which is 60 frames per second 1920

173
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,479
by 1080 and I'll hit render to file and

174
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,919
then I'm gonna have to also pause this

175
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
video and speed it up so it's just like

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,370
a never-ending video editing project but

177
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,199
I'm curious here so it says waiting it's

178
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,789
actually taking a little bit of a second

179
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,979
to get this going I wonder why okay

180
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,899
there it goes so it's gonna be 23

181
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,509
minutes to render out this nine minute

182
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,889
video that's interesting okay so that's

183
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,259
done encoding now and we can close this

184
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,419
we can go and take a look and see where

185
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,860
our finished product looks like make

186
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,729
sure doesn't have those green flashing

187
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,870
things so this is the file

188
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,760
welcome back to another video editing

189
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,200
tutorial using the free software

190
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,110
kdenlive in this video we're going to be

191
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,760
and I like to actually skip forward a

192
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
little bit I have to watch certain parts

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,230
of it sometimes certain objects like

194
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,390
transparent layers not in kdenlive just

195
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,210
in video in general sometimes certain

196
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,950
portions of video don't display the way

197
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,630
you think they're going to so I just

198
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,980
like to go through and watch and listen

199
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,650
make sure the audio is on track with

200
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,230
everything and then that way I know it's

201
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,400
a good video and this looks like it's

202
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:16,680
good cool

203
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,020
very good so that's my workflow using

204
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,270
kdenlive and actually I'll release

205
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,800
another video but just recently I

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,010
started using a batch script or like a

207
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,440
shell script to do batching batch

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,870
editing on these videos so now what I do

209
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,959
I just take the entire folder and I just

210
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,820
have a little script that uses ffmpeg

211
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,529
and it goes through and actually just

212
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,810
adds the intro and the outro to every

213
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,130
one of them I'm still kind of

214
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,950
fine-tuning it but when I get that

215
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,600
working really well I'll release a video

216
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,220
and show you that workflow saves a ton

217
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,610
of time not having to edit all of them

218
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,709
and actually I'm trying to get it so I

219
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,270
don't have to actually re-encode so

220
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,860
instead of waiting like 20 minutes to

221
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,700
encode on the processor I can just

222
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,500
actually add in since they're all mp4s I

223
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,390
can actually just add them all together

224
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,020
and it's a very quick process anyway

225
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,550
that's my workflow for kdenlive

226
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,200
appreciate you watching like and

227
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,370

228
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,930
