00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,360
do you guys know that in 2022 a blender

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,600
was downloaded 17 million times crazy

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,559
number it's not the total number of

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,280
users because some people are

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
downloading every release in the year

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,880
and then others are using a release from

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,680
years prior but the best guess of

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,119
blender's total user size is about 10

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,800
million 10 million blender users but I

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,599
now have to follow with some rather sad

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,039
news only about 3600 of them are

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,800
actually contributing to the blender

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,760
Development Fund that means and this is

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,719
the scary bit if you were to fill the

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,440
Yankee Stadium with 46,000 blender users

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,000
only about 17 of them would be

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
contributors now not only is this not a

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,440
great look for the open-source world but

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,239
it means that blender is going to be

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,320
developed slower than paid software like

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,199
I mentioned previously that the texture

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,000
painting features of blender are rather

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,960
limited and old well they've wanted to

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,440
build proper PBR texture painting for

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,559
years but they lack the funds to hire a

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
full-time developer the same applies to

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,439
the broken fire and fluid Simulator the

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,280
video sequence editor the list goes on

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
and we could have all of these

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,439
improvements today if we only had the

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,880
funds so last month I was at the blunder

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Institute speaking to Franchesco City

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
and he asked for my help to bring

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
awareness to this so I'm asking you

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
right now that's right right now donate

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
if you're enjoying this series and you

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
like blender then please pause this

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,040
video right now and take 2 minutes to

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,439
sign up and pick a plan not only do you

40
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,960
get to be one of the cool 17 people in

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,159
the stadium that's donating but you'll

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,079
know that the Amazing Story of blender

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,759
gets to continue because of you and if

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
you do join the Development Fund because

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,640
of this video then please comment below

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,159
with # jooin blender so that I can tally

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,360
up how much of an impact this little PSA

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
and the series has had as a whole so

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,159
with that out of the way let's get on to

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,119
the tutorial so how did you go with your

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,520
homework did you take a stab at creating

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,799
the plate did you do it or did you wait

53
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,960
for me to show you the answer hope you

54
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,318
did uh if you didn't you're only

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,200
cheating yourself as the teacher say um

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,519
but no seriously give it a shot if you

57
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:15,879
haven't already I do think it helps you

58
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,680
uh helps you to learn but if you don't

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,519
want to can't stop you uh but I'll show

60
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,040
you now how I created this plate so

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
first of all um I load in the image

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,800
reference first um and I haven't shown

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,519
you how to do that yet so I'll show you

64
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,959
now if you go to the top of the screen

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,840
until the cursor changes on that line

66
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,319
there just right click and then say

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,280
vertical split and then I now get two

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
duplicate Windows this second window I

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
can now make any other window type so

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
the one I'm looking for is image editor

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,319
now go image and open so this is the

72
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,360
image we're going to use it's one from

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,920
polygon because it's actually one of our

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,120
models it's a real ceramic plate that we

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,800
photos scanned turned into a model but I

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
thought it's also just a really nice

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,879
simple modeling exercise for beginners

78
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,319
so why not model off of that okay so

79
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,920
shift a because you got to start with

80
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,799
something now a lot of you probably

81
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,239
started with a cylinder um and that's a

82
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,159
fine way to go about it but I know from

83
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,799
experience that the cylinder's got a top

84
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,319
face on it that we don't need and then

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
the normals have to be flipped and you

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
have to deal with the size and I find

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
it's actually just easier to start with

88
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,959
a circle and then build out from that so

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,840
the circle settings obviously want to

90
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,000
turn the radius down to be yeah just I

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,360
mean I think a plate is roughly the size

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,599
of like two doughnut widths anyway like

93
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,159
roughly 24 30 cm whatever so anyway a

94
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,159
radius of around uh 12 CM now the

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,439
vertices that's the resolution of your

96
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,519
mesh right now you might remember when

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,519
we did the dut when we added the Taurus

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,480
I said it's good to start with a low

99
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,760
poly mesh to begin with because it's

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,400
easier to add detail than it is to try

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,280
to take it away later and that's true

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
and it's good advice for like organic

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,159
flowy shapes but in this case I know

104
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,040
that looking at the reference it's got

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,159
bevels like tight bevels here and here

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,720
and it's going to be a lot easier to

107
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
control that if I just use the bevel

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,640
tool as we model rather than trying to

109
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,439
use a subsurf modifier later which is

110
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,799
all to say that the resolution of the

111
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,000
circle that we start with I actually

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,199
want to be the final representation so

113
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,639
essentially this needs to be as round

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
and high resolution as it needs to be

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
until so that I won't see any jaggedness

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,160
in the final model so I actually went

117
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,960
with a 100 vertices which is quite High

118
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
poly but we have got the camera really

119
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,320
close to it so I think it makes sense

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,759
okay so in edit mode make sure you're in

121
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,759
verticy select mode I've done recording

122
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,199
so many times I can't remember when I've

123
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,520
uh actually taught something or not but

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,199
you can swap in and out of these modes

125
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,400
by the way by hitting uh the one two and

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,520
three key so one for vertices two for

127
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,039
Edge and then three for face select okay

128
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,520
so with verticy select I'm going to

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,240
start by creating this lip that goes up

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,919
so e and then Zed to lock it on the Zed

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,000
axis to about there I mean we don't have

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
measurements but that looks like it

133
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,520
could be plausible and I think it's on a

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
slight angle very slight so I'm going to

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
scale out just by hitting s all right

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
now for this next part of the lip I'm

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,520
going to hit e to extrude extrude again

138
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,560
but I don't want to uh move it anywhere

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,759
I want to do it exactly where it is but

140
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,960
then scale it out out so right click and

141
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
then s to scale out

142
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,919
all right and it's a good idea also to

143
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,880
just zoom out and see in proportion to

144
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,400
the plate is that lip about the right

145
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,000
size I think it is that's pretty good

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
and now I'm going to do another lip on

147
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,160
the other side just going up so e z to

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
about there that's pretty good and then

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,759
s to scale out as

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,600
well okay awesome now uh when you add in

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,560
a circle it doesn't come with a face by

152
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,720
default so if we go into wireframe mode

153
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
which also uh you can swap sorry not

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,919
that mode y frame mode you can swap in

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
and out of these modes at the top here

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,319
by holding down the Zed key so solid

157
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,199
View and YF frame I usually just quickly

158
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
flip in between those um like that all

159
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
right so if I hold down alt and click on

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,360
this line you can see there's no face in

161
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,000
the middle because wherever there is a

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
face is there should be like this orange

163
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
tint so when I alt click here I don't

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,319
see the orange tint which means I need

165
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,680
to have a face so F to create a face now

166
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,720
we need some bevels okay so we need a

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,840
bevel that goes here another one that

168
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,000
goes here and another one that goes here

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,720
so we did that when we uh added the

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
sprinkle and the hotkey for it is contrl

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,759
B but I don't want to just create like

172
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,599
the same uh bevel here and then do

173
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,800
another one here and then another one

174
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
here I can do them all at the same time

175
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,639
so if I hit alt and shift and then

176
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,199
clicked on these lines if I did contrl B

177
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,520
now I would get a bevel everywhere but

178
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,919
the problem is is that I'm also getting

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,720
the bevel on the lines that are going uh

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
this way right like uh these lines which

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
is not what I want but it doesn't know

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
that I don't want them there because

183
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,199
those are edges that are also selected

184
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,840
right this uh this line that goes like

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,160
that so what you need to use is just a

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
different tool so instead of verticy

187
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,240
Select mode I'm going to use Edge select

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,080
mode and now when I hit uh alt click on

189
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,919
that line and then shift alt click on

190
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,360
this line it's only selecting those

191
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
edges and not the edges in between which

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
means now when I do contrl B to create

193
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,199
that bevel I'm getting the bevel just

194
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,319
where I want it on those three uh three

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
edges all right now the tightness of

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
that it's pretty tight but does need to

197
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,520
be a little bit higher poly so I'm just

198
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,120
mousing sorry scrolling up on my uh on

199
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,039
my mouse to about there that's good and

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,599
now solid view great pretty good all

201
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,080
right getting there now we got a paper

202
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
thin plate we don't want that so for

203
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,720
thickness I'm hoping most of you got

204
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
this right but it's our old trusty

205
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
modifier the solidifier modifier that we

206
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,360
used previously it's too thick by

207
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,840
default um I I think I went with

208
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,000
04 like that all right and then because

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
I want to do a bevel on this edge here I

210
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,560
can't do it unless this solidify

211
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,759
modifier is applied so drop down and

212
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,800
then hit apply and now in edit mode I've

213
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400
got both of those edges so again holding

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
down alt and shift alt click on those

215
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,919
two edges and now I'm going to do

216
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,000
another bevel right here contrl + B and

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,720
pull it out now you'll see that it it

218
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
reaches a point where they start to

219
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
overlap and that's not good I don't want

220
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,280
that I want it to be I do actually want

221
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
it to be a complete round form like

222
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
really like essentially that but you can

223
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,039
see I can't really get it exactly right

224
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,080
where they're just like meeting in the

225
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,279
middle so there's actually when you're

226
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
in certain States in blunder you'll see

227
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,600
at the bottom of your screen along uh

228
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,760
let me just do this along this line here

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,640
you can see you've got a number of uh

230
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,959
shortcuts that it lists and one of them

231
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,360
says C for clamp overlap and currently

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,120
it's listed as off so if I oh dear let's

233
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,360
guel that if I uh when I hit control B

234
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,000
whilst I'm in this state if I hit C it

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,320
will turn clamp overlap on which means

236
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,079
it will only bevel until the point that

237
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,000
the edges touch and then it will stop

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
and that is exactly what I want so I'll

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
just click to confirm and now we have a

240
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,160
plate but when you're modeling something

241
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,200
like this it's very common if you're

242
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,399
doing like extrusions and then you're

243
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,480
canceling the extrus and then you're

244
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,079
scaling out you can end up with vertices

245
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,000
on top of vertices and in fact when we

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
did that bevel clamping thing I think

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
what it's done is it's got two edges and

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
they've now merged the vertices in the

249
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
middle but they the um it's sharing the

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,959
same space so whenever you've got two

251
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,040
vertices in exactly the same space you

252
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,440
can have like artifacting that will

253
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
occur later on so after I model

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,279
something like this I just go into uh

255
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,480
edit mode I select everything by hitting

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
a and then I want to find all of those

257
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,000
vertices that are uh accidentally in the

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,680
wrong place and then hit M and then I

259
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
want to say merge by distance and now

260
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
you can see on the bottom of my screen

261
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,000
look at that it merged 300 vertices I've

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
modeled this pled a few times sometimes

263
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,320
it it deleted like 400 vertices usually

264
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,040
it deletes 100 um evidently when I was

265
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
uh yeah doing the Extrusion and then

266
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
cancelling it I think I maybe did it a

267
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,839
few times so we had like three rings

268
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,680
essentially in the exact same place so

269
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,040
that's why you do that step because if

270
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,320
we didn't then you would have that and

271
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
you wouldn't know until you see

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,240
artifacts later on all right but that's

273
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,839
it we now have a wonderful looking plate

274
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,720
and we can uh close that oh yeah I

275
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,079
should show you how to close the the

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
window um so when you are closing

277
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
something you can go here on this Edge

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
and you can right click and then say

279
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
join areas the other way is if you go to

280
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
the top right hand corner of the screen

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,839
you get this little like targeting

282
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,839
cursor and then if you click and drag

283
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,680
left or right that will also merge it's

284
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,079
just that's how you used to create

285
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,600
Windows and blender you can also drag

286
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,920
out from it and that will split the view

287
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,200
um that's it's kind of an old habit of

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
mind but most people just prefer to like

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,440
until the cursor changes right click and

290
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,360
then say that but I still do that

291
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,800
sometimes and then I forget I'm doing a

292
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
tutorial and I have to explain it all

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
right so the plate um we want to make it

294
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,800
smooth so right click shade smooth and

295
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
the reason we have flickering right here

296
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,839
is the top of our plate is uh

297
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,160
overlapping with the countertop so we

298
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
just need to move this up slightly so

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
that it's not doing that um and if you

300
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
actually go underneath your countertop

301
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,639
this is usually a very easy way to

302
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,720
quickly make it so that um it's touching

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
you just have a little bit of overlap

304
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
and then um yeah then it it looks

305
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
plausible awesome we have our plate um

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
now if I move out here you can see this

307
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,639
this big giant arrow thing this is our

308
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,399
camera and it's just too big the

309
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,880
visualization of it is so big that I've

310
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,360
got lines in the way and I just I don't

311
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,639
like it um it's actually a pretty good

312
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,959
scale for a normal scene which is you

313
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,600
know usually tens or hundreds of meters

314
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
but we're so small that this camera is

315
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,480
just too big so in the camera tab go to

316
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
Viewpoint display and then just turn

317
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
down the size right um and I'll go for

318
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,160
yeah like 10% of what it was to about a

319
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,560
0.1 okay great so what we want to do now

320
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,600
is start laying out the scene so first

321
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,680
and foremost I'm going to go into

322
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,519
looking through my camera view and I

323
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,199
want to get the camera placement right

324
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,160
so hitting shift titer key to put me

325
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,079
into uh fly View and then just scrolling

326
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,880
down so that you get really small

327
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,440
movements not that small to scroll up a

328
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,399
little bit all right and then I'm using

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
q and E to just change the height of the

330
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,720
camera to be roughly where I want it all

331
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
right so I'm going to have a stack of

332
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,519
donuts so I'm going to have like one

333
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,959
here one here one here so um I'm just

334
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
making room for that essentially I

335
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,880
shouldn't use this annotation tool it's

336
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,920
uh it's being replaced in blender like

337
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,360
the new grease pencil is going to be

338
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,560
pretty amazing um but anyways it's the

339
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
old old annotation tool so uh yeah let's

340
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,600
start stacking some donuts so selecting

341
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,959
the base donut and then shift selecting

342
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,920
the icing I'm going to duplicate that by

343
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,560
shift d and then moving it up along the

344
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,040
Zed axis until they start to touch now

345
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,920
there is actually some new snapping

346
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Tools in blender that is uh pretty handy

347
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
but from experience having tried it for

348
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,880
this there's so many like little little

349
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
pieces of sprinkle and everything that

350
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,720
you're going to have overlapping anyway

351
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,079
because Donuts are quite spongy so they

352
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,360
would be you know it would be plausible

353
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,120
that it would be like kind of squishing

354
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,320
the sprinkle so it's okay to have some

355
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,959
clipping so something like that is okay

356
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,399
now I'm going to do another donut so

357
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,519
shift d again move it up along the Zed

358
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
axis uh to about there and I want to

359
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,760
make it an interesting stack not just

360
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
like a straight stack so I'll move these

361
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,600
around so that we've got kind of a like

362
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,759
an S shape like that all right duplicate

363
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,079
these again so this is going to be a

364
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,120
stack of

365
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,560
four like so

366
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,079
and then this one I'll pull back this

367
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,160
way rotate that go

368
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,920
down all right and pull it back a little

369
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
bit okay lovely now looking from the

370
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,639
camera you can see a pattern that has

371
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,959
emerged um so you can see this is the

372
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,519
same as this is the same as this and the

373
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,240
eye is very good at detecting pattern so

374
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,959
that's going to be a very big uh deal

375
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,399
breaker for the viewer they're going to

376
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,560
notice that and it's just going to make

377
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,240
the picture look worse so with each

378
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,120
donut selected one by one I going to hit

379
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,759
R and then tap Zed and that's going to

380
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,000
just rotate along the Zed axis but you

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
can see if I just tap Zed that that that

382
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,639
uh axis that I I put it on a little bit

383
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,800
like just tilted it it's now uh like

384
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,240
reverse the Tilt because I'm rotating

385
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
along the Zed but what you can do is you

386
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,040
can rotate it along its original axis by

387
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,759
not tapping Zed once but twice okay and

388
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,959
you can see that the line has now

389
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,440
changed a little bit because that's

390
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
putting us now into the local Zed axis

391
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
so the original uh rotation of that

392
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
donut it's the Zed axis on that one not

393
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,959
the scene one so yeah that's the way I

394
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,759
will do it um and I just want to rotate

395
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,839
it until I get a different pattern so

396
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,440
now I've got these little wavy shapes

397
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,759
that's good now this one I'm going to

398
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,240
tap r and then Zed and Z again so it's

399
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,079
the uh the local axes that's pretty good

400
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,759
and then this one I'll do the same thing

401
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,360
r z z and just move it a little bit that

402
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,319
way all right and now it's a lot less

403
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,920
predictable cool and now the same thing

404
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,160
for this one so I'm going to do a stack

405
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,319
of three so four and then three on this

406
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,839
one so shift d

407
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,920
Zed and just coming in here this isn't

408
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
hard this is just um it's just a little

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,240
finicky right um it would be good

410
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,319
actually if you could use motion sorry

411
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,440
not motion like a simulation Blended

412
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,920
does have rigid body tools but it's

413
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
again if we had more uh funding from

414
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,120
some people we could improve it because

415
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,480
the rigid body tools are pretty janky

416
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
they don't work well for small objects

417
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,240
and it's very fiddly to set up but I've

418
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,560
seen other tools plugins that people

419
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,600
have made for like Unreal Engine where

420
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,880
placing objects is actually a simulation

421
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,519
so you just drawer across the plane and

422
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,240
you could have like donuts just spawn in

423
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,240
and like tumble on each other um and it

424
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
just means that you don't have a lot of

425
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,519
this finicky uh hand placing of stuff

426
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,360
but for probably for a simple scene like

427
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
this I would probably hand place the

428
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,839
donuts anyway because you can finesse it

429
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,399
a lot better than you would in a a

430
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,279
simulation anyway

431
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,959
um all right so just like before making

432
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,240
it trying to yeah try and make it look

433
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,680
interesting as interesting as I can move

434
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,880
this one closer that's pretty good and

435
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,800
then so that we don't have the repeating

436
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,639
shapes r z

437
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,399
z like that and that's pretty good

438
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,440
actually uh this one it's a little bit

439
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,560
further okay move that a little bit more

440
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
all right there we

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,480
go uh oh did I not hit

442
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,360
hang on did I Z okay I thought maybe I

443
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,799
didn't uh tap Zed twice but evidently I

444
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,640
did it's just it's got this weird gap

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,319
which I going to have to close now

446
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,000
okay sorry if you can hear traffic I am

447
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,480
right next to a road I thought hey I

448
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,359
need an office why don't I get an office

449
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,679
right next to a busy road with

450
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,839
glass but I'll be moving out of here

451
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,200
soon planning to move country if I can

452
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
I won't say where I'm moving to no I'm

453
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,000
planning to move uh to the United States

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
actually looking to get a Visa because

455
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,559
uh I want to move to La La it's where

456
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,880
all the other YouTubers are and uh I

457
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,080
don't know every time I go there I come

458
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,960
back with like a bunch of ideas and yeah

459
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,480
so I'm moving if I can still waiting for

460
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,600
a visa to be approved but uh we'll we'll

461
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,880
see all right so I'm just making small

462
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,960
adjustments here and there all right and

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,320
the final donut that I will create take

464
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,360
this uh I'll just take this bottom one

465
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,559
shift d and I'm going to make a doughnut

466
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,919
which is going to be um like rotated to

467
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,559
the camera a little bit so yeah let's

468
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
move on one axis said here and it's just

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,919
going to be like this because this is a

470
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,600
much more readable shape that tells you

471
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
exactly what it is because I mean this

472
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,280
these Stacks could make you believe that

473
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,480
maybe it's bagels or like little mini

474
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,640
cakes or something like that so having

475
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
this one rotated towards the camera

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,960
makes it very clear that these are

477
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,240
donuts awesome all right cool now uh it

478
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,880
wasn't supposed to be that we have round

479
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,600
sprinkles on this side and then long

480
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,720
sprinkles on this side uh that's just

481
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,400
because we were duplicating shapes but

482
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,520
because we've done this with geometry

483
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,480
nodes it's really simple to just swap it

484
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
out to be something else so this one

485
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
here I actually just want it to be the

486
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,159
long sprinkles so in your geometry node

487
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,280
dropdown click long sprinkles and there

488
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,240
we go just just swapped it out and now I

489
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,960
can mix it up a bit I can say this one

490
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,880
here I want to have round sprinkles uh

491
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,039
this one at the bottom I don't want to

492
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,919
have any sprinkles so it's just a bare

493
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,760
dut cuz those do exist right uh this one

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
I'll I'll say round sprinkles on there

495
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
and then I'll make this one long

496
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
sprinkles yeah and then maybe this one

497
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,960
I'll delete it as well so we get like

498
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,159
two plain ones that's pretty good and

499
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,440
there's a big gap here I don't know why

500
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,400
how did that happen what did I do wrong

501
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,120
evidently I made a big

502
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,480
gap by the way here's a tip if if you

503
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,320
double so if you just hit R you're in

504
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,799
like like tilt mode but if you tap

505
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,760
double r so you tap r twice it's now in

506
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,280
track ball rotation mode which depending

507
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
on your view can be what you want so I

508
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,679
just go there double tap r and I just

509
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,679
rotate it towards the camera a little

510
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,919
bit and pull it

511
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,120
down maybe that's what I did maybe I

512
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,640
lowered the bottom donuts and then the

513
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,159
top ones didn't go with

514
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,760
it if you wanted to you could actually

515
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,679
parent the donuts to each other other so

516
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,080
that when you rotate or move one on the

517
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,280
bottom then it moves the one on the top

518
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,240
but I don't think it's really necessary

519
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,919
and it can be a little bit hard to work

520
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,080
with as well so yeah oh they're now

521
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,480
touching I got to move

522
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,039
apart yeah something like

523
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,280
that awesome now the countertop I'm

524
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,520
going to scale this out until the edges

525
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,159
of the countertop like this Edge that is

526
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,400
here and then this Edge that are here I

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
just outside of the frame because I

528
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,679
camera I mean we are going to add a a

529
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,640
camera animation so that it goes down

530
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,679
but we're not going to be like doing a

531
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,200
360 pan of the duts so we're not going

532
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,039
to be able to see the rest of the scene

533
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,400
so we don't need a kitchen countertop

534
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
that stretches all out this way uh it's

535
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,919
just a waste of resources um so we're

536
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,360
just going to literally just stop at the

537
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,280
edges of where the camera can see I used

538
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,559
to think when I was starting 3D that

539
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,600
that's like lazy but now I'm like no

540
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,120
that's like how you use your resources

541
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,480
properly otherwise you end up doing

542
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,640
stuff that nobody ever sees um which is

543
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,200
actually a pretty common problem in the

544
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
industry um people over engineer models

545
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,200
and things just in case the camera needs

546
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,280
to be close and it never does and then

547
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,640
yeah anyway now I do want a backsplash

548
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,919
for this so I'm just going to duplicate

549
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,240
the bottom plane here so shift d pull it

550
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,760
out uh to you know roughly there and

551
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,960
then I'm going to hit R and then X so

552
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm rotating it along the x-axis and

553
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,600
then just holding down control to snap

554
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,360
it to the nearest 5° increment and in

555
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,919
the top left hand corner of my screen

556
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,640
I'm just looking for 9

557
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,840
and there it is so I do a single click

558
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll move this up like so and now we

559
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
have a backsplash and the final thing

560
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
we'll do before moving on to the next

561
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,200
tutorial is create some different

562
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,520
doughnut colors now you could actually

563
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,400
do the same thing as we did uh for the

564
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,679
sprinkles and create that random through

565
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,360
color ramp option for this the trouble I

566
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
found with doing it for the doughnut

567
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,480
icings is that you can sometimes just

568
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,880
end up with a bad batch where you've got

569
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,000
like a string of like yellow donuts and

570
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,480
you can't change it because there's no

571
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,760
sample option for the the random thing

572
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
so I find it's better if you haven't got

573
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,159
enough objects to instead just manually

574
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,440
set up the colors um and it also just

575
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
allows you allows you to finesse it as

576
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,559
as more of an artist so a long way to

577
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,760
say we're going to create different

578
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,039
materials for each of the different

579
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,320
icings so the one that's already there

580
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,760
we'll just call it pink

581
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,279
icing and now um so I definitely want

582
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,960
that one to be pink which means these

583
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
ones that are directly behind it I

584
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,039
definitely want to be a different color

585
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,880
so I'm going to click the little uh

586
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,960
number to make it a single user and I'll

587
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,640
call this one blue icing and then the

588
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,320
color I'm going to make it a kind of an

589
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,720
aaish color let's go into material

590
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,159
select there we go this one here I'm

591
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,200
going to make it a yellow icing so

592
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
clicking the little number next to it

593
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,080
there we go yellow

594
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,919
icing and then about there that's good

595
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,360
and then this one at the top I'm going

596
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,120
to make it chocolate icing click the

597
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,960
little

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,559
number chocolate icing let's go

599
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,159
Brown yeah yeah it's like how saturated

600
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,919
how warm is chocolate I mean I guess you

601
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,640
could have like a really desaturated

602
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,159
chocolate that's just very dark but I

603
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,520
think it's the more saturated is kind of

604
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,000
looks like milk chocolate like the kind

605
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,120
of delicious not the really super dark

606
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
stuff which I do actually like as an

607
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,400
adult hated it as a kid but now I don't

608
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,360
know normal chocolate it's just way too

609
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,159
sweet uh okay that now the top one H

610
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,919
I'll make that one pink yeah that's fine

611
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,640
and then this one I'll just make it blue

612
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
icing and then this one I'll make it

613
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,200
yellow icing oh wait now I've got the

614
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,679
yeah it's blue and blue and yellow and

615
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,480
yellow that's not good so this bottom

616
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,320
one no the middle one yeah middle one

617
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,120
I'll make it chocolate bottom one I'll

618
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,400
make it blue just trying to get like a

619
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,559
nice ah now I've got pink and pink next

620
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,120
to each other H all right maybe this one

621
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,760
will be yellow as well that's too yellow

622
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
all right maybe the bottom one can be

623
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,760
Pink There we go that's better all right

624
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,720
so I don't have any like it now looks

625
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,679
more natural looks which is just more

626
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,720
random I guess no less random cuz I'm

627
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,559
like manually finessing it myself so

628
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:12,360
it's less random but it looks uh more

629
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,080
random in a way anyway finally before we

630
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,760
move on let's start labeling our objects

631
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,039
so first of all I want to make sure that

632
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,159
my plane sorry my plate is inside of my

633
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,039
environment collection so I will now

634
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,240
call this plate this bottom one I will

635
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,279
call it uh yeah let call it counter and

636
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,880
then this back one I'll call it the

637
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,960
backsplash

638
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,919
backsplash

639
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,039
awesome we have done it oh we do need to

640
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,919
give a material to our plate as well

641
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,640
can't just have it as a default material

642
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
orse it'll look terrible so new material

643
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,159
and the first thing I want to do is

644
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,600
adjust the roughness and make it look

645
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,919
kind of yeah shiny like the ceramic

646
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,600
plate let me just load that up actually

647
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
one more time there we go use that as my

648
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,440
reference so it's somewhat shiny and

649
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,360
then also I want to give a subsurface

650
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,159
because ceramic does actually have a

651
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,039
little bit of that um that creamy bleed

652
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,840
through of the light so I'll turn my

653
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,600
weight up to one radius all set to one

654
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,960
and then the scale

655
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,360
01 so a very small amount of subsurface

656
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
scattering um and it'll just help it a

657
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,080
little bit the color I'll also turn down

658
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,840
it to make it a little bit not so white

659
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
and then I'll make it slightly yellow a

660
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,159
little bit yellowy creamy color just

661
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,200
like over there

662
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,960
if you want also you can buy the plate

663
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
it's just not a free model but it will

664
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,440
add realism to your scene if you want to

665
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,960
have a plate that is actually real and

666
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,320
photos scanned and it's got all these

667
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,840
little speckled little things and divots

668
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,559
across it if you want it is optional all

669
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,320
right so that is it guys join me in the

670
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,919
next part and we're going to get into

671
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,679
lighting I'll see you there
