1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,639
we are on the home stretch well done for

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,440
sticking with the series it's uh it's a

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,920
lot of work a lot to uh retain but uh

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,240
well done for sticking with it now a

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,480
couple of things before we jump into

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,039
compositing the fun compositing stuff um

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
I noticed a couple of things that I

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,039
could tweak to the lighting just to

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,600
improve it and it's important we do it

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
now because what we're going to do next

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,439
relies on the lighting being uh correct

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,560
so um the first is I noticed that the

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,040
the light rotation it would be a little

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,879
bit better if I rotated it so it's

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,440
almost like a 90° like completely side

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,320
onto the donuts um so that's pretty

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
simple change the other one I noticed is

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,920
that I'm getting this like kind of ugly

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,760
bounce light coming off this uh both the

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,600
plate and the table so to fix that I can

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,160
just move right go into edit mode Edge

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,280
select mode select the edge of this

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,320
window and then if I just drag drag it

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,600
you'll see that the light just

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,119
disappears off the front there and now I

26
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,479
have controlled the light now the other

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,200
thing speaking of control I notice

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,479
looking at this wall like I was trying

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,280
to tweak it and just try to improve it

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,600
but this is like a huge uh source of

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,680
light right and so if you look on our

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,040
donut it's not very controlled right I

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,119
could either if I if I want to fill in

34
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,759
this space I could increase the

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,799
brightness of that wall but you can see

36
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,400
it just it throws light just everywhere

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
and I don't really have any control over

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,920
it so change my mind let's not use that

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,200
as a fill Source let's just drop the

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,880
value to zero so there is now no light

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,320
coming off of that wall it is a black

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,840
void um which is actually pretty I mean

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,320
that's like a photographer holding up a

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
black uh fill card next to her face uh

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,840
and

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,759
instead excuse

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,600
me okay quick break there had to get a

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,560
drink of water

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
instead I'm going to add in a lamp Okay

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
so I'm going to shift right Mouse click

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,719
so that I drop it on the ground here in

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,880
front uh sorry to the side and then I'm

53
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,959
going to go shift a and I'm going to add

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,599
in not a point lamp not a sun but an

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,239
area lamp Okay so this is this is what

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,680
it looks like it's just it looks like a

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,959
plane right flat Square thing and it

58
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,080
casts it in the direction of that Arrow

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,160
so I want to rotate it along the Y AIS

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
just holding down control and in the top

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,760
left you can see we get a 90 ° angle so

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
that's what I'm looking for and then the

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,560
size of this I want to drop the size in

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,000
the setting there okay so I just can go

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,159
really small

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,440
actually and now if I pull in close with

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,800
render View mode we should see a lot

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
more

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,519
control over where that fill light goes

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,440
all right so I can pull it in nice and

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,840
close right now that's obviously way too

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,920
bright so I'll just now dial that

73
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,440
back like so and I can now pull it

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
forward forward so that I get the fill

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,319
light exactly where I want but that's

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
you know that's 3D right you try out an

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,080
idea you're like okay that could work

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
and then you look at and you're like H

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
maybe not you know I'll try a different

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,599
one um but yeah so I'm just going to

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,760
give it a bit of a yellowy tint and

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,400
that's better awesome okay so now we can

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,120
do some compositing first of all what is

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
it well the compositor is a way to add

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,480
effects to the final render so that

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,200
could be everything from a simple color

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,599
grade to like really stylized uh renders

88
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,280
so in our case we're going to use it to

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,720
add glare to better emulate a camera

90
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,879
that's really the purpose for this

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,040
tutorial so at the top of your screen

92
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,879
click on the compositor tab so this will

93
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,519
arrange your screen again disorient you

94
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,439
for a moment um but yeah wouldn't you

95
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,799
believe it it's another node screen so

96
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,280
click use nodes at the top there for

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,959
whatever reason they always appear off

98
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,200
your screen um at least in my case maybe

99
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,159
it it appears on yours but if you middle

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,360
Mouse up or just scroll down you should

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,799
be able to see it or you can just hit

102
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,079
the home key as well and that'll bring

103
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,400
it into Focus so it's actually pretty

104
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,480
similar to like geometry nodes in that

105
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,560
on the left hand side this is your

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,079
original like what you've started with

107
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,959
your original render and then on the

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,399
right hand side um it's going to be your

109
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,399
final output like that's what's uh going

110
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,680
to be saved to an image and then in

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,479
between here you can put whatever it is

112
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,160
you want you could put um a a color

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
grade you could do some post processing

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
glare and shine and things like that um

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,039
but before we can see anything because

116
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,320
normally you would see your result here

117
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,960
we can't for two reasons the first is we

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
haven't done a render okay it's not

119
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
enough to just look in like rendered

120
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,960
View mode here right this is just like a

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
temporary view whilst we're moving

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
around we have to do a proper render by

123
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,880
hitting F12 but if we did one right now

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
we would have we'd be waiting a while

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
because the maximum samples is 4,000

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
which is maybe it's like probably pretty

127
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,960
good for like film animation production

128
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,280
quality but it's Overkill and especially

129
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,360
for um for this like we're just doing

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,720
some test renders so let's set it to 100

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
samples and that'll do it way faster so

132
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,520
now let's hit F12 on that there we go so

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,800
that came through for me 7 seconds again

134
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
I got 4 309s it'll probably be a little

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
slower if you're on a laptop but yeah

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,479
just you know be patient it'll it'll

137
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,520
come through now go to the compositing

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,880
tab and we still can't see it because we

139
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,319
need to add a viewer node um and connect

140
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,560
it to this and you can do that just by

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
holding down controll shift and then

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
left clicking on your render layer and

143
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,039
now we have a viewer node and in the

144
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,919
background we have our render so some

145
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,639
people find it like a little weird to

146
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,400
have the render in the background you

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,360
can move it around just by holding down

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,160
alt and then middle Mouse button and

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,479
then middle Mouse button will move your

150
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,720
nodes around so alt middle Mouse button

151
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
for the background and then uh middle

152
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,880
Mouse for the nodes anyways as a very

153
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
quick example let's do a simple color

154
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,120
adjustment so adjustment color balance

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,960
right drop this in here now the if you

156
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,560
just dropped it into your viewer node

157
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,880
then this would be just what is going to

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
be shown in the background here but it

159
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,199
wouldn't be saved in your render until

160
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,880
it went through your composite uh node

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
but for just this quick effect it's uh

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
it's good enough so this is a um graders

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,919
know exactly what this is but it's for

164
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,440
uh on the left hand side your your

165
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,120
blacks right uh your midtones is in the

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
middle and the right hand side is your

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
highlights so if I wanted to make uh you

168
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,639
know I don't know like a cooler midtone

169
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,199
and then like a warmer highlight right

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,880
and then I don't know something for the

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
blacks like make it more green I don't

172
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
know just make something horrible you

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,560
could do it here you could make simple

174
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,759
color adjustments you could do it there

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,880
and your your original render hasn't

176
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,000
changed this is just a postprocessing

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,360
step but actually on the note of making

178
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,599
things look uh more contrasted and

179
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,599
Punchy I wouldn't actually bother with

180
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,240
the color balance note we used to but uh

181
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,599
now now blender has some pretty good

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,319
color management so I'm going to hit

183
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,840
controll X on that to just remove it but

184
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,440
retain its connection and then if you go

185
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,479
down in your render settings to color

186
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,400
management uh there is um a look uh drop

187
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,240
down here so if you set this to uh high

188
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,080
contrast that's exactly a the same as

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,039
like what we were doing there like

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,680
trying to like increase the highlights

191
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,319
or reduce the midtones it's a very

192
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
common thing to try and make something

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
look punchier and these looks will do

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
that but do it really well um a lot of

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
people make the assumption that this is

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
like you shouldn't use these or it's

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
going to like mess with the colors in

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,599
some way and like other applications

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,080
true um a lot of uh like art apps they

200
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,199
just you know you you use one of their

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,680
contrast settings and it just starts

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
like clipping highlights and things but

203
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,520
this was designed by Troy sabotka who

204
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,759
understands color science and color

205
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,919
management so it's a proper S curve you

206
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,080
won't have any clipping going on um so I

207
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,599
use this all the time usually the one I

208
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,440
go for is a medium high contrast look um

209
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,319
and it just makes a really nice looking

210
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,360
result by the way just a quick mention

211
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
in 4.0 this version of blender we

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,560
switched the view transform through to

213
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,840
agx which creates more realistic uh

214
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
looking images because previously it was

215
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,080
on filmic and it looked like this and

216
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,240
you can see the difference is

217
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,520
agx has it just looks more real um but

218
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,360
the reason for that is that filmi was uh

219
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
and actually the same with Aces right

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
now the the film like the the the one

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
the academy all the people in bfx shoes

222
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
and everything it's got this same

223
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
problem but when uh you've got color the

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,599
more exposed a color is it should

225
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,719
actually start to desaturate but what

226
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,919
Aces and what filmi was doing is it was

227
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,320
making that color more and more

228
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
saturated so that's why these bright

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
colors here are just starting to get

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,680
ugly right but agx fixes that and it

231
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,839
starts to behave more like film where it

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,839
desaturates those colors um as it

233
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,680
exposes for so very cool um and I'm glad

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
that they've got that while I'm here is

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
as well I'm just going to increase the

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
exposure a bit um it's going to blow it

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
out a little anyway we'll fix it a bit

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,880
with the lighting uh later but anyways

239
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,279
okay back to the

240
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,240
compositor so one thing that I often use

241
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
the compositor for is for uh what you

242
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,440
see in the rear World which is glare

243
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,200
right if you've got a shiny metallic

244
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
object a bumper or something like that

245
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,680
you want to have that that Starburst

246
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,360
right coming off it because that's what

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
you see in the real world you see it

248
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640
both with your eyes like if you squinted

249
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,440
something in the distance you'll see

250
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
like uh yeah like this kind of like

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,959
Starburst around like a street light at

252
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,360
night that's actually because the

253
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,320
eyelashes on your eye but on a camera

254
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
it's for a different reason it's because

255
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
of the optical elements it's kind of

256
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
like refracting around itself and it's

257
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,000
creating this uh Starburst look I don't

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
understand it fully but I know that it's

259
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,720
an artifact which has artistic use as

260
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,320
well um so we are going to add it it is

261
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,600
a little fiddly I'll be honest like

262
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
other software they just have a button

263
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,279
and it just like adds the bloom and the

264
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,720
glare and stuff

265
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,920
we we have to do this for now so shift a

266
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,560
we probably could if more people donated

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,519
to blender right we could have stuff

268
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,480
like this but anyways so not to guilt

269
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,360
you all filter

270
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,519
glare okay and that was shift a by the

271
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,240
way same hot key works everywhere um and

272
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,079
drop this in Okay so we've got little

273
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,360
Starburst we've only got four which is

274
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
not ideal we want as many as we can get

275
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,800
really so drag it up to 16 that's better

276
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,720
now uh there's two two values here you

277
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
really want to change the first is the

278
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,279
threshold that'll decide how much of the

279
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,920
image is affected like as I drag this up

280
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,120
in value it means only the really bright

281
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,600
stuff is going to be affected if you

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
dragged it really low then like

283
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,720
everything is going to give off a star

284
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
burst and it's not going to be uh what

285
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,800
you want and the other one is the mix

286
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,079
value so if you drag it all the way to

287
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,720
one then it's going to be just the just

288
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,519
the effect by itself if you drag it all

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,320
the way to minus one it's going to be

290
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,519
the original render so so if you wanted

291
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,480
a nice blend between it you could go

292
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,959
like a minus. n or something and then

293
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,600
you've got the star burst over the top

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,560
of the original render but if you want

295
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,160
to blend this with something else I find

296
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,079
it best to actually drag it the mix all

297
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,720
the way to one so that we're just

298
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,560
looking at the effect by itself um I can

299
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,399
then also let me just quickly adjust the

300
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,440
threshold so that I'm only getting it in

301
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
the really bright places yep that's good

302
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
and

303
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,040
then um I can blend it with another

304
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,079
effect that I want so I'm going to hit

305
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,519
uh control shift d and that's going to

306
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,320
duplicate it but it's going to keep it

307
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
connected to my render layer here and

308
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,360
then this one I'm going to make the fog

309
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
glow because looking at reference it's

310
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,560
not just the star burst but it's also

311
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,480
got a uh like a glare like this glow

312
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
blurry glow coming off it so the fog

313
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
glow is that look right it's just that

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,480
um and let's increase the size I think

315
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,240
and let's set the quality to high do we

316
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,920
need high quality yeah I think it looks

317
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,839
better all right all right so first to

318
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,880
blend this all together with the the

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,240
render layer what we want to do is uh

320
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,000
just like you would do in Photoshop if

321
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,639
you would use a like a blend mode you

322
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,760
would set the blend to screen or add we

323
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,399
can do that by blending with shift a

324
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,040
color mix mix color Okay so this we're

325
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
going to drag in both of our glare

326
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,880
effects and then instead of mix we're

327
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
going to set it to add so that will just

328
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,279
basically ignore the black values and it

329
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,839
will just take the white values and

330
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,279
combine them on the top of each other

331
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,040
all right now the way blender works

332
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,760
unlike Photoshop where it's like top to

333
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
bottom in this case it's bottom input up

334
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
so this Factor value will will Define

335
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,600
how bright the bottom input is okay it's

336
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,560
a little weird I guess in that respect

337
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,480
but so this is the strength of that

338
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,680
bottom input um yeah so when you're

339
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,880
blending something and you want to

340
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
control it you just put it into the

341
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,199
bottom input so the streaks it's like

342
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,800
it's way too heavy so I just want to go

343
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,360
to like a0 2 or something like that

344
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,160
really really subtle even lower goodness

345
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
it's yeah it's really heavy this Dr I

346
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
don't know why it is so bright but I

347
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,480
never want it as bright as it is um okay

348
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,880
and now to blend it with the original

349
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,240
render for my final trick I duplicate

350
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,560
that drop it in

351
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,880
here um and put this into the bottom

352
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,040
input and I'll connect this to my

353
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,600
viewer um and then let's set this to a

354
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,360
one by the way so the composite maybe I

355
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
explain anyway the composite is going to

356
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
be what's saved into your render the

357
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,199
viewer is just going to be what is

358
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,320
displayed in your your background here

359
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
so if you don't have something connected

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
into the composite it's not going to be

361
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
saved when you do uh the render okay but

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,440
that's pretty good so that's how we've

363
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,519
got a very quick glare effect over

364
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
everything it's a little heavy I might

365
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,160
just drop it back a bit um because we

366
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
want it to be just like just enough that

367
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,720
you can see it um but not crazy by the

368
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,680
way if you uh want to zoom in in your

369
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,279
backdrop you can hit uh V will shrink

370
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,040
the size of it and ALT V will zoom in

371
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,959
they really need a better one I I agree

372
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,560
I agree with that um it's uh yeah it

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,839
definitely could be better I think

374
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
there's oh you can control it like that

375
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,279
okay so if you hit your viewer node

376
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,920
you've got these little uh okay you can

377
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,880
do it like that as well but yeah have V

378
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
and all V it's like a keyboard shortcut

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
from the old days of blender and anyways

380
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,639
all right um D back I don't want to go

381
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,199
too heavy like the thing with

382
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,759
postprocessing when you're doing stuff

383
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,000
in the compositor is you can like you

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,440
just get like uh distracted you just get

385
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,920
like um like hypnotized by the effect

386
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
and it's so common to have a render that

387
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,480
a beginner has done that's actually

388
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
pretty solid but then they have just

389
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
really hammed up the post-processing

390
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,560
effect so don't do that don't get overly

391
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,759
obsessed with it because um it's almost

392
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,880
certainly Overkill you just need to dial

393
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,759
it back to like less than you're

394
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,199
comfortable with and then it's probably

395
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,279
right um because whilst you're adding it

396
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,639
you get really excited um anyways that's

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,440
what I found myself the other thing I'll

398
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,800
show you is uh if we just bring up this

399
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,440
bottom window I don't know why dope

400
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,959
sheet is the selected one makes no sense

401
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,360
for the uh compositing layout but if you

402
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
click the little drop down the top left

403
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,480
change it to 3D viewport and now in

404
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,600
rendered mode click the little drop down

405
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,279
next to it and you should see at the

406
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,240
bottom you've got options for compositor

407
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,720
H so let's click always and what you'll

408
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
see is that the compositing effects

409
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
what's happening up here is now being

410
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,759
composed live over the top of your your

411
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,920
viewport and this is a very new feature

412
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,800
I think it's actually 4.0 is when it was

413
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
officially um added in um but it's it's

414
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,880
huge because it means you can do and

415
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,000
preview your effects whilst you're

416
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,839
looking around your scene so you could

417
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,480
like look at this like hey I can see the

418
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,759
exact amount of that glare that's coming

419
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,240
off it um you could do you know you can

420
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,759
do crazy stuff in the compositing and

421
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
it'll it'll show through like as an

422
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,120
example there's a new uh

423
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,000
kahara uh filter that looks like this

424
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,880
kind of like painterly style um and you

425
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,720
can uh yeah you can preview it like live

426
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,360
in the 3D view it's like I feel like I'm

427
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
looking at a painting right now right

428
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
it's really crazy um that they that you

429
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,160
can do this real time so I'm I'm really

430
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
glad it's finally in there because it's

431
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
been uh been talked about for like a

432
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,480
year I think was when it was first

433
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,399
previewed um so it's really cool that

434
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,240
it's finally in here so one thing I will

435
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,519
use it for actually is to check that the

436
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
threshold that I've set for the the fog

437
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,600
and the streaks is actually correct so

438
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,279
I'm going to look through the let's go

439
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,639
to the streaks I think streaks is pretty

440
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,600
it's a bit slow but uh anyways let's

441
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,079
pull in

442
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,839
here um and let's just take a look I

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,560
might have to add in a little bit okay

444
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,959
there we go I have to add in a little

445
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,519
bit of the original render so I can

446
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,959
actually see but I just want to make

447
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,839
sure that it's mostly coming through on

448
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,160
the metallic objects so I might actually

449
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,279
try increasing so you can see as it's

450
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,199
like all the way at zero you're just

451
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,800
getting everything is going to get star

452
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,959
beams but then as I increase it slowly

453
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,319
slowly slowly it starts to disappear and

454
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,439
then the only thing that's really

455
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,520
getting it is those metallic objects um

456
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,079
and that's generally the look that I

457
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,880
want to go for so the okay so I went for

458
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,480
a much higher amount threshold um for

459
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,640
that anyways um you could have a

460
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,000
different amount for the the glow but I

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
think it's generally one in the same

462
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
effect so I think they should have the

463
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
same threshold so I'm actually going to

464
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,600
uh just Mouse over this and hit contrl C

465
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,240
and then Mouse over this and hit contrl

466
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,520
V so that's how you can uh copy values

467
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,919
let me just preview that yeah the fog

468
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,880
glow looks pretty good oh it's on high

469
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
that's why it's going to be a little bit

470
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,160
slow if you set it to medium I think

471
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,880
it'd be a little bit more interactive um

472
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,559
but anyways the GPU compositing I'll say

473
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,919
is is very new um as I mentioned it's

474
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,440
it's this release and it actually for

475
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,760
4.0 the actual final render like when

476
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,200
you hit render and it creates the 2D

477
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,679
image um it's actually still going to be

478
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,320
using the CPU apparently in 4.1 maybe

479
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,480
4.2 it will change and it'll be fully

480
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
GPU at that point but until then you

481
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,520
will have like slightly longer render

482
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,400
times just because of the compositor cuz

483
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,679
the compositor is famously has been

484
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
famously slow and blender for years it's

485
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
only just now that it's uh it's being

486
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,320
improved so we're not really going to do

487
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,799
a lot with a composite like I really

488
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,360
generally think you don't want to go

489
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,880
Overkill um you can just add too many

490
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
like bells and whistles to the

491
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,360
compositor um but really like if you

492
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,039
want to do like drastic changes you

493
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,200
should try to do it in the scene unless

494
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
you're doing something crazy like

495
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,640
spider-verse in which case it's all

496
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,080
stylized right um but try to do it in

497
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,720
the scene because um yeah I don't know I

498
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,640
I feel like it can be more of like a

499
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
crutch you tend to like lean towards

500
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,080
like I'll fix it in the compositor I'll

501
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,640
improve it in the compositor and it

502
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,000
doesn't one thing you might want to add

503
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,280
is underneath uh where is it transform

504
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,760
lens Distortion okay if you add in this

505
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,039
node this can replicate an effect that

506
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,000
is actually in all cameras as well and

507
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,799
that's lens Distortion all right so you

508
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,480
can see uh it actually makes more sense

509
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,799
to actually see it on the 2D image um so

510
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,320
I'll put that in the background there um

511
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,159
but basically where the edges of a uh a

512
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,600
shot it's like if you take a photo with

513
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
your iPhone on like a w it's most

514
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
visible on like wider lenses but the uh

515
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,720
straight vertical things start to look

516
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
bent um and it's just it's Barrel

517
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
Distortion and there's no way to get

518
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,280
around it unless you use a pinhole

519
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,039
camera it's it's kind of interesting

520
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,200
thing but it's it's all because of the

521
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,520
Optics of the lens that bends the the

522
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
objects like that um so anyways it is in

523
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,280
all objects uh it does though because

524
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,799
it's a like a post effect it does kind

525
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,080
of blow so it's like manipulating those

526
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
pixels so it means those pixels aren't

527
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
going to be as sharp so I generally

528
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,039
don't like it for that reason um but if

529
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,559
you wanted to you could add this just

530
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,559
keep it really low like a 0.1 amount

531
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,520
with fit so that it doesn't get that uh

532
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,960
you know TV screen look on the edges and

533
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,640
then the other thing you could add is a

534
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,520
little bit of chromatic aberration um

535
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,840
I'll show you just uh yeah this is what

536
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,240
that does so you can see this is where

537
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,600
it turned up a lot you can see the edges

538
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,640
of the objects right it has this kind of

539
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,000
uh the red and the cyan and the red and

540
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,120
the yellow it like towards the edges of

541
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,960
it it gets this um yeah this kind of

542
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
separation of the colors and that is

543
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
again a naturally occurring thing that

544
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
happens with cameras because of the

545
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,400
Optics um and the cheaper the Optics the

546
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
cheaper the lens the more likely it's to

547
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,440
happen um but it is there I try not to

548
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,000
use it because it can be very overused

549
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,760
and very like I don't just makes it look

550
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
cheap like hey this person just

551
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,400
discovered there's the chromatic

552
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
apparation but if you are going to use

553
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,039
it go really low really low like because

554
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,159
actually this you have to think of the

555
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,400
story of the shot and someone has like

556
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
framed this shot beautifully got

557
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,320
beautiful sunlight right this is a

558
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,200
professional professional has taken this

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,400
photograph of the donuts on the counter

560
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
they're not going to be using using a

561
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,520
cheap lens so although there might be

562
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,480
some chromatic aberration it'll be very

563
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
very uh minimal um but if you want that

564
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
um you know what I I'll keep it in yeah

565
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,720
why not we'll keep it in um but yeah

566
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
that's basically what I'm going to do

567
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,039
for this so this is my final node setup

568
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,880
if you'd like to copy it have ADD it the

569
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
final thing I'll mention as well is if

570
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
you want to disable your composit like

571
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,559
say you're doing some renders and you

572
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,440
don't you just want to see it without

573
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,799
the post-processing effects on top of it

574
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,440
um rather than having to come in here

575
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
and then like you know reconnect and

576
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
disconnect a bunch of nodes um instead

577
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,080
if you just go to your what's that the

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,159
output property settings way at the

579
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
bottom you've got postprocessing so if

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
you just uncheck compositing that means

581
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,320
you're only going to be seeing the

582
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,200
original render um and then check it

583
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
again and it's going to be uh kicking in

584
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,600
whatever is uh in your compositing

585
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,880
settings but that's it for this video

586
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,000
click here to watch the next part and I

587
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,559
will see you there
