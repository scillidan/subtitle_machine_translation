1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,600
and then God said let there

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,360
be light which is the topic for this

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,880
tutorial now we want to create the look

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
of a like a morning kitchen countertop

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
like you just woke up in the morning the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
sunlight's coming in and it's warm and

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,039
it's inviting so we want to have some

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,720
sunlight coming in uh from the left now

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,199
we could take our default lamp here and

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,160
turn it into a sun lamp and then try to

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
angle it like that but the reason that

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,040
this looks so terrible is that one of

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
the key components of natural light is

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,559
not just the sunlight but the Skylight

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,840
around it getting that uh the right

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,879
shades of blue and white and the

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,079
gradient as it goes towards the horizon

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,760
and that's actually quite difficult uh

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,280
to do but thankfully there's a

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,920
relatively newest feature in blender

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,520
which we can use so rather than uh using

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,199
any lamp at all I'm going to delete the

23
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,160
lamps so there is no light in my scene

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,199
whatsoever and instead go to my world uh

25
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,960
tab here and then where we've got color

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to click the little yellow Dot

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,200
and then select Sky texture and what

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,119
this is added is uh besides just the sky

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,880
texture it's also added in a sunlamp so

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,600
if I rotate around we should see look at

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,759
that real sunlight coming across it now

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
it is very hot by default so if you go

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
to your render settings underneath color

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,600
management at the very bottom here

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
you've got an exposure slider which you

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,680
use actually quite a lot um you can see

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,280
the lighting has stayed the same um and

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
it doesn't have to reender anything this

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,479
is purely just adjusting yeah the sensor

40
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,119
essentially on your camera and if you

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
hold down control uh I usually just snap

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
it to a minus two now back to the sky

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,719
settings so what this is uh yeah

44
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,200
essentially it's created the exact look

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,119
of the sky a real sunlamp that little

46
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,439
Sun disc over there and everything will

47
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,079
change depending on what you set like

48
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,200
the elevation right if you set it to be

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,399
like uh really low in the sky well

50
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,840
that's like Morning Line you can see

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,840
it's it's changed everything to be like

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,119
a warm look right so we got like really

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,840
warm light over everything and if you

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,800
change it to be like noon like the

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
sunlight is coming directly above it you

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,440
can see it's a lot colder and that's

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
because uh as the sunlight goes lower in

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
the sky it's now passing through more of

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
the atmosphere so it's like decaying the

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,239
light and you get um yeah you get like

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,000
an orangey look but as it goes more

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,720
vertical then it's a lot more clearer

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,959
and cleaner anyway it's a very cool

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,480
setting that is uh relatively relatively

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,000
new in blender um but yeah so I'm

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,920
actually going to leave it at the

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,239
default at around

68
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,400
15Â° um the one thing I will change

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,560
though is the sun size so you get like

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,640
really um yeah like clean hard Shadows

71
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,879
from the Sun and this sun size here the

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,599
reason for this very weird measurement

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,760
0.545 de is because it's actually the

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,800
real Sun size in relation to the Earth

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
but there are reasons for changing that

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,879
because if the sun goes through through

77
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,920
a cloud then obviously the cloud is now

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,959
lighting up and it's creating more of a

79
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,200
dispersed look so from the look of the

80
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
camera I usually just adjust this to be

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
like a two or a three and it just makes

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,799
the Sun a little bit softer around the

83
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,200
edges um and a little nicer at least

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,280
according to me awesome so looks better

85
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
but now we have another problem which is

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,319
that the Skylight is just bleeding in um

87
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,400
from from all directions right because

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,640
obviously it would so we need to create

89
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,959
an enclosure around it to obviously act

90
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,840
as an indoor space and just before we do

91
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,599
that though whilst I Was preparing for

92
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,080
this tutorial I noticed that the donuts

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,400
are a little close to my backsplash here

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,519
and that matters because uh we're going

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,040
to use depth of field later to make

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
things that behind it are like out of

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,000
focus but we can't really do that if

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,159
it's too close to the backsplash so I'm

99
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,080
just going to increase the distance

100
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,879
there and also just scale it up a little

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,079
bit because um now that it's in the

102
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,959
background

103
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,079
um yeah otherwise you'll see like the

104
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,599
corners actually appear in the render

105
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,400
which we which we don't want so just

106
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,319
make that a little bit bigger move it up

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,879
okay that's pretty good so essentially

108
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,799
yeah you just want to have like one two

109
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
3ish plate widths I think will do it uh

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,079
but yeah something like that and I also

111
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,519
now just want to make sure ah just

112
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,400
fiddling around with this now but yeah

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
this has got to be positioned exactly on

114
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,440
the plate as

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,840
well awesome okay so that enclosure

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
obviously to create that enclosure we

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
are going to be adding in a cube so

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,960
shift a mesh Cube and I want to scale

119
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,039
this down because although it is like a

120
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,320
kitchen right nothing outside of the

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,360
frame is going to be in the shot so

122
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,840
making it bigger than it needs to be is

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,160
just going to add to the render times

124
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
because then light has to bounce around

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,199
those things and yeah not good so um

126
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,280
yeah something scaled about that I don't

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
know something like that now uh really

128
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,919
what I want it to do is just like that

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,080
corner here I want it to be locked to

130
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,639
this point like I want to move it to

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
that point and previously in blender

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,039
this was a really fiddly process I would

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,320
have to tap G and then Zed move along

134
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,080
that and then try and time it here and

135
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,240
then H tap G and then Y and move it and

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
it would never be exactly correct it

137
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
would always just be slightly off well

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
now there is a new feature in blender

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,880
literally that came in this release 4.0

140
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
that has changed the game so there was a

141
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,039
bunch of uh snapping improvements so I

142
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,560
will show you them now so it's actually

143
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,000
easy to understand if you just go into

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,280
y-frame mode so if I tap G so I'm moving

145
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,639
my Cube uh if you hit B it now enters

146
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,560
you into a new state called snapping

147
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,080
mode so the first thing it's asking you

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
is uh what is the origin of the the

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
object that you're moving that you want

150
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,600
to be the snapping point so essentially

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
as I Mouse over this you can see the

152
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
cursor is changing when it's a circle

153
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
that means it's it it's uh going to snap

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
to that face if it is a Crosshair that's

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
that edge if it's a triangle that's the

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
middle point of the edge which is

157
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
sometimes useful and if it's a square

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,039
then that's a verticy so this is on the

159
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,080
object that is selected right now okay

160
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,599
so I obviously want that corner verticy

161
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,280
so I'm just going to do a single click

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,759
there now after I've clicked you can see

163
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,319
I'm able to select whichever point in

164
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,039
the rest of the scene I want to snap it

165
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,039
to so just like again it's a square when

166
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,800
it's a verticy so when I'm on these

167
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,479
faces here uh right there I'll do a

168
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,160
single click and there we go so you can

169
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,560
see it's perfectly aligned it uh with

170
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,840
the bottom of that uh that backsplash

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,560
there now it is it is a little weird

172
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll I'll be honest like maybe it's more

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,599
weird because I've been using blender

174
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:48,960
for so long maybe beginners find it a

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
little bit easier but yeah like the fact

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
that you're in a move State then you're

177
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,879
hitting B and you you you will be moving

178
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,280
it but it's in a snapping mode rather

179
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,440
than a a placement mode it is a little

180
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,400
weird and also just to make it even more

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,360
complicated you can hold down alt at any

182
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,800
point and then middle Mouse to uh drag

183
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,840
around cuz sometimes you want to snap

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
like that point uh but then you need to

185
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,160
select a point underneath an object so

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
you can hold down alt middle Mouse and

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
then uh find that point and snap it to

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
that so that's even weirder but I'm very

189
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
glad it's in there because it is great

190
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,120
but it is just like takes a little bit

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
to wrap your head around um but I will

192
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,120
continue using it actually so in face

193
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,360
select mode in edit mode um you can see

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,280
this is too high up so I can just uh I

195
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,039
mean I could try and place it like this

196
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,560
or I could hit B and then go this point

197
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,720
to that point same here g b this point

198
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,440
to that point yeah it's pretty pretty

199
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,840
useful I mean it doesn't have to be this

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
exact I mean this is just stuff that's

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,759
outside of the frame but uh but anyways

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
all right and I'll move this out so I do

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
need to create a little bit of space

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,159
here cuz the camera needs to sit here

205
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,400
obviously um so there needs to be a bit

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
of space there but if I move inside you

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,360
should see some flickering yay for

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,080
flickering the flickering is because uh

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
obviously the cube comes with six faces

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,520
but we've already got two planes right

211
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,479
here and we don't really need those

212
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
planes we could actually map a marble

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,479
texture to the cube but then you have to

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,120
deal with UV unwrapping and all that

215
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,879
stuff I find it's actually easier

216
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,639
sometimes to just work with planes um

217
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,759
and use that instead so instead with the

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,879
cube here I'm just going to remove the

219
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,840
two faces that I don't need so the back

220
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,880
face and then this bottom face so

221
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,640
selecting those two and then hit X which

222
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,760
is another way to delete and not

223
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,919
vertices that's what we've been doing

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,559
currently instead hit faces so it's just

225
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,839
deleting those faces so now you should

226
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,000
see you have um yeah just kind of like

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,680
an open box four sides and then the back

228
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
and the bottom um are open and now what

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,760
I need is an opening on the left hand

230
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,600
side to be that window so to do that I'm

231
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,640
going to cut into it so that I get a

232
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
little bit of Gap um here on the left

233
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,079
hand side to be like the gap between the

234
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,160
uh the wall and the window and then

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,399
another Gap here between um yeah the

236
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,680
bottom of the countertop and you know so

237
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to yeah inser and for that

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,040
tool it's I so I for inser and it's now

239
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,959
kind of like it's it's shrinking that

240
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,440
face into itself um and you're just like

241
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,680
choosing its scale essentially I'll hold

242
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,760
down shift to get a more precise uh

243
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,880
movement and yeah about there that's

244
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,680
pretty good and now I just delete that

245
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,800
face so again X and then faces awesome

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,079
so we should now see this which in

247
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,160
rended View mode whoops rended View mode

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,360
should hopefully look

249
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,160
okay yeah not bad um now this window

250
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,120
frame here really is just acting like

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,120
like the control for the light so if I

252
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,480
want I can much more precisely place

253
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,959
this like I don't want that much light

254
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,760
coming in um you know creating all that

255
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,519
light on this side of the the wall there

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,800
I can also say maybe I need more space

257
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
here so that I've got a little bit of

258
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Darkness so I could put some things uh

259
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,519
in the background without them falling

260
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,920
into light and then this bottom face

261
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,120
here sorry this bottom Edge this is

262
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,160
going to control where the light starts

263
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
in the scene right so if it's like all

264
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,440
the way down here then it's uh yeah

265
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,279
anyways you get the idea just sort of

266
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,200
shaping the light awesome and now with

267
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
the camera selected I'll just move this

268
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,040
down a little bit angle it

269
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,320
up there we

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
go Al I mean you can also just do this

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,279
in um uh fly mode shift tiller key but I

272
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,200
like hitting the uh R tool and then just

273
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
selecting the axes and I can just tilt

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
the camera exactly where I want it

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
awesome so much better we've we've

276
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,959
controlled the Skylight so the Skylight

277
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
is no longer coming in but we have

278
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
uncontrolled Lighting in the sense that

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
this wall here that's over here that is

280
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
supposed to represent the rest of the

281
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
kitchen is hitting and receiving all of

282
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,079
that sunlight light and it's just

283
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,399
filling in all of this space uh on the

284
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,399
right hand side and that's not good

285
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,920
because we want shadow shadow is

286
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,760
actually a good thing it helps reveal

287
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,880
form a lot of new artists like they get

288
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
scared of Shadow they're try and like

289
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
fill everything in and light everything

290
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,720
you do want shadow shadow is a good

291
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,639
thing so all this uncontrolled space is

292
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,800
not good so essentially we need to do um

293
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,959
just like what you would do in the real

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,600
world and that's to create a uh like

295
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,320
what a photographer do they make like a

296
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,839
a black fill card right and that's just

297
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,800
to essentially uh stop bounce lighting

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,920
um from hitting this object so it's a

299
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,720
good excuse to learn about a new feature

300
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,800
so with the cube selected if I go to the

301
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,200
materials and then hit new uh we're

302
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,560
going to keep the white material for

303
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
everything else right White Walls but

304
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,600
then I can add another material right

305
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
underneath this one by hitting the plus

306
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,279
button then adding another material and

307
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,360
I'll call this one black wall and I

308
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,920
actually will change the Shader from

309
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,360
Principal to a much simpler uh uh

310
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
diffuse it's just easier than like

311
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,639
easier for Cycles to calculate than a

312
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,440
full principled one and then this I'll

313
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
just change the color to be really dark

314
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
almost black all right and now in edit

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,600
mode I'm going to go face select and I'm

316
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,160
going to select that one wall that I

317
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,279
want to have uh the black wall material

318
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,040
to and then here I select it from the

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,199
material list black wall and then hit

320
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,079
assign and importantly you won't see the

321
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,040
assigned select these buttons they'll

322
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,920
only appear when you're in edit mode so

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,199
if you don't see it it's cuz you're not

324
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,800
in edit mode so in edit mode um select

325
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,680
the face then you'll see it and hit

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,360
assign and now look at that we have much

327
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,040
more control and in fact because this

328
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
light uh this uh sunlight is hitting

329
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,440
this uh this wall and it's currently

330
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,399
dark this color here now becomes almost

331
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,600
like the control for how much fill light

332
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
I want on the right hand side of the

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,399
donuts so the brighter it goes the more

334
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,880
fill light I get um yeah just a very

335
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
simple way to control that lighting a

336
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,360
bit better

337
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,440
awesome that's looking pretty good the

338
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,600
other thing I'm going to do is uh I'm

339
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,399
going to adjust the sun intensity so

340
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,120
there's a separate uh measurement here

341
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,920
just for intensity now you could like

342
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,320
you could drop the intensity of um the

343
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,680
whole Sky texture as well but when you

344
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,279
do that it also drops the sky texture

345
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,199
right um and so I found was like for a

346
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,399
while when the feature came out I was

347
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,760
like trying to it was very hard to

348
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
control um but I realized like if you

349
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,639
keep the strength at one but then you

350
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,120
reduce reduce the sun intensity um you

351
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,600
could like for example reduce the sun

352
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,720
intensity like by a lot and then

353
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
increase your uh exposure and then it's

354
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,760
like the sunlight is there but it's a

355
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,120
lot softer right it's not like so

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,000
overbearing um but essentially what I

357
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
want to do I'm going to set this sun

358
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,079
intensity to 0.5 so it's half of its

359
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,320
brightness but the sky texture has full

360
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,000
brightness so it's just a little um yeah

361
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
a little less hot

362
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,120
essentially awesome now two things I

363
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
will show you before before we close

364
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,160
this tutorial um which can be useful to

365
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,560
know one is how to import a model okay

366
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,079
because although as a beginner it's good

367
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,880
to understand modeling tools and know

368
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
how to build things uh when you start

369
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,160
building scenes it's very common

370
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,279
professional artists in studios to just

371
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,720
make use of model libraries because

372
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,320
there is so much you need to model and

373
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,240
basically fill in to create a realistic

374
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
believable scene it's just too much for

375
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,880
one artist to do so it's very common to

376
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
make use of model libraries

377
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,000
so what I want you to do is click the

378
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,839
link in the description and you will

379
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,600
find this model the wood utensils which

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
we're going to put in the background is

381
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,480
a free model and it's available in

382
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,839
multiple softwares the one we're looking

383
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,160
for is the blender file so hit download

384
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,320
on that and then just like before unzip

385
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,399
the file that you receive and inside it

386
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,279
you should see a bunch of textures and

387
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,720
then one do blend file then we're going

388
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
to go to file you would think import but

389
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
actually this is for um external file

390
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,199
extensions like not blend files if you

391
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,399
want to import a blend file it's

392
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,440
actually the append option okay so now

393
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,880
we select that blend file double click

394
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
it and now we're actually reading the

395
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
blend file we're reading the information

396
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,680
inside that blend file and it's saying

397
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
what do you want to import do you want

398
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,600
to import just a single object from that

399
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
blend file do you want to import uh you

400
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,880
know a texture or a material perhaps but

401
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,920
in a lot of cases if it's just a blend

402
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
file that contains like one model it's

403
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,319
often going to in a collection a single

404
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,120
collection so go into collection and

405
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,839
then just click the one that's there and

406
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,279
then hit append and now even though

407
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,040
there is multiple objects as part of

408
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,160
this um it's just brought in all of them

409
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,480
and it's put it into a collection

410
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,160
already utensils jar

411
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,199
001 so now I'm just going to move this

412
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,399
into the back of my scene and that's it

413
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,199
so that's how to import data from one

414
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,720
blend file into another it's going a

415
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,959
little slow for me I'm going to move

416
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
that there we go so I just want it yeah

417
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,399
somewhere in the background like that

418
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,560
the other thing I want to show you how

419
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
to do is how to install an add-on

420
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,240
because although you might think that's

421
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,199
kind of like an advanced user thing you

422
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,199
will very quickly realize that a lot of

423
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,199
workflows rely on add-ons so add-ons are

424
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,560
very powerful and there's a lot of them

425
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,519
out there and it's not actually clear

426
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,839
how to install add-ons to beginners so I

427
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
thought I would include that so

428
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,240
obviously we're going to use the uh the

429
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
polygon add-on I mentioned this uh this

430
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,639
earlier it just lets you like download

431
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,680
and import objects with uh with one

432
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,959
click and there's a bunch of free models

433
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,920
in here as well well so you can actually

434
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,560
get started with those and and do some

435
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,839
interesting things click the link in the

436
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,120
description this will take you to the

437
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
download page and you just looking to

438
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,440
download that great so you can see it's

439
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,120
uh downloaded a single zip file and

440
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,920
importantly you do not want to unzip

441
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,839
that zip file and the reason is is that

442
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,600
blender installs add-ons from the zip

443
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
file that is unextracted so to install

444
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,399
an add-on you go to edit preferences

445
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,319
add-ons and then at the top click on

446
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,440
install then Loc where you downloaded

447
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
the zip file just that there and then

448
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,199
you just hit install and now if it's

449
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,959
correct if it's like found and located

450
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,760
uh and add-on inside that zip file it

451
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,240
should then automatically take you to

452
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,880
the name of that add-on uh in the search

453
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,319
so you just have it there and then to

454
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,439
enable it you just do a single click to

455
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,199
check it and it's now enabled now

456
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,559
obviously every atom will have a

457
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,280
different way of accessing it but

458
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,319
commonly they are in the sidebar which

459
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,959
is exactly where the polygon one is so

460
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,000
you'll see the tab here they might

461
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
actually be changing the sidebar some

462
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,520
point in the future but for now this is

463
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,000
uh anyway how it is um so then just go

464
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,919
login via browser it's going to take you

465
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,760
to the website it'll say login confirmed

466
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
return back to the add-on uh and you can

467
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,960
type in free and you can see um a whole

468
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,520
bunch of different assets there so

469
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,120
actually one that I will uh import if I

470
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,039
go to my model section and then go to

471
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,400
vegetation there's a bunch of different

472
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,679
plants here um there's like four free

473
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
ones I believe so you can use one of

474
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,400
those I'm going to be using a paid one

475
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
just this uh SP one I thought looked

476
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,720
quite nice but yeah you can access one

477
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
of these these free ones if you want to

478
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,600
and there we go awesome so this is our

479
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,039
render we are nearing the Finish Line I

480
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,400
can feel it we're getting close so join

481
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,559
me in the next part we're going to dive

482
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,280
into the composition and then animation

483
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,159
and then the final render so click here

484
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,080
and I'll see you there
