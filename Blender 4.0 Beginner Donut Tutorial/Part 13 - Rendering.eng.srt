1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,120
we've got the donuts we've got the

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,120
animation now it's time to do our final

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,599
lovely

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,320
render so we are rendering using the

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,480
Cycles rendering engine which to jog

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,119
your memory from the uh rendering video

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,960
the way it works is turning off D noise

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
is it starts with a very noisy image

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,439
with a low sample count and then over

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,160
time you can see in the top left there

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,080
it throws more samples at it and it

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,640
refines that image to be uh cleaner and

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,120
cleaner essentially so if we were to set

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,559
this uh maximum sample count to a really

15
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,239
absurdly low value like say 10 samples

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,480
you can see it renders very quickly

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,000
right it's done almost instantaneously

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,440
but it's so noisy that you can't see any

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,160
of the detail now there is the magical D

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,719
noise function which we will be using

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,320
however that is not it it does solve a

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,920
lot it's definitely definitely helpful

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,079
but it's not perfect especially for

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,000
animations because on each frame the

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,599
sample variation um even though it's set

26
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,320
to be stable um there will be variances

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,560
frameo frame so if you're using a low

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,159
sample count this Aid noiser it will do

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,360
its best but it'll still have like

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,479
splotchy patterns that will appear and

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,880
you can actually notice it if you go

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,520
looking for it um like the other day I

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,720
was watching one of uh Mr BEAST's videos

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,360
and there was like an animation in it

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
and I was looking at and I saw like all

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
this splotchy stuff like in on the sides

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
and I was like oh damn that must be on

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,520
like a really tight deadline cuz they

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,960
did not have time to render out uh the

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
proper the proper samples um but anyways

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,240
so I did a few tests for this exact

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,200
scene here um you can see this is with

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,280
20 samples you zoom into the background

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,799
there you can see splotchiness it's um

45
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,799
especially noticeable in out of focus

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,799
areas which I'll show you how to do that

47
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,920
out of focusness soon um but you can see

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
it's very splotchy and you wouldn't ever

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,320
want to use it 50 starts to look a

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
little more stable but still the

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,960
splotchiness is very noticeable you

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,600
don't want that 100 this is where it's

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,479
starting to look usable but still not

54
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,360
great I wouldn't consider that good 300

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,480
samples is where I consider the uh the

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
bare minimum for a scene like this but

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
ideally you would be able to go up to

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
500 samples which is where a lot of that

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,720
splotchiness is so negligible that you

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,560
don't really notice it and if you have

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
time or you don't mind rendering you

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,239
know overnight or something like that or

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,840
maybe a couple of overnights a thousand

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,879
samples will get you an even cleaner

65
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,840
looking result so for my Max sample

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,040
amount I'm going to go with 500 and by

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
the way there is viewport and there is

68
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,879
render and these settings are identical

69
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,360
um I was tweaking viewport before

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
because I was showing you uh in the

71
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,560
viewport but obviously it's what's in

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,040
the render settings which is going to be

73
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,159
saved into your final uh animation there

74
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,959
is also noise threshold also known as

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,080
adaptive sampling and the way this works

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,879
is it will try to look at the image and

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,159
determine which areas are already clean

78
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,159
enough and then which areas need more

79
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,760
samples like dark areas where there's

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
not enough light or something and it'll

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,159
throw more samples specifically into

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,519
that area and it's very efficient and I

83
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,840
would love to use it unfortunately it

84
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,200
doesn't play well with the denoiser with

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,319
the denoiser it can create splotchy

86
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,280
areas which are not good obviously so if

87
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
you're using the denoiser which let's

88
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,159
face it is probably 99% of the time then

89
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,239
you can't really use the noise Threshold

90
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,760
at least as far as I've seen I haven't

91
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,159
seen it work uh reliably enough so

92
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,519
uncheck noise threshold samples I went

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,879
with 500 try to go yeah if you're on a

94
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,680
laptop maybe 300 but try to go uh up

95
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,159
from there and you'll get a nice a clean

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,439
result there's also time limit I almost

97
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,480
never use this but this just puts like a

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,799
cap on each frame so if I don't know the

99
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,280
samples was going to take the image like

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,760
25 seconds to render if you set your

101
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,879
your time limit to be 20 seconds it

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
would just stop at whatever uh sample

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
count 20 seconds gives it and then it

104
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
would move on to the next frame but as I

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,079
said I almost never use it I just want

106
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,360
to use the exact sample count awesome

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,239
now you might remember previously um

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
that when you want to do a render you go

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
render render image or you hit F12 and

110
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,840
then this will kick off a single still

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
render and then from here if I wanted to

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
save this image I would go image save as

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
well what we want to do is we want to

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,199
render a sequence like a you know as

115
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,919
every single frame um and so to do that

116
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,320
we want to use not just render but

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,479
render

118
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,800
animation and when you do that it will

119
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,520
use and it will save the file for you in

120
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,880
whatever you put in the output settings

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
over here so if we bring this out over

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,919
here uh you can see your resolutions

123
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,560
defined up there you got your frame rate

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
yada yada the output one here so this is

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,039
the folder where it's going to save the

126
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,400
file to and then your file format I'll

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
just move this up um this is a really

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,680
important one now you would think that

129
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,840
because we want to create a video file

130
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,240
right that you could upload to Instagram

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,720
or YouTube or whatever that you would

132
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,240
want to use one of these movie settings

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,199
maybe an AVI or an FFM Peg or something

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,400
like that

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
but you would not you would be wrong but

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,000
it's a common uh mistake a lot of

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,880
beginners make the reason you don't want

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
to ever ever render a scene directly

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
into this format is that if if at any

140
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,440
point during the uh rendering process

141
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,039
your computer was to crash or let's face

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,680
it Windows was to do another update

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
overnight and you can never figure out

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,639
when it's going to do it and it just

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
does it randomly and you anyways uh if

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,759
it was to do that you would lose

147
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,120
everything everything you have rendered

148
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
has just vanished because it will not

149
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,759
have created any file that you can

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,520
actually read so instead you always

151
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,319
render to still images okay so you want

152
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,039
every single one of these frames to

153
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,280
create a PNG and then put it into the

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,199
output folder there which you will then

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,919
later take that sequence of 300 PNG

156
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,800
images let's say or it's 160 in this

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
case um and then put that into another

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,639
process which I'll show you to uh to

159
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,960
create that final video file so PNG is

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,639
actually pretty good for most cases uh

161
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,360
if you want to go a slightly higher

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,599
quality you could use Tiff if you really

163
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:08,639
know what you're doing you could use

164
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,919
open exr but the problem with that is

165
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,400
that it will not use uh it won't embed

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,319
like a display uh transform in it so

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
it'll save it into linear format

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
technical jargon just to say it's going

169
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,560
to look terrible if you don't know what

170
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,280
you're doing with it so generally

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
speaking uh PNG or or Tiff is the one

172
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
you want never jpeg the compression on

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,520
that is terrible unless you're just you

174
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,160
know throwing a still image up on

175
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,919
Facebook or something uh but PNG or Tiff

176
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,840
that's fine and the color depth uh you

177
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,520
could go8 or 16 bits 16 bits will give

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
you a lot more range but it will be

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,400
larger files um unless you're planning

180
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
to do color grading and something like

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
after effect or nuke or something I

182
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,520
wouldn't bother with 16bit 8 should be

183
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,680
fine so you set your output folder to be

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,960
something that makes sense I usually

185
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,720
just create a folder called uh frames uh

186
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
and then within here I just create

187
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
another sub folder I call it like one um

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
just because you almost always need to

189
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,560
render multiple times but anyways you

190
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,039
you you create a sub folder there called

191
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,879
one um and then yeah I just kick off uh

192
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,759
the render by going render animation but

193
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,879
before you do that it is a good idea to

194
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,520
check your scene to make sure that you

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
haven't got any mistakes because you're

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,400
going to be rendering and usually you're

197
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
rendering overnight or maybe a sequence

198
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
of days and you don't want to have to go

199
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
through the whole process of rendering

200
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,080
only to bring it up and then go like oh

201
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,360
crap I forgot to turn on that layer or I

202
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
forgot to fix that problem or I didn't

203
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,039
notice this before I did the render and

204
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,240
then you have to do the whole thing all

205
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,720
over again so here's a checklist first

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,479
in solid View mode click this little

207
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,319
drop down next to your viewport overlays

208
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,560
and then go face orientation now what

209
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,199
this is showing you is which faces are

210
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,440
facing the correct direction so the face

211
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,159
is the solid part of the mesh and it's

212
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,680
like paper thin right but there is a

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,319
correct direction and there is a wrong

214
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,720
direction so the correct direction is is

215
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
the direction that the the camera and

216
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,039
the Shader expects to see and it can

217
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,000
render correctly if it's showing you the

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,639
opposite side of the face it means that

219
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,080
the shading is likely to get screwed up

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,159
so if you see anything in your scene

221
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,840
that is red it means that it is facing

222
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,520
the wrong direction okay so in this case

223
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,039
it thought that the kitchen should be

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,639
rendered outside right because it was a

225
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,440
cube that we started with so it puts the

226
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
faces outside it cuz it wouldn't know

227
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,319
that we want to render inside it so in

228
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,400
this case if you have a red face like

229
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,840
this you select it select everything on

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,799
the mesh just by tapping a and then you

231
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,360
want to hit shift n okay now that should

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
fix it if it doesn't because on the case

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,559
you want to have it facing uh inwards

234
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159
like in this case uh this little

235
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,240
recalculate normals box here if you

236
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
click that you can then click the check

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,560
boox that says inside or a hotkey for it

238
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
is control shiftn and that will do a

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,120
recalculation uh inside anyways long

240
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,200
story short you just want to make sure

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
that everything you see is blue if

242
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
you've got anything a Sprinkle or you

243
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,920
know a donut or a plate or anything like

244
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,519
that just make sure everything is

245
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,519
showing up as blue um because that's

246
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,320
very important all right so now that's

247
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
done I can turn that off the other thing

248
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,079
that you want to check is that you

249
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,519
haven't got any Rogue uh objects that

250
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,839
will be showing up in the render that

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,279
you don't want to be there like for

252
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,680
example this weird looking little UFO

253
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,720
thing right these little sprinkles that

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
are just hovering off into space here so

255
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
that is because we've got some sprinkles

256
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
which are being referenced on our

257
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,760
geometry node stack but we don't want

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
these individual ones which are being

259
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,279
referenced to appear in the render so on

260
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,120
the sprinkles collection I'm just going

261
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,800
to uncheck this little camera icon and

262
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,920
that means it's viewable in the viewport

263
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
but it's not going to appear in the

264
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,959
render this will not affect the objects

265
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,880
over here when it's referenced in a

266
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
geometry node system it's just going to

267
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,519
treat that as its own separate thing and

268
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,160
it's not going to uh hide it from the

269
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,519
render but it just means that these five

270
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,920
little reference sprinkles will be

271
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,959
invisible in the render the other thing

272
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,959
that you want to check is is to look at

273
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,440
your intersections okay because looking

274
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
at my donut look at that wow I've got a

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
massive intersection and this would be

276
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
noticeable because the camera is now

277
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,760
moving and it is above it right so you

278
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
don't want to have uh intersections so

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm actually going to use this as an

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,440
excuse to uh slightly reorient um my

281
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,120
donuts and create a much more appealing

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
looking stack cuz I was experimenting

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,040
before I hit the record button and I

284
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,320
thought if I just create you know both

285
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
of these stacks so they're kind of like

286
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
leaning on each other then I rotate them

287
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
a little bit like this then I take this

288
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
donut I could move it out rotate

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,680
that something like

290
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,600
this there we go right and then oh

291
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,680
yeah I'll rotate this a little bit more

292
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,639
it's a leaning tower of

293
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,440
Donuts I'll move that out a little

294
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,279
bit but really with this many many

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,560
objects on top of each other you're

296
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
bound to have something that looks a

297
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,839
little funky so just look at it from

298
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,320
different angles I mean the most

299
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
important one is the camera right making

300
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
sure that it is uh sensible but because

301
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
we've got a moving camera it kind of has

302
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
to look good from multiple angles um the

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
other thing I noticed also is uh it

304
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,880
would look a lot better if I could see

305
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,000
the top of this dut here so I noticed if

306
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,600
I select this stack and I rotate it like

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,240
this almost like it's on the edge of

308
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,680
that plate there like the lip and it's

309
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,040
kind of leaning this way it looks a lot

310
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
nicer yeah see now I can see the top of

311
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,200
that donut and uh yeah just feels a lot

312
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,399
nicer might actually rotate a little bit

313
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
further and then I'll move it

314
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
up rotate this

315
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,160
one I'll pull that in a little

316
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,440
bit and that's pretty good that's not

317
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,079
bad all right there so that's a lot more

318
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,959
interesting and I've also corrected a

319
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,360
lot of the inter sections there but you

320
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,200
know as I mentioned before guys this is

321
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,839
a tutorial and I can't fix everything

322
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,240
whilst I'm uh running the tutorial so uh

323
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,120
have a look at your scene and have a

324
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
look at you know the plate is there a

325
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,920
doughnut which is hovering above the

326
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,399
plate like it is here make sure that

327
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,959
it's not or at least make sure that it

328
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,519
is not in a place that's noticeable um

329
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,560
because that will not be good and you'll

330
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,639
be on I mean I actually finished the

331
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,399
final animation sequence uh for this

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,440
tutorial and then notice right at the

333
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,519
end uh that one of the donuts was like

334
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,440
this and I just didn't notice it right

335
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,519
until I did uh after the uh the render

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,079
sequence was complete and actually a

337
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,519
co-worker of mine was also working on

338
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,519
the scene helping render some uh extra

339
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,800
sequences and he didn't notice it either

340
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,360
and we're both like damn how did we miss

341
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,120
that cuz you just don't go looking for

342
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
it so I'm calling it out now cuz I'm

343
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,959
sure a lot of you watching have got

344
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,920
intersections and uh it's good to try to

345
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
fix it now another one to check for is

346
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
your lighting and your Expos exposure

347
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,519
ranges so first thing I know is that

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,839
looking at this is this is good it's

349
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,120
putting a lot of the attention on the

350
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,959
donuts which is great but this uh

351
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,880
everything here in the background is

352
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
just it's so dark it's almost hard to

353
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,199
see and it feels a little bit too moody

354
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,440
right it's almost like a Rembrant uh

355
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,160
painting or something like that I want

356
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,959
it to feel a little lighter a little bit

357
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,040
more uh friendly so on the roof here on

358
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,880
the ceiling of my kitchen I'm going to

359
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,959
shift and then right click to put my 3

360
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,680
cursor there and then right at that

361
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,120
point I'm going to add in an area lamp

362
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
and I'm just going to move it down

363
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
slightly just to make sure it's not

364
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,680
clipping through the surface um and then

365
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,800
yeah let's go look in this so this is

366
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
what it is with it off and then if I

367
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,720
just increase this you can see it's just

368
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,399
adding a little bit of fill light to the

369
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,399
whole scene to just feel a little bit

370
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,440
lighter um and a little less uh yeah

371
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,279
extreme in its uh light choice but yeah

372
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,560
that looks pretty good now by the way

373
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,320
this power value there's something

374
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,959
called the inverse Square law that

375
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,639
applies to all lights in the real world

376
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
and in 3D software it just means that if

377
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,279
something is double like twice as close

378
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,680
to something it means it's going to be

379
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,279
four times as bright so what this means

380
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,880
is that I've just added in a an area

381
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,279
lamp right at the top of my ceiling but

382
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,120
that's because this is just the size of

383
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,320
the box that I've got if yours is a

384
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
little bit uh shorter than this right

385
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,320
then when you placed it then this lamp

386
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
and this lamp energy that we've just

387
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
defined here as you know 10 watts it's

388
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,720
going to be a lot brighter so don't copy

389
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,440
the values that I'm putting here have a

390
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,160
look at your scene and try to evaluate

391
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,000
and go is it bright enough is it too

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,199
bright do I feel that this fill light is

393
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,560
too overpowering right or is it

394
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,880
underpowering just evaluate and try to

395
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,759
do it um as fairly as you can and

396
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,240
something that I recommend um and this I

397
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,839
do uh a lot of the time for a lot of

398
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,600
final renders is underneath your color

399
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,759
management if you go to view transform

400
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,800
change it from agx to false color H now

401
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
this obviously you never want to do for

402
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
a final render but this is revealing to

403
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,759
you what is the exposure range of

404
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,639
different parts of the image kind of

405
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,040
like if you're using a camera and it's

406
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,279
got like a zebra thing to like show you

407
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,240
which parts are clipping this is like

408
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
that but it's like to an advanced level

409
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,480
essentially it's showing you I mean I'll

410
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,639
put this up from the blender

411
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,360
documentation but it's showing you what

412
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
is the exposure range of which parts of

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
the image and there's no like right or

414
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,160
wrong here but generally speaking you

415
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,120
want to have a nice range because then

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
it's showing there are parts that are in

417
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
light and then there are parts that are

418
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,279
in Shadows and there is a range there so

419
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,000
that you can reveal the form there are

420
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,639
exceptions to it but generally that's

421
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,079
the idea now in my case I want to make

422
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
sure that um really there's very few

423
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,920
areas that are in the red or the white

424
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,680
the white means there is actually no

425
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,639
information there because it has clipped

426
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,040
so that is not good it's okay for a few

427
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,519
areas right where there's a few

428
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,000
highlights but generally speaking you

429
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
don't want too much now in my case I

430
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,560
think it's a little bit too high so I'm

431
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,519
just dialing it back and just so that I

432
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
get most of you know the part of the

433
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
donut where it's hitting the light um

434
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,800
it's mostly in the orange to Yellow

435
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,519
range with a very small amounts of um

436
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,240
yeah red or white coming through so once

437
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,519
I'm happy with that make sure you change

438
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,120
it back to agx otherwise you'll be

439
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
rendering to false color and that will

440
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
look horrible a few other aesthetic

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,480
choices I noticed that the pink was a

442
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,199
little bit too hot the saturation does

443
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,800
make a difference so I'm just going to

444
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,920
dial it back to around about a 6 value I

445
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,600
also noticed that this yellow color was

446
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,079
a little bit too close to mustard so I'm

447
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,440
just going to tweak the Hue here just to

448
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,319
make it a little bit more exciting kind

449
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:39,920
of like a banana yellow right and a

450
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
little bit brighter as well just a

451
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,160
little bit more cheerful the blue I'm

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,680
going to make a little closer to an aqua

453
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,880
which is a little more funky a little I

454
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,360
don't know more interesting at least to

455
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,959
me uh the base color oh yeah this one

456
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,240
here so I decided after looking at this

457
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
and evaluating it I'm like I should just

458
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,560
go with the the white icing like what I

459
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,920
had in my uh my final render so just

460
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,520
creating a new material call it white

461
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,359
icing right um and also for the doughnut

462
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,959
I noticed I forgot to put subsurface

463
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,240
scattering on the doughnut itself um

464
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,839
because doughnut although it's bread

465
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
right it's not going to have as much

466
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,240
subsurface scattering as the icing but

467
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,280
it will have some right so I'm going to

468
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,720
give it a weight of one uh radius make

469
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,319
sure that's always set to one and then

470
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,439
this value here let's go

471
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,319
01 um like that which I think is

472
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,440
actually more than the icing we gave it

473
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
but anyways it works because it's kind

474
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,760
of doughy um we can kind of get away

475
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,960
maybe maybe we having second thoughts

476
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
right now uh yeah we got Point 01 why

477
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
not make it look a little bit more

478
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,960
stylized and uh cartoonish the other

479
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,080
thing that I can see looking at this is

480
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
that this part here right with these

481
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
ball sprinkles on it is it's very like

482
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
high frequency detail which is just like

483
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
a technical term to mean like small

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
detail artists always invent terms just

485
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,679
to sound uh smarter than they are but it

486
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,960
looks high frequency right and it's a

487
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
little too high frequency it's good to

488
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880
have some small detail but not that

489
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
small it's just uh it's kind of gritty

490
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
and it's kind of like it's sticking out

491
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,200
like a sore thumb to me so what I'm

492
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,320
going to do is go to my geometry nose

493
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
setup just for my round sprinkles here

494
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,159
um and by the way also make sure you

495
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,640
you're looking at the correct one not

496
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,320
long sprinkles uncheck that little pin

497
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,840
if you've got it like I did um and then

498
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm going to change the round sprinkle

499
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
scale dragging down to

500
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,559
1.5 so it's a lot bigger which means I

501
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,200
can use a different distance Min

502
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,840
value

503
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,440
002 and whilst I'm here um I'm also

504
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,360
going to change the distance value for

505
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,799
the long sprinkles cuz I noticed it was

506
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
feeling a little too even the

507
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,280
distribution of these which generally

508
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,039
means that with this pron disc

509
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,520
distribution it's using the distance to

510
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,400
make sure they're all perfectly evenly

511
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
spaced and it's a little bit it's it's

512
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
too big essentially so I'm going to set

513
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,440
this to 0.4 instead which means you will

514
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,720
have some overlaps and some clipping but

515
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,960
if we use a lower count here in our

516
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,240
setup like 80 for example or even lower

517
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,400
right it should feel a lot more natural

518
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
right it doesn't look like like before

519
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,840
it was like 200 um when it was uh you

520
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
know this was 06 and now it's like 30

521
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,360
but it still almost feels like the same

522
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,720
as what it was before because that

523
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,200
distance when you lower it you're

524
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
getting more sprinkles in there even

525
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,559
though it's a lower sprinkle density

526
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,320
anyways technical uh also lower this one

527
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,080
cuz that's just too many so let's go

528
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,360
like 50 for that um and that's pretty

529
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,559
good you can also experiment like I

530
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,559
tried changing the different um um like

531
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,480
whether this one has long sprinkles or

532
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,440
whether this one at the top has round

533
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,080
you can play around with these I went uh

534
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,480
I think the bottom one I gave long this

535
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,960
one I'm going to turn it off so none

536
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
no sprinkles on that one and just try

537
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
and get a nice you know feel for it

538
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,559
really you're just trying to go for

539
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,799
something that looks a little balanced

540
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,120
in its detail so you don't have too much

541
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,320
repetition um across it so I'm trying to

542
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,159
get a nice breakup of like round long

543
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,280
nun none round you know Etc the other

544
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,320
thing since we're talking about detail

545
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,880
is looking at this right this is small

546
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,480
detail this is small detail these shapes

547
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,600
here right this is large detail Okay so

548
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,679
we've got large and we've got this small

549
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,360
detail we don't have any medium detail

550
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,320
um and it's good to have a variance

551
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,919
across the scene just I don't know it's

552
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,880
one of the design rules it just helps

553
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,080
things feel a little bit more

554
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
aesthetically pleasing so uh something I

555
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,919
I saw when I was looking on Pinterest

556
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,400
many years ago uh for one of the old

557
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
Donut series was like uh you can put

558
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,679
bigger sprinkles like a few big chunky

559
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,480
sprinkles on it and uh it just adds

560
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,360
variance to it and it just makes it look

561
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
a lot more appealing so for that I'm you

562
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,360
could do it using geometry nodes but I

563
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,320
just do it by hand placing like three

564
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,679
sprinkles so on this donut here shift

565
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,720
right clicking on this part of the donut

566
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
uh I'll go into uh here we go solid View

567
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
mode and then shift a and then I'm going

568
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,400
to add in a UV sphere default settings

569
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,200
are okay just going to scale it

570
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,559
down like that right so this is the size

571
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,480
of the sprinkle quite big you could

572
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,960
imagine it almost as like a gumball or

573
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
something um it's probably not big

574
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
enough to be a gumball but you know what

575
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,120
I mean like something big right make

576
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,919
sure you're using shade smooth and for

577
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,840
the

578
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,760
material um sorry if this is like

579
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,360
getting to in the weeds but a lot of

580
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,880
people when they're following tutorials

581
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,320
they like to know the exact settings

582
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,240
that I used so I'm trying to show them

583
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,840
all um whilst not taking too long um but

584
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,960
yeah there we go so I go for like a aqua

585
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,120
color yeah like that and then I want to

586
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,840
turn the roughness like like all the way

587
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,320
down like that cool and now I just need

588
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
to duplicate that sprinkle so duplicate

589
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
here uh I'll pull it out and I'm just

590
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,400
going to go with three you could go for

591
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,520
more but I'm just going to go with three

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,480
and I'm only going to put it on this dut

593
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm not going to bother with the others

594
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,559
I'm going to say this is the special one

595
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,039
this is the one that we want your eye to

596
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,640
be drawn to so this is the one with a

597
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,400
little bit more detail than the others

598
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,919
I'm sorry if I'm doing a horrible

599
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,720
zigzaggy job of I could do snapping but

600
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm like eh it's just too much work to

601
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,679
the snapping functions for this so I'm

602
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,000
going to select those three shift select

603
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
the icing contrl p and then go keep

604
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
transform there we go so now they're all

605
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,320
attached to that just in case I move the

606
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,720
donut it's uh it's correctly uh done the

607
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,279
final thing I think I changed was the

608
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,520
world settings underneath the air and

609
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,919
dust for our Sky texture I just dialed

610
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,240
it back to around about a 7 just a

611
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,520
little bit cooler in the lighting right

612
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,600
as I might remember I told you if you go

613
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,520
all the way there it's like the sky just

614
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,400
becomes like blue um and if it's too far

615
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,440
up then it becomes yellow and orange or

616
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,640
whatever like kind of too decayed but

617
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,279
you know like a 7ish it'll just look it

618
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,919
just feels a little cleaner um in

619
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,039
comparison to what it was awesome now

620
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,760
we're F we're almost there I promise you

621
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,480
we're almost there the one thing that

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,360
you probably do want to know how to add

623
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,080
is depth of field it adds a lot because

624
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
every single camera in the real world

625
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,760
has depth of field except for pinhole

626
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,520
cameras interestingly because there is

627
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,400
no Optics in a pinhole camera so it can

628
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,279
have like infinite depth of field

629
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,240
supposedly um anyways the uh the depth

630
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
of field settings is underneath your

631
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,520
camera okay so select your camera then

632
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,000
click on the data here and then depth of

633
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
field right at the bottom so check that

634
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,799
box and everything will become blurry

635
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,760
because it doesn't have a focus object

636
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,520
yet so click the little ey dropper tool

637
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,720
and then just click on this icing this

638
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,559
uh pink doughnut icing right in the the

639
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,320
front here and there you go so that is

640
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,080
depth of field used to be really

641
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
difficult to do in blender um I started

642
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,679
like you know 20 years ago and it was

643
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,400
this horrible like motion blow thing you

644
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
had to do for the camera to like rotate

645
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,919
it anyway it's it's it's just a checkbox

646
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,320
now it's it's fascinating anyways uh the

647
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,760
f- stop if you're unfamiliar with

648
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,720
cameras the lower the F stop the

649
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,440
shallower that depth of field so you can

650
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,279
see very little of this image is

651
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,840
actually in Focus so it's actually good

652
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,279
for like Miniatures um but if you want

653
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
more of the scene to be in Focus like

654
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,080
you want more of this donut stack to be

655
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,159
seen I would go with an F stop somewhere

656
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,919
between six or eight um you know

657
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,880
something around the range I think I

658
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,840
went with eight for my final one or

659
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,200
maybe it was six can't remember anyways

660
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,159
but you can see the stuff in the

661
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
background there is now out of focus and

662
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
it puts the attention where it should be

663
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,159
right on those donuts in the middle

664
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:45,640
there and the other thing that I always

665
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,440
forget to enable is motion blur so

666
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,320
underneath your render settings here uh

667
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,679
you just need to check motion blur and I

668
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,399
actually find the default setting is

669
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,799
usually fine it's a little smooth like a

670
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,840
it's a a little bit too blurry sometimes

671
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,559
so you might want to drop it to like 04

672
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,399
or something but I don't know it should

673
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,159
be defined with a default it usually

674
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,399
looks okay so are we ready to render our

675
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:12,480
final animation well I actually thought

676
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,399
yes so that little jump cut that you saw

677
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,880
there was me going yep let's render that

678
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,240
animation and then I rendered it out and

679
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,640
then I came back and I went wait a

680
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,320
minute I've made some

681
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,799
errors now can you tell what they are I

682
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,440
will give you a

683
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,480
clue right here right here right here

684
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,919
we're missing those three little balls

685
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,440
that we created little sprinkles and

686
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
then also look in the background here

687
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
mysteriously dark almost as if the area

688
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,880
lamp that we added is not there so I'll

689
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,600
first of all say it's very common to do

690
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
this you think that you're finally ready

691
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,600
like yeah everything looks good kick off

692
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,159
the final uh animation I've I've

693
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,279
sometimes waited like over a week for a

694
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,320
whole animation to finish and then I

695
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,279
come back and then I open it up and then

696
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,240
I go oh no I forgot to turn off that

697
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,760
layer I forgot to turn on that layer I

698
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,720
forgot you know actually a technique

699
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,919
that Pixar uses um I learned at one of

700
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,039
the uh sigraph presentations they did

701
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
they said they render the first frame

702
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,640
the middle frame and the end frame of

703
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,240
every shot before they do the full

704
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,080
animation uh sequence uh because that

705
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,320
usually reveals any problems um in the

706
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,200
animation which they can then uh correct

707
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
so I should have done that but didn't um

708
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,960
anyways what was my mistake well when we

709
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,919
uh disabled this sprinkles collection

710
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,720
right we disabled it from appearing in

711
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,840
the render that's fine but when we

712
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,480
created these objects I didn't check

713
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,600
what was the active collection so when

714
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,399
you add a new object it adds it to

715
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,480
whatever is the selected collection this

716
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
little one with the little uh box around

717
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,559
it so obviously it put it inside of that

718
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,840
collection so these spheres should not

719
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,600
be inside the sprinkles so I'm going to

720
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,240
drag it out into a duts uh collection

721
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,559
which is where it should be and then

722
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,679
this area lamp as well that's the reason

723
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,880
that the uh the background is dark um is

724
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,399
cuz that was inside the sprinkle so it

725
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,679
was hidden from the rendler as well so

726
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
now putting that into the environment

727
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,919
that now should look a lot better so do

728
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,200
a test render just by hitting F12 see

729
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,279
how that looks first what I should have

730
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,480
done I mean even just doing one render

731
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
could have revealed this problem it's

732
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,440
that obvious um but do a test render

733
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,799
check look we've got the balls appearing

734
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,120
The Fill light is now in the background

735
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,520
and the other thing I noticed and this

736
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,000
is because it's the next day that I'm

737
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,720
recording this um when you look at

738
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,480
something with fresh eyes you often

739
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,000
notice different things so I thought

740
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
that this exposure looked pretty good

741
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
but then now having a look at it um the

742
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
next day I can see that it's a little

743
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,360
Overexposed okay so if you look uh at

744
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,519
the false color this is what it looks

745
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,919
like and there's just too much orange

746
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,440
there so essentially I'm going to drop

747
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,960
this back to be so it's like mostly

748
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,000
yellow across the uh the front of these

749
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,960
Donuts here well not mostly yellow but

750
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,600
more yellow than what there was uh

751
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,360
before there's not really an exact way

752
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,399
to sort of uh pinpoint it but I could

753
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,279
just tell it's a little Overexposed so

754
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,039
I'm just dialing it back to be a little

755
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,279
more reasonable again your exposure

756
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,679
ranges might be different depending on

757
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,240
you know how close your Donuts are to

758
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,640
the window or something but look at it

759
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,760
with your own eyes and if it looks wrong

760
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,240
when you're using this exposure range

761
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,399
use a different value tweak it and try

762
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,600
to make it um look accurate cuz actually

763
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
I was on Discord this morning looking at

764
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,039
some of your renders join the Discord if

765
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,720
you're not on there um and I was like

766
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
okay a lot of people also have

767
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
Overexposed uh renders so I should bring

768
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,440
that up anyway we are now finally ready

769
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
to do a render so again I am using no

770
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,279
noise threshold 500 samples probably get

771
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
that up to a th000 if you want it to be

772
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,200
non- jittery D noise open image D noise

773
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
and then I'm outputting it to tiffs just

774
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,799
RGB we don't need alpha 8 bit and then

775
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,159
I'm just putting it into a folder which

776
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,919
because I made a mistake uh I'm going to

777
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,440
put it into another F actually made two

778
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,720
mistakes rendered it

779
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,880
twice I'll put it into uh three right

780
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,600
that's why I put them in sub folders

781
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,080
anyways now that I'm ready I'm going to

782
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,399
go render render animation and this is

783
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,919
now kicking it off I can now leave it

784
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,440
walk away and it will just start as it

785
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
finishes uh rendering it'll just start

786
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,480
dumping it into the folder and there you

787
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,440
go so you can see it's uh it's rendered

788
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,279
three frames so we've got three images

789
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,799
here once it's finished we should have

790
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,919
160 Tiff files inside this folder which

791
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,919
you will have to watch the final part of

792
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,440
this tutorial to learn how to take that

793
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
sequence and form a video file that you

794
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,720
can use and send Etc so click here to
