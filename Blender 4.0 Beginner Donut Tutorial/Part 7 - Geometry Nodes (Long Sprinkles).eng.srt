1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
we've got round sprinkles why not long

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,319
sprinkles it'll be more interesting and

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,800
it'll enable us to uh learn some new

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,240
techniques about blender which is what

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,400
this whole series is about so first

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,160
things first we need to uh model those

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,680
sprinkles so let's move to the left here

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,199
and uh we want to add an object we

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,840
haven't mentioned it before but when you

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,720
add an object it's going to put it at

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
your 3D cursor and your 3D cursor is

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
that thing that weird little thing

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,520
little Crosshair at the bottom there

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,160
that's your 3D cursor and uh yeah I

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,480
don't know blunder has a 3D cursor maybe

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,040
other applications don't it's going to

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,520
put it there and if you don't want it

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,000
there you can move that 3D cursor

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,239
somewhere else by hitting shift and

20
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,160
right clicking and you can see it's now

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,719
moved it and actually attached it to the

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,559
plane which is where we would want it if

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
you don't have a mouse do get a mouse

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,440
but in the interim you can also use the

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
the uh cursor tool and that'll do uh the

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,559
same thing all right so we're adding

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
long sprinkles so obviously the object

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
that we want to add is shift a mesh it's

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
the cylinder okay too big by default so

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,119
let's change click this little thing

31
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,159
bring this up change the radius all the

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,159
way to its lowest and the depth all the

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,520
way to its lowest as well and the

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
vertices that's the uh like the

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
resolution right oh we'll fix that in a

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
sec um the resolution it' be way too

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,560
high at 32 to be scattered on an object

38
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,400
so let's set this to 12 and that'll be

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,079
just enough that it won't look Jagged

40
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,119
and it'll look smooth okay great now I'm

41
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,680
going to move this up just so it's above

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,960
the plane Zed okay now this problem that

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
you have if you go in too far it

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
disappears the reason for that is that

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,880
uh blender has a clipping start value

46
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,759
and because we're working at such a

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,880
small small scale we've got sprinkle

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,479
sized things now um it's too small and

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,320
it's clipping it out so if you hit n and

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,320
go to your view tab the clip start value

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,000
there it's 1 cm by default drag it all

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,280
the way to the left and it's now a

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,520
millimeter and it will have fixed that I

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,479
don't know why it's not the default like

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
maybe somebody can tell me why is that

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,160
not the default value maybe there's a

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
reason but to me that would make sense

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,800
cuz then you never have this problem I

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,440
don't know any disadvantages so anyway

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
we've got uh the base of a Sprinkle need

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,200
to make it long so tab into edit mode s

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,840
scale it Zed along the Z axis to

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,440
elongate it and now we've got the rough

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,319
length of a Sprinkle but how long is a

65
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,560
Sprinkle there's no actual answer to

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,760
that if you look at reference they are

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,640
all over the place the government

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
evidently never stepped in and said like

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
we're going to regulate it this is the

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,319
the length of a Sprinkle this is the

71
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,400
size of a spring I mean it's it's it's

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,959
the wild west out there they're doing

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,040
crazy things so uh what that means as

74
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,440
artists is we get to pick whatever is

75
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,319
most visually pleasing and I like the

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
ones which are more readable and to show

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,080
you what I mean if we pull up two right

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,319
this one on the left is like large

79
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,840
sprinkles right very like bold and then

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,799
one on the right here is like long thin

81
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,200
wispy ones that look like theyd get

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,040
stuck in your teeth and if we zoom out

83
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,200
on this and then zoom out on this you

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,159
can see that the ones on the right tend

85
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,120
to kind of like the colors and

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
everything just kind of blur together

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,120
and it just looks like a dut whereas the

88
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
one on the left the sprinkles are still

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,200
readable so that's what we mean by

90
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,920
readable and that's the one I like the

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,760
most so we're going to go with some uh

92
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,080
larger looking long sprinkles but you

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,799
can see that the sizes there's no

94
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,159
standard size because I think it's

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,920
actually like it's from a Piping Bag at

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
least if you make them at home but you

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,480
can just pipe out icing and then when it

98
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
dries you just smash it up and it

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
becomes sprinkles um but yeah they they

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,319
just come out at any odd size so we got

101
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,319
long ones we got medium ones we got

102
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,400
short ones and we've even got some curvy

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,720
looking ones right these little like

104
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,959
like just slightly bsh looking ones so

105
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,079
we're going to model small medium large

106
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,000
and a bsh looking one and then we're

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
going to scatter that across the object

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,879
so back in blender this is going to be

109
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,239
yeah let's this this will be the the

110
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,918
short one uh okay but the end speaking

111
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,478
of which this end bit here uh it's a

112
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,280
very sharp edge and even if we hit uh

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,520
shade smooth it's not going to solve it

114
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,479
we want that like a rounded form to it

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
not this hor Blobby looking shape um

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,039
because the reference again you can see

117
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,000
oh it's another it's a different

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,639
reference now is uh is a rounded shape

119
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,560
all right so to create that rounded form

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,639
we're going to create a bevel and so I

121
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,120
want you to go into face select mode

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
okay which you can do by that so this is

123
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,520
the faces right this is the edges if you

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
go to Edge select mode and then this is

125
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,840
the the face there so select the bottom

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
and the top face like that and then

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,520
we're going to add a bell which will

128
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,000
immediately become clear when you do it

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,479
contrl B and now that we're in this

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,919
state as we pull out we can change the

131
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,479
the amount of the bevel and this is uh

132
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,039
you can see it's it's like yeah it's

133
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,880
just adding a 45° angle on that that

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,160
corner there but if you scroll up it's

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,440
going to add another level to it and if

136
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,840
you scroll up again it's going to add

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
another level to that so we can very

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
quickly create a rounded Edge to the

139
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
sprinkle uh you don't want to go too

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,199
much higher because again this is going

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,000
to be scattered all over the donut you

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,759
don't want to go too high poly so

143
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,319
that'll do so that's a simple bevel

144
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,120
operation and it's very common when

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,639
you're modeling so yeah contrl B is how

146
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,240
you do that all right so look at that

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,080
we've got one sprinkle so now we need to

148
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,720
create three more so this is the small

149
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,199
so let's go shift d and then X to just

150
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
move it along the x-axis this is going

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
to be the medium one so edit mode and

152
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,319
I'm going to go into toggle YF frame and

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
verticy select mode and now selecting

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,160
the top part of the sprinkle hit G Zed

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,520
and I'm going to move oops if you got

156
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,039
proportional editing turn that off g z

157
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,199
move that

158
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,800
up okay that'll be the medium one yep

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,039
and now shift d x move it along this is

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,680
going to be the long one so edit mode

161
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,240
and again g z move it up and this is

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,599
going to be the long sprinkle I don't go

163
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,919
too long maybe that long okay and then I

164
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,720
want to make a bent sprinkle it's

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
slightly like curved so shift d x move

166
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
it across and now with this one if I was

167
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,120
to try to like curve this out there's

168
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,639
not enough information here like if I

169
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,199
move that it's just a straight edge

170
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,319
there so if I want to make it curved I

171
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,759
got to have more geometry there so like

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,840
we've done in the past crlr is how you

173
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,919
create a loop cut so when you do that it

174
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,840
says where do you want to put it I want

175
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,160
more than one though so I'm going to

176
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,039
scroll up till I get yeah just a bunch

177
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
of Loops until I get what looks like squ

178
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,639
square faces on those points somewhere

179
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,879
around that I don't want to go too high

180
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,879
poly yeah like that what is that that's

181
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,199
in the bottom leftand corner eight eight

182
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
Cuts Okay click and then it's say way do

183
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,440
you want to place it right click to

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,800
cancel the movement so it places it

185
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,960
right in the center and

186
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,199
now there we go okay now we've got this

187
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,440
one over here that is just long and

188
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,280
straight but low poly and this one same

189
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,360
shape but High poly so to add a uh Bend

190
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,240
to it in previous tutorials I actually

191
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,039
went into like edit mode and we did like

192
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,199
proportional editing and it was just

193
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,960
complicated and it actually didn't look

194
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,599
great I've learned actually there's a

195
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
modifier that'll do it very simply go to

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,280
your modifier stack add modifier uh you

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,479
could find it inside here uh or you

198
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,840
could search for it but it's the simple

199
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,080
deform uh modifier so add that and by

200
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,720
default it is wrong so change it from

201
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,800
twist to bend and look at that we've got

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,919
our sprinkle ha and you can very easily

203
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,879
whoops change the amount from a little

204
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,800
curve to a large curve and I think

205
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,879
somewhere around the 30° Mark you will

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,159
notice though that it's it's like it's

207
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,680
bent more at this angle and that's

208
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,639
because it's bending it according to the

209
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
origin point so you see these little

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,240
dots you might have wondered what they

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
are in blender that's called your origin

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
point and it's used for a lot of things

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,599
like if you rotate an object you can see

214
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,599
it's rotating from the point of that

215
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,039
origin Point um like physics a bunch of

216
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,720
things use the origin point the best way

217
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,120
to think of it is like the center of

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
mass for the object so generally

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,599
speaking as a rule of thumb you want it

220
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,240
to be in the center of the object and

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
you can do it very quickly you select

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
multiple objects you want to clear its

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,839
uh origin Point shift select all of them

224
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,880
and then right click and then say set

225
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,519
origin origin to geometry and now you

226
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,120
can see it's put it in the middle and

227
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,480
now our curve is actually based on the

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,120
uh starting in the middle which is what

229
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,160
we want so y for us now I need to apply

230
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,279
app this or else the next part it'll go

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,880
wonky so apply your simple to form so

232
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,440
that it's actually uh yeah uh realized

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,640
onto the uh onto the mesh okay so going

234
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,680
to your outline you can see we've well

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,279
we started from humble beginnings but

236
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,720
we've now got too much going on and it's

237
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
it's all starting to get a little bit

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,959
chaotic so the way you organize things

239
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,600
in your outline and in blender generally

240
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,079
uh is uh you can group things together

241
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,560
um by creating collections so by default

242
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,680
we've actually got one collection

243
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,079
already just called collection but we

244
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,240
can create new collections by this

245
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
little button in the top right hand

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
corner to create new collection um and I

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
want to create it outside of our I mean

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,680
I don't actually know if we need like I

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,279
don't know why it creates a collection

250
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,320
for you for no I mean you could just

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,519
it's in the scene collection anyways I

252
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,160
don't know if we actually need that one

253
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,800
um so we create a new collection just by

254
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,920
hitting that and we can double click it

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
to rename it to be whatever it is we

256
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,480
want so I'm going to call this sprinkles

257
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,399
okay um and because we have two types of

258
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,519
sprinkles we have the sphere round

259
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,079
sprinkle and then we have these long

260
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,040
sprinkles I'm going to create two other

261
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
um collections within this collection so

262
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,959
hitting new again you can see it's

263
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,600
placed it underneath it and I'm going to

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
call this one round and then clicking

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,720
sprinkles again I'll add another

266
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,040
collection and this one I will call long

267
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,680
oh wait sorry this one long there we go

268
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,600
okay so to move something to a

269
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
collection you can do it one of two ways

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
one you can select

271
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
the uh the sphere which is the round

272
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,680
remember it's this little guy over here

273
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,800
the little tiny round sprinkle you can

274
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,240
just drag that into the uh that

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
collection and you can see it's now

276
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
moved it there the other way is in your

277
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,040
3D viewport if you select all of the

278
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,880
objects that you want to move to a new

279
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,519
collection hit M and it brings up this

280
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,000
and you just say move to the sprinkles

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
long sub collection there we go and now

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
they're all moved there and now this one

283
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,839
here if you wanted to give this a name

284
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,000
you could um we got the camera we got

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
the light we got the plane yeah you know

286
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,000
what let's move our donut our donut and

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,360
our icing let's move that to a new

288
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,800
collection as well so M and we can

289
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
actually create a new collection from

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
the move uh options as well so I'm going

291
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,560
to go new and let's call this do let's

292
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,200
say Donuts cuz we're going to duplicate

293
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
and make more Donuts in the future so

294
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,040
Donuts okay great so now this one here

295
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,360
has got the camera the light and the

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
plane so I'm going to do what I

297
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,399
sometimes do with a scene is just call

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,399
this one EnV which is for environment

299
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,720
since this is a tutorial I'll actually

300
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
just type it out I'm not going to be

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,600
lazy environment Okay so we've got some

302
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,959
organization in our scene so that as we

303
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,560
add and grow our scene it's not going to

304
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,760
get too uh crazy all right so it's also

305
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,920
good that we've created collections

306
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,440
because we can now use that to scatter

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,600
across the geometry notes so with our uh

308
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,839
donut here so the icing and the donut

309
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,320
we're going to create a duplicate and uh

310
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,720
this is going to be the variant with the

311
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
long sprinkles so shift D and then hit X

312
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,560
to move it along the uh x axis so let's

313
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,800
just place next to it and then clicking

314
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,399
your icing you can see we've got the

315
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,519
modify stack that we've uh we created

316
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,680
the geometry nodes on and if we were to

317
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,360
start tweaking this and make this look

318
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,040
like long sprinkles it would apply to

319
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,160
this one over here because we can see

320
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,920
that little number next to it and that

321
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,600
number if you hover over it I think we

322
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,519
mentioned it before but displays the

323
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,600
number of users sharing this data so any

324
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
change you make to this is going to be

325
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,160
reflected on that one um so if we click

326
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
the two button it's now independent so

327
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,000
we'll now have two different versions so

328
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,519
the one on the left the one the original

329
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,199
one let's call that round sprinkles and

330
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,839
the one on the right let's call that one

331
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,399
long brain fart for a second there long

332
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,040
sprinkles okay and now with that object

333
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,800
selected let's go back to the geometry

334
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,480
nodes tab okay all right so make sure

335
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
you're looking at the right object make

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,199
sure it's the the one with long

337
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,839
sprinkles in the name and if we were to

338
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,959
start editing here we would have one we

339
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,199
we would have made one big mistake and

340
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,800
it would it's because this is actually

341
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,480
not the long sprinkles node setup we

342
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,079
click the pin button remember that the

343
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,839
pin means it's always going to be there

344
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,160
even if it's another object with a

345
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,199
different geometry node setup so

346
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,320
remember yeah it's a common mistake you

347
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,800
always do it you forget you've got pin

348
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
on and you start changing things and it

349
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,399
does the wrong one so make sure you're

350
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,800
looking at the one that has long

351
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,959
sprinkles in the name okay so the bit

352
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,519
the bit that obviously matters the most

353
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
is this this bit where it goes into our

354
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
instance on points node and we've

355
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
currently got it connected to a sphere

356
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,839
so I mean you could change that to

357
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,560
another object but that won't help us

358
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,519
because we've got more than one object

359
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,839
we want to scatter four different

360
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,240
objects across it so we can delete that

361
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,720
and instead just drag from your outliner

362
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
don't just uh if if you click on it um

363
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,240
oh yeah yeah if you click off it it's

364
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,959
just going to disappear so make sure you

365
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,000
don't do it uh you've clicked the icing

366
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,839
but you need to click and drag into your

367
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
node setup and now it's got a collection

368
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,399
info node rather than object info node

369
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,839
drag that into your instance input and

370
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,160
nothing happened it has actually

371
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,639
happened but it's off center in a weird

372
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,959
place why is it doing that it's because

373
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,279
of the way 3D software handles data it's

374
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,399
now doing it on its like Global or local

375
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,600
position not Rel relative to anyway it

376
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,959
doesn't matter all what you need to do

377
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,360
is check three boxes whenever you use

378
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,360
collections to scatter separate reset

379
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,759
children now it's on the mesh correctly

380
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,199
and then it's you can see it's actually

381
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
using all four of them on each point so

382
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,199
then you click pick instance and now

383
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,279
it's going to use one of those not all

384
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,360
four of them together okay so it's good

385
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,199
it's uh it's using it but what's going

386
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,560
on well the reason reason this one was

387
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,519
easier with its round sprinkles is that

388
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,920
the rotation of the objects didn't

389
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
matter because it was round now that we

390
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,240
have long sprinkles you can see the

391
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,160
rotation matters and it's currently

392
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,360
screwed up so how do we fix that the

393
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,040
first way well yeah there's a number of

394
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,199
things you need to do to make it work

395
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,320
correctly you you'll see is uh we want

396
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,519
to take the rotation of the face so the

397
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,759
face of this these mesh here we want it

398
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,000
to affect the objects right so we take

399
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,720
the output of our distribute points on

400
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
faces the rotation of that and drag it

401
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,759
into the rotation input of the instances

402
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
and now you can see it's having some

403
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,519
effect it's still not right but that is

404
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,040
because these

405
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,319
sprinkles are currently just pointed

406
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,639
upwards so it thinks okay well you want

407
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,920
to point them all outwards anyways to

408
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
fix that I mean you could fix it a

409
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,279
number you could actually fix it in

410
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,720
Geometry noes this is simpler so if we

411
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
just rotate those sprinkles along the x

412
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,519
axis so RX right and then we just want

413
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,839
to to lie them down flat so essentially

414
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,639
90° you could type in 90° or holding

415
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,880
down control we'll move it in 5°

416
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,560
increments okay so 90 and then do a

417
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,440
single

418
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,000
click okay so why has that not worked

419
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,560
well it's because as I mentioned before

420
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,759
when you're scaling or rotating things

421
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,079
it's not actually saved to the object so

422
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,120
to apply it you have to go control a and

423
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,279
then say rotation now that we've done

424
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,959
that it's worked correctly all right so

425
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,920
now you can see what I said by uh to do

426
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,440
a lot to make it work correctly um the

427
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,519
rotation is working but it's not doing

428
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,319
what you would expect and that's because

429
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,000
geometry nodes are so flexible you have

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,959
to tell it exactly what you want to do

431
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
we want actually random rotation so

432
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
around each of the points we don't want

433
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,519
to each have the exact same rotation we

434
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,880
need to randomize it so for that if you

435
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,480
want to tweak the rotation on anything

436
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,759
between this point here on this uh

437
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,399
dotted Blue Line let's just move that

438
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
out the way uh we need to add shift a

439
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,720
utility

440
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,119
rotation rotate not Ula Oiler that yes I

441
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,199
know they went with the weird

442
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
pronunciation I think it was a Frenchman

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
right could be German doesn't matter

444
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
same same right just to annoy all the

445
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,039
Europeans um anyways rotate Oiler and

446
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,480
we're just going to drop it on that line

447
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,199
till it lines up okay so nothing's

448
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,240
happened currently but with this we

449
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,160
could change the rotation of our

450
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,679
sprinkles up here but you'll notice that

451
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,320
as you rotate it's kind of weird it's

452
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,240
not the rotation that you would expect

453
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,200
for each point it's the relative to the

454
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,440
actual object as a whole right which

455
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
just means we need to change from object

456
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,559
to local and now as you move it around

457
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,320
you can see we're able to rotate those

458
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
sprinkles but again it's not changing

459
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
the RO like randomizing it it's giving a

460
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,360
solid value so to randomize it if we

461
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,559
drag out of the rotate by input and then

462
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,039
type in random it'll bring up uh this

463
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,280
and we're looking for random value Val

464
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,640
click and now we get this

465
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,360
ooh so this node looks kind of scary

466
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,080
right it's got a whole bunch of

467
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
different values in it and it says

468
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,919
vector and it's very very foreign it's

469
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,480
actually easy to understand it from a

470
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,520
float uh point of view with with the

471
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,280
random value if it's in a float State

472
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,760
it's going to generate a value from zero

473
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,480
to one on each point so if you've got

474
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,640
like 10 points one of them is going to

475
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
be like 015 one is going to be like 092

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,520
and one's you know whatever when it's in

477
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,159
Vector State it's the exact same thing

478
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,039
you've got Min and you've got Max but

479
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,120
there are three values and the reason

480
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
for that is that there are three axes

481
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,960
there's the x axis there's the y axis

482
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,440
and there's the Zed

483
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,760
axis and same here right so you're able

484
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,600
to Define what type of rotation on each

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,520
axis so if we set both uh by the way if

486
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,919
you want to change multiple values at

487
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,960
once in blender um you can just click

488
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,760
and drag down and then you can uh change

489
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,960
all of them so we set all of them to

490
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
zero and uh now you could see this

491
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,240
bottom one is going to be the Zed

492
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,320
because it's XY Z it doesn't tell you

493
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,600
like I don't know because it's Vector

494
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,520
math I guess it's there's other areas of

495
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,919
PL anyway but this this is the Zed axis

496
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,240
if we increase this one you can see

497
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,480
that's the main one that we want to

498
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,400
change right because that's the one that

499
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,000
makes uh the most difference now you

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
might also know looking at this you're

501
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
probably thinking like okay well we need

502
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,600
to rotate it by 360° so we would set

503
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,039
this to 300 60 but you can see they're

504
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,039
more than rotating fully already so what

505
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,480
value is this exactly this is radians oh

506
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,600
just to get real so radians degrees

507
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,320
actually like I had to ask chat gbt

508
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,840
before I recorded this what's the

509
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,080
difference radians are more mathematical

510
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,360
and easier for mathematical equations uh

511
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,799
it's uh it's the

512
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,880
circumference of Pi No 2 pi is the

513
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,240
circumference look obviously I don't

514
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,080
know um but what I'm trying to tell you

515
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,880
is it's you just need double pi to to

516
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,799
make it 360° which is

517
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
actually to to make it really

518
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,600
complicated it's to so double Pi so Pi

519
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,480
is uh

520
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,440
3142 to is double that and uh anyways

521
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,080
you get the idea so you can type in to

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
and it'll actually give you the correct

523
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,200
value so that's 360° rotation um we also

524
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,559
want it cuz you can see this is the

525
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,520
other axes like the the middle one

526
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,480
spinning around so we also want it on

527
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
that one cuz we've got a curved one so

528
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
let's make that towel and then this top

529
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,480
one is the X which is actually going to

530
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,520
make it like wonky like so these will be

531
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,360
like seesing up so if you increase that

532
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,039
that's where it gets crazy and you don't

533
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,559
really want to use that um you do want a

534
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,360
little bit though because it it would

535
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,840
make sense if they're sprinkles they're

536
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,960
not going to be completely flat you're

537
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,320
going to have some variance where like

538
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,679
some bit has absorbed into the icing at

539
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,600
a different angle than another but just

540
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,280
not too much essentially or else it

541
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,360
starts to look like uh like little

542
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,640
marshmallows or whatever all over it um

543
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,799
but guys that's roughly it that's the

544
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,799
hard work that was I mean I know that

545
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,240
was very technical but it was really it

546
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,720
was just two notes rotate Oiler set it

547
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,880
to local and then this random value and

548
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,159
we're changing that to rotate and we did

549
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,200
it we got nice looking rotation now one

550
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
thing we do have to change is

551
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,600
the distance Min so because these longer

552
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,919
sprinkles obviously are bigger then the

553
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
distance Min has to change as well so we

554
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,159
can change that to something that makes

555
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,720
sense let's go

556
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,559
04 H that might have actually been

557
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,120
pretty perfect let's try

558
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,880
three three's got a little bit oh

559
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,480
actually you know what the other thing I

560
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,440
again looking at reference I like those

561
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
big chunky looking sprinkles so I want

562
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,159
these to be bigger so we could you know

563
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,279
alter the scale of the actual sprinkles

564
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,520
but we're working with geometry nodes

565
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
and we've actually got a scale value

566
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,520
right here so we could change it here

567
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,720
just as easily so the scale dragging

568
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,600
down and again there's not just one

569
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
value there's three axis so XY Z so drag

570
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
down on all

571
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,480
1.5 is going to give us some nice big

572
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
chunky looking sprinkles and now this

573
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,760
distance value needs to be a lot bigger

574
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,559
so let's go

575
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,400
06 that's actually pretty good I I'm

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,880
getting pretty good at nailing it no no

577
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,679
no I was right before there's always

578
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,240
going to be some overlap right you're

579
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
not going to be able to stop it cuz it's

580
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
it's not look doing object like

581
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,080
collisions it's nothing like that it's a

582
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,480
very simple again it's doing a point and

583
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
then it's creating a radius around it

584
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,000
and if you do the correct amount which

585
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
for this is probably something like this

586
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,360
then it looks way too predictable and

587
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,840
boring which we don't want so uh 0.6

588
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,720
looks pretty good for me with a scale of

589
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,600
1.5 for these and that is it um I was

590
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,120
going to put in the uh random color in

591
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,559
this part of the tutorial but I think

592
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,480
we've gone over already so join me in

593
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,559
the next part and we will finally add

594
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,960
some color to our sprinkles and make

595
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,039
this look nice so join me in the next

596
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
part
