1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,399
well you made it the end of the series

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,520
you've watched 14 videos so uh before I

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,400
show you how to turn the image sequence

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,639
into a final video I do want to say

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
congratulations because um everyone says

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,320
they want to learn new skills and very

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,920
few people actually want to put in the

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,160
time so if you're watching this you have

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,039
clearly put in the time so I mean that

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,199
truly well done now if you are able to

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,000
go from this series and then go off and

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,439
create and get what you want out of

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
blender then fantastic uh but what I've

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,079
learned over the years is that there is

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,559
a percentage of people who want more

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
they want to know what tutorials to

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
watch next to level up their career so I

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,840
am in the process of creating a blender

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,280
course for beginners M special so this

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
is going to be for you guys essentially

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,559
people who finished this course and then

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,920
they want more they want to know uh how

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,520
do they do other parts of blender Beyond

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
just a donut so it's not available yet

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,840
but I'm looking to release it in early

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,760
2024 if I can um so if you want to be

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
notified when it is available uh click

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
the link in the description and you can

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,759
join a separate email list just for this

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,759
course to be notified once it uh is

31
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,960
available it's not going to be free it

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,040
is going to be a paid course um but it

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,600
is uh yeah for people who really want to

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,159
take this seriously and make a career

35
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,040
out of it that is for you so with that

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,600
out of the way now on to the tutorial if

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,439
you followed the last part correctly you

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,360
should find inside this

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,119
folder 160 Tiff files which are you know

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,680
you can open them individually and look

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,240
at the images but if you want to create

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,920
a video then this is what you do if

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,560
you're using this as part of another

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,000
video project um then you might be using

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
software like Premier I know that's not

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,960
all of you but I'll just quickly show

47
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,399
you for those who want to use Premiere

48
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,240
instead you just click on the first

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,000
image and then check image sequence uh

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,759
that'll import it and then just drag

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,719
that into a new sequence and there you

52
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,840
go and then you can just import uh sorry

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
export that as you would anything in

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
Premiere or edit it Etc but if you want

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,000
to use blender if you want to go the

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,199
free route there is actually a video

57
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,319
editor inside of blender now you can

58
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,200
access it from uh inside here um but I

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
actually find it easier and better to

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,720
just create a new blender instance so

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,239
for that I go file new and then you can

62
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,000
go General but actually if you go video

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,879
editing um then that will just set it up

64
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,680
for you ready to go and it'll just it

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
saves a bunch of time this isn't like a

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,080
special version of blender or anything

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,879
when you choose this like if you want to

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,840
use you know the standard blender layout

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
or whatever it's still there it's just

70
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,480
it's created this video like this screen

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,959
layout and everything is already

72
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,879
configured and ready to go for you

73
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,640
anyways so down here this is your video

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,680
editor this is the sequenc as it's

75
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
called and then up here is going to show

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you the video that it's uh displaying so

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
the first thing we need to do is load in

78
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,519
that image sequence so shift a hotkey

79
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,040
works all over blender choose image

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
sequence navigate to that folder where

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
you have uh all of these Tiff files and

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,560
unlike Premier where you select the

83
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,120
first one and then import that this one

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,920
you need to select all of them so the

85
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,360
hotkey is just a to select everything

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,560
hot Keys work everywhere across blender

87
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,680
and then go add image strip aha now you

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
can see we've got this strip at the

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
bottom here and if we hit the space bar

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
we should see at the top the uh image

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
sequence playing awesome now it looks a

92
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,840
little slow and you'll see actually in

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,439
the top left hand cornner it's playing

94
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,400
at 24 frames a second and that's because

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
although we set it up as 30 frames a

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,000
second we just rendered that into the uh

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,720
image sequence doesn't know what the

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
frame rate is the only reason we did

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,480
that was so that when you're playing the

100
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
animation in the viewport it's actually

101
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,239
at the correct speed but to set it up

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,519
here uh you set your frame rate here

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,680
from uh 24 to 30 and now if you play it

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,159
you'll see it's going at 30 frames a

105
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,640
second it's a little faster it's a

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
little smoother and uh it looks good

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
great now you can see it just kind of

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
kind of ends right just goes into like

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,040
blank nothing and we don't want that I

110
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,200
want to really hold on this end frame

111
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,159
because this is the important frame

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,720
where all the donuts are revealed at the

113
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,439
end there and it's really easy to extend

114
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,159
the last frame you just click on the end

115
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,959
of that strip at the bottom there till

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
it lights up white and then you can

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,759
either click and drag out or hit the

118
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,600
hotkey g um to grab and we can just move

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,320
it all the way to the end so 250 that's

120
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,199
what the uh the final like the frame

121
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,840
range here is right if you want it to be

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
longer or shorter you can change it

123
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,039
there but I'm going to keep it at 250 so

124
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,000
that means now it gets to the end and

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,199
then it just holds here and let you soak

126
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,639
it in soak in those uh those donuts um

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,400
cool and this is fine you could export

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,759
this but I also just want to have a nice

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
fade out at the end because why not just

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,880
learn about something in the video

131
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,199
sequence editor um to do that I'm going

132
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,400
to go shift a and then add in a color

133
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
and and the color is already set up as

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
black so that's fine so I'm just

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
dragging it over the end here and you

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,600
can see it just jumps to the color CU

137
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,039
that's now over the top of that other

138
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,360
strip so it's it's reading top to bottom

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,080
so it's black is over the top and uh

140
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,160
instead of it being a jump cut to black

141
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,080
we obviously want to fade it so to do

142
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,160
that just click that that uh strip there

143
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,039
and then say shift a and then say fade

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,960
fade in and you'll see it's uh it's hard

145
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,800
to read here from this cuz it's got like

146
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,960
black at the bottom but there is a

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
actually can I do

148
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,000
that uh I'm using the same uh hotkey

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
control middle Mouse Button as when

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
we're using the graph editor but you can

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
see there is like a slight uh like a

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,880
little ramp up like that it's just

153
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,440
showing you it's fading in um but there

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,360
you go that's the fade in uh effect

155
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,520
there and what that is doing is it's

156
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,280
just created um a key frame animation

157
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,720
for this opacity slider to just do a

158
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,120
very quick uh fade in there um but there

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
you go so now that's it that's what we

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
want this is what we want to form into a

161
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
video file which we could upload to

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Youtube or Instagram or whatever so to

163
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,479
create that here in your output settings

164
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,720
you want to again choose a folder that

165
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000
you want to save it to I usually save it

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,960
inside of the folder with the frames and

167
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,319
I just call it video and then say accept

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
now because we uh set this up as a new

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,160
video editing file it's automatically

170
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,960
set the file format for us as

171
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,800
ffmpeg video and this is actually the

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,319
most flexible I've never needed Avi jpeg

173
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,919
or raw it just creates those ginormous

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,120
gigabyte files that you can never do

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,560
anything with anyway so ffmpeg is the

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
one you want because it's got the most

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,319
options um and go underneath encoding

178
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,960
and this is where you'll find all of

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,160
your video settings um for encoding so

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
the container that is your like think of

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
it as the file extension right so if

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,720
it's a mob file that would be QuickTime

183
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
if it is a MKV file that annoying format

184
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,240
that premere can't read and it's

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,840
supposed to be better than MP4s but

186
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,680
nothing can read it except VLC anyways

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,560
that would be Metro metosa metosa is the

188
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,520
the one webm that's like a format that

189
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,759
is becoming more common online you could

190
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,280
use that anyways we're going to use MP4

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
so that's MPEG 4 uh because that's the

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,840
most common one that most people need

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,319
video codak we're going to leave it at

194
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,280
the default F sorry h264 is

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,800
fine now uh you're if you're used to

196
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,960
like all these settings of bit rates and

197
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,680
all that you can go into that just by

198
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,199
setting like constant bit rate and you

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,159
can change all this but I usually just

200
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,159
choose one of the uh think of these as

201
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,759
like presets right so high quality is

202
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,639
probably good enough for most people if

203
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,400
you want to go even higher quality

204
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,879
perceptually lossless will mean it's

205
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,319
almost the highest quality possible

206
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,680
possible so there's no loss uh lossless

207
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,240
would put it at no loss at all so it's

208
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,479
like the highest quality I don't think

209
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,919
you ever need that like perceptually

210
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,960
lossless is probably fine for like more

211
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,599
than every case you would need right so

212
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,280
perceptually lossless and that's it um

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
oh audio we don't have any audio if you

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
wanted to you could add in sound here if

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,919
you wanted to we don't have audio so I'm

216
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,319
going to set the audio codc to no audio

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't think it makes a differ to the

218
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,000
output but anyway and uh that's it so

219
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,080
now what do you do to export this the

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,719
same as before it's render animation and

221
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,640
what this does is it just chews through

222
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,799
those frames in the sequence and you can

223
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,159
see at the bottom there how fast it's

224
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,440
going and it's going to fade out Boop

225
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,279
and that's it so the reason it did that

226
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,240
by the way is like cuz like how would it

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,360
know like not to render from the camera

228
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
cuz we just said render animation it's

229
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,320
because in your oh where is it way at

230
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,959
the bottom there on my face we've got

231
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,600
postprocessing and it's set to sequencer

232
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,079
right and if it detects anything in your

233
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,720
sequencer if it detects anything in this

234
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,760
strip here it will then render this

235
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,880
instead of what is in the camera so

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
that's how it knows to use those frames

237
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,200
instead of random anyways all to say

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,040
look we have Al

239
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,200
video playing nicely holds oh soak it up

240
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,320
look at them Donuts Fade Out T so well

241
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,680
done you did it congratulations you made

242
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,560
it to the end of the series if you want

243
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,440
a challenge ooh why not create some dut

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,200
variations you could change the color of

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
the icing and then model some

246
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,920
star-shaped sprinkles and then you've

247
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
got a patriotic dut scene M you could

248
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
use the polygon add-on to import some of

249
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
our free candles and then some Moonlight

250
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,079
for for a moody candl light dut scene

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
you could experiment with some different

252
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
marble textures there's a lot there you

253
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,560
could make the sprinkles gold you could

254
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,320
add in some whiskey glasses a serving

255
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,720
board for a high class expensive dut

256
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
looking scene you could decorate it with

257
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,200
fruit and palm tree models for a

258
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,640
tropical themed dut scene or you could

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
add in some pumpkins change the colors

260
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,440
around and you've got a full themed dut

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,360
scene there's a lot that you could do so

262
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,760
have a stack have a go at it and try to

263
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,800
elevate this and make the dut scene your

264
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
own cuz that's where the real learning

265
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,880
comes in otherwise thank you so much for

266
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,520
watching and I will see you in a future
