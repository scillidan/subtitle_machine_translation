1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,440
it's time to learn about animation or

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,200
more specifically key frame animation

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,279
because character animation with its

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,760
Rigs and bones and things is its own

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,519
entire separate Beast we're not going to

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
get into we're just going to do a very

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,039
simple camera move specifically we want

8
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,279
the camera to start above the donuts and

9
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,880
then fall down to reveal the final plate

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,880
uh at the end right it's an excuse to

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,119
learn about key framing well the basics

12
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,920
of Animation is really simple if you go

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,519
to the bottom of your screen if you're

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,480
in layout

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,840
uh layout at the layout layout at the

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,480
top uh we can drag up on this divider

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,879
here and you can see we've got a

18
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,680
timeline which if I click and drag

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,320
across is currently doing nothing

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
because there is no animation so if we

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,120
pull out right I'm just going to do a

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,559
really simple animation to show you you

23
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,039
don't have to follow this because this

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,320
is a different animation what we're

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
going to do it animation is really

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,800
simple you select the object that you

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,960
want to apply a key frame to and then

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,719
you hit I I for insert key frame frame

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,960
and you get this like scary looking menu

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,360
apparently they're going to change this

31
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,400
eventually but for now you would place a

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
key frame on what it is you're planning

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,960
to animate so in this case it's the

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,479
location right so I want to move the

35
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,040
camera location then I change my frame

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,240
count to be the frame I want it to end

37
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,079
at then I move the object how I want it

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,240
to move right there and then I add

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
another key frame I and then say

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,439
location and now as I play it back which

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
I can do by hitting space bar you can

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,280
see that the camera is moving haha look

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,399
at us right a very simple camera move

44
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,600
now I don't actually want that though so

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
I'm going to delete those key frames um

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
and what we want is we want what I

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,399
showed you at the start we want our

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,360
camera to start uh up here right rotated

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
pointing down this way and then we want

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,040
it to move in an arc uh in this

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,280
direction terrible Arrow um pointed this

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,159
way right now you could do this you

53
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,520
could move the camera up there you could

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
then rotate it to point it down and then

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,039
do a key frame for the location rotation

56
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,479
and then do another one over here but it

57
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,840
would be very difficult to control that

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
movement and really this is a rather

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
simple movement if we have a pivot

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
object if we have something here and

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,640
then we parent that camera to that

62
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,959
object and then we just rotate that

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,959
object it's a lot easier so what we need

64
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,680
to add is uh first of all I want to

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,319
think what do I want to be the center of

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
it what do I want to be where do I want

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,519
that pivot object so I think you know

68
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,160
somewhere roughly in the middle of these

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
Donuts so right here I'm going to hold

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,599
down shift and then right click and

71
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,200
that's going to put my 3D cursor um

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
right where I've put it and now to add

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,239
an object shift a and I'm looking for

74
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,080
empty so an empty I mean if you're

75
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,760
familiar with other creative tools you

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
probably already know but it's just

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,080
something it's uh similar to a null

78
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,120
object in After Effects Etc it's just

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
something that's going to be in the 3D

80
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
view Port that won't be rendered okay a

81
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,840
number of options here it doesn't matter

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
which one you choose you can go plain

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
axes uh and then if you went to the

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,040
options here the data you could change

85
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,400
the display here to what we saw um

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
before but this is just like a different

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,760
display um object right depending on

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,400
what you're looking for I think the

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,560
sphere is actually the most useful it's

90
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,159
way too big currently so I'm going to

91
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,200
change the size to be something about

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,159
that and there we go okay so now what we

93
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,040
need to do is we want to parent our

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,360
camera to this new empty object so

95
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,200
select the camera first then shift

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,080
select that new empty that we've just

97
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,480
created and then I'm going to hit contrl

98
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
p and then set parent object keep

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,760
transform just like what we did um with

100
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,959
the icing and the donut so now you

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,480
should see if you select that empty and

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,439
as I rotate it around the camera will

103
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,319
rotate with it and if you look through

104
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,239
the camera with numpad zero and then

105
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,000
just double tap r you can see that I can

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,560
track ball rotate around it um and you

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,879
can see this is like way more flexible

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
for what we want we want the camera to

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,120
be focused on one point and then we just

110
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,519
want to move the camera around that

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,040
point um and you can do some really nice

112
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,599
fast camera moves here if you wanted to

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,640
do something snazzy in our case we're

114
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,319
going to do a nice simple slow movement

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
so first of all this angle this look

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,680
that we've got right here is where we

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,399
want the final reveal to be so this is

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
where I want the end point the End Key

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,400
frame of my animation to be so you can

120
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,160
make your animation as long as you want

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,240
I think about 160 frames is about right

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
for this sort of uh the the the speed of

123
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,479
this animation so on frame 160 there you

124
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,360
can see it's also mentioned there I'm

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
going to with my empty selected not my

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,840
camera I'm going to hit I and then not

127
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,800
select location like I did before but

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
rotation because we're going to be just

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,600
rotating that Pivot Point not changing

130
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,039
its um its position so rotation then I'm

131
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,919
going to go to the first frame which I

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
could do by clicking and dragging or

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,520
shift left Arrow will jump you to the

134
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
first uh frame or you can click these

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,280
little um I don't know you call that

136
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,120
button jump to end point um you can do

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
that as well and now that I'm here I'm

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
going to rotate this along not the Tilt

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,840
axis which it is by default but the x

140
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,479
axis aha right so now you can see we're

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,360
doing that exact move we want and in the

142
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,919
top left hand corner you can see the

143
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,120
exact number of degrees um and I'm going

144
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,479
to go with exactly minus 90 so if you

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,440
hold down control you can see it's

146
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,240
snapping to uh minus 90 and then I'm

147
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,520
going to click okay now before I change

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
my my frame if I was to change the frame

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,919
um you can see it's just snapped me back

150
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,280
to where I were so always remember you

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,759
have to create a key frame if you've

152
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,639
changed its movement without saving it

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,000
or without putting in a new key frame so

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,039
back up to here minus 90 and I'm going

155
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,680
to hit I and then say rotation okay and

156
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
now we should see if we hit space bar to

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,440
play a very very simple

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,479
animation okay now we can tweak this

159
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,160
though we can improve this because you

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,039
can see that for one it's a little

161
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,240
awkward that the camera starts in a

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,520
completely stationary stop position then

163
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,240
it ramps up and then it slows down

164
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,160
towards the end it's a little bit of a

165
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,479
weird camera move what I want instead is

166
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,479
I want it to start I already want it to

167
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,759
be moving right like almost like it's

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,240
from another shot that's kind of faded

169
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,680
into this one I want it to start moving

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
and then to much more slowly fade it out

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,919
than it is currently CU you can see it

172
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,199
just kind of like drops down here and

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,000
then the camera just stops and it's a

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,080
little too sudden and while you could

175
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,039
change the key frames here like you can

176
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,919
do some very simple uh handle type

177
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
changes this view this layout view is

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
not the best place to do this so instead

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,759
if you go to the animation tab at the

180
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,680
top there you can see it's again it's

181
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,080
rearranged all your screens um this over

182
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,319
here is just another 3D view over here

183
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,199
is the camera uh the camera view but at

184
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,479
the bottom here you can see we've

185
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,360
changed from the timeline which is what

186
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
we had before and it's changed to a dope

187
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,360
sheet so a dope sheet is just going to

188
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,199
show you more information

189
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,160
um about the key frames so for example

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
you can see that the X rotation has a

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
DOT over here and a DOT over here but

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,759
the Y and the Zed um has a different

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,800
look it's got a continuous line across

194
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
it and that's to show you that this

195
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,360
actually hasn't changed that the Y and

196
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
the Zed has no information that's uh

197
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,560
changed from the start to the end so we

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,080
don't actually need these key frames so

199
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,160
I only need the X rotation so I'm going

200
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,400
to select the Y and the Zed and I'm just

201
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,720
going to delete them just by hitting the

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,360
delete key so we've now just got one

203
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,680
channel that the animation is happening

204
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
on right but we can't really change it

205
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
we can't make it so this starts faster

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,720
and then this slows down from this view

207
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,639
instead we need to change to a different

208
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,319
view so in the top leftand Corner click

209
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
this and we're going to change the

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,080
window type to be graph editor okay so

211
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
the graph editor looks like this I'm

212
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
going to use middle Mouse to uh pan

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
around here and you can see we've now

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,400
got a line right with some handles on it

215
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,599
which is a lot easier to understand but

216
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,319
it's hard to get it all in the view so

217
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,560
you could hit the home key and that will

218
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,319
automatically reorient everything um to

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,759
position it in the view or if you hold

220
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,240
down control and middle Mouse button

221
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,360
this enables you to just moving around

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,240
just dragging around control middle

223
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,400
Mouse button will change the uh the axis

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,800
Zoom as well as the Y right up and down

225
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
like that um which is just a really

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
handy way to quickly Orient yourself

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
around so control middle Mouse to change

228
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,879
this and then you can uh middle Mouse to

229
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,839
pan to a different area Okay so again

230
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,719
making sure I'm looking at the X

231
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,479
rotation there right and if we look you

232
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,440
should see the problem that we have

233
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,679
right we have the start of the animation

234
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
it's a very slow curve that's going up

235
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
it picks up speed in the middle uh and

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
then it ends here and the end is a

237
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,360
little abrupt considering uh the amount

238
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,399
of movement that it has so really we

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,120
want um this line instead to look a

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
little bit closer to this line right or

241
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
even I mean that was kind of a bad line

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,920
pull it rather like that okay that's the

243
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,959
kind of look that we want so with our

244
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,480
starting key frame here I'm going to use

245
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,399
the same hotkey that you use everywhere

246
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,480
uh and that's R um to just get that

247
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,680
angle to look a lot closer to what I

248
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,040
want don't go too far up if you go like

249
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,079
vertical you'll see that the start is

250
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,600
like so abrupt it's almost like it's

251
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,720
like skipping down or something so I

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
don't want it to be that far I'm going

253
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,480
to rotate a little bit out like that so

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,519
there's a little bit of a harsh movement

255
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,560
but not too harsh if you know what I

256
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,320
mean there we go something like that and

257
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,880
then for this end bit you can see it

258
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,959
ends rather suddenly maybe you disagree

259
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,200
but I found when I looked at the

260
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,839
animation it was rather sudden so this

261
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,040
final end point here I'm going to scale

262
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,560
It Out by hitting s so again same

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
hotkeys work all across blender which is

264
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
very nice awesome so now if I play it

265
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,360
back you should see it moves rather fast

266
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,120
at the beginning and then slowly tapers

267
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
out out towards the end to a nice soft

268
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Landing which is really cool and that's

269
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,440
pretty well yeah that's a pretty good

270
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,040
animation now we could stop here but the

271
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
other thing we could do to get a little

272
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,279
bit more Motion in it is we could have

273
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,360
the camera start closer to the donuts

274
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,399
and then pull out as it goes further

275
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,839
away I hate that this keeps uh

276
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,880
interrupting I'm going to hide that okay

277
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
there we go select my Pivot there we go

278
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
so uh essentially we could have it so

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,959
that it starts like the camera starts

280
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,360
right about here and then it pulls out

281
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,040
and then as it pulls out it goes a

282
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,079
little bit further away and like ends

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,200
back here so have a think about how you

284
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,120
would do that how would you have the

285
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,120
camera start closer to the pivot point

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,800
right now you might think well okay we

287
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
could animate the camera pulling in

288
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,839
closer but that would be overly

289
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,959
complicated we can just use the same

290
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,160
pivot point but we can scale it because

291
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,760
you can see if I hit s look at that the

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,040
camera goes closer and if I pull it out

293
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,560
you can see the camera moves f further

294
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,079
away so what I want to do is I want to

295
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,040
go to the uh the final Endo here the

296
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,399
frame 160 which by the way you can jump

297
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,720
to an existing key frame just by using

298
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,320
the up and down arrows so if I go up you

299
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,760
can see it's uh that key frame or down

300
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,480
it uh takes me to the front so I want to

301
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,720
go here and I want to create uh a key

302
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,600
frame just for the scale information so

303
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,519
here cuz this is the end view that I

304
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,560
want so I'm going to hit I and then say

305
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,680
not rotation but scale so now I'm going

306
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,000
to go to the front of the animation and

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,959
I'm going to scale it in to get a nice

308
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
closeup of the donuts right there and

309
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,079
then I'm going to add another key frame

310
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,040
I and then scale so you should now see

311
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,639
in your graph editor that's what it's

312
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,320
called um you should see your rotation

313
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
information and then your scale

314
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
information now you'll know that the

315
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,279
scale is like like where is the scale

316
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,920
information it's here but it's so small

317
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,079
like the amount of uh variant here it's

318
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,560
so small that it it's just not readable

319
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,839
and the reason for that is that it's

320
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,079
trying to combine two different data

321
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,440
types into one view right because

322
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,079
rotation is happening on a you can see

323
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,000
here it's a oh I just wrote over the top

324
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
of it it's 0 degre and then down here

325
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,680
you've got minus 90 so this is a minus

326
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,519
90 right but then up here we've got

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
scale that's happening between a zero

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,320
range and a one range which is right

329
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,399
next to it okay so one you could just

330
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
hide your rotation or you can click on

331
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,720
normalize and normalize will uh put

332
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,560
everything between a zero to one range

333
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
but just know that when you're in this

334
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
range if you try to move a key frame to

335
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
be a different value like you took your

336
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
scale and then you moved it down when

337
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,160
you confirm it it'll snap back to where

338
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,839
it was and that's because with normalize

339
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,440
on it'll always put everything between 0

340
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,800
to 1 so don't do it if you're planning

341
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,720
to change a value of something normalize

342
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
um but other otherwise it's uh it's okay

343
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,199
to use for changing the handles like in

344
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,440
this case but I'm going to hide my

345
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,160
rotation anyway cuz it's just going to

346
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,279
get in the way um and instead you can

347
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,440
see that x y and Zed all have

348
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,680
information in them because of course

349
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,320
we're not scaling it on any particular

350
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,560
axis it's across all three axes at once

351
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,760
because it's like a yeah it's the

352
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
uniform value of

353
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
scale so um again I could do the same

354
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,839
thing here I could rotate this I don't

355
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,199
want there to be too much of a

356
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,120
difference like it's actually pretty

357
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,000
good by default like the scale isn't as

358
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,480
noticeable that it slowly ramps up um

359
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
and it's good to have like a kind of a

360
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,320
softer movement as it pulls away but I

361
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,680
do want to change it a little bit I'm

362
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
going to select these final end points

363
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,760
I'll scale that out a little bit as well

364
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,040
just so it's a little softer as it

365
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,760
scales

366
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,240
out and that is pretty good

367
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,920
folks now you'll note as I play through

368
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,680
this that in the top leftand corner of

369
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,199
the screen you've got FPS which stands

370
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,440
for frames per second if you play video

371
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
games you're already well familiar with

372
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
that term uh and you can see as we play

373
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,399
through it it can't really make up its

374
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
mind it's like 24 no 25 26 24 it's I

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,240
think it's just a readout glitch in in

376
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,639
blunder it's actually a constant 24

377
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
frames per second by default but for

378
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
whatever reason it's kind of like

379
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,000
fluctuating between them anyway point is

380
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,360
is you can change that amount by going

381
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,880
to your output settings over here and

382
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
then underneath format you've got frame

383
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,759
rate now for whatever reason blunder

384
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,320
chose 24 frames per second which is

385
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,959
really only used for feature film

386
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,440
everyone else for like TV or YouTube

387
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,399
it's 30 frames per second you can also

388
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,759
uh go 60 frames per second if you wanted

389
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,320
to really pay for longer render times

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
because it means things uh have to be

391
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,160
you have to render like twice as many

392
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
frames but it means things are buttery

393
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,160
smooth you won't actually see it right

394
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,199
now because I'm recording this tutorial

395
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,279
at 30 frames per second anyways really

396
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,759
the the options that most people choose

397
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,759
are 24 for Cinema and feature films 30

398
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,279
if you're a normal person and you're

399
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
making things for internet or YouTube or

400
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,560
anything and then 60 if it's for like 3D

401
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
content or something that has to be

402
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
really really smooth anyways we're going

403
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,959
to set it to 30 cuz that is the more

404
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,839
standard frame rate for uh for most

405
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,800
things I know people like to argue but

406
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,680
yes 30 is in my opinion a much more

407
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,079
reasonable uh frame rate for most things

408
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,320
and the final thing you'll note um as we

409
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,800
play through this is that it gets to

410
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
frame 160 and then it just kind of

411
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,000
pauses for a bit until it gets to frame

412
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,759
250 and then it Loops back and that is

413
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
because uh the end frame is set to 250

414
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
so if we set this to 160 instead which

415
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
is what our animation ends at you can

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,720
see it will now play through and it'll

417
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,319
get to the end and then it will loop

418
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,800
back to the start and also if you want

419
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,759
to like reset this this uh this view in

420
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,560
your timeline you can hit the home key

421
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
and that'll like expand it out a little

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
bit um and there you go so that is

423
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
basically our final animation you can

424
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,079
tweak it you can make it look a little

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,440
bit more polished than what I have here

426
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,839
cuz when I'm recording a tutorial I can

427
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,759
only do so much before people get bored

428
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,399
um but that's that's pretty good it's

429
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,720
not bad so we are nearing the end go

430
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,560
ahead click here to join me in what

431
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
might be the final part uh we're going

432
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,560
to do rendering and forming that uh that

433
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,680
final animation so click there and I

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
will see you there
