1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,520
the time has finally come to decorate

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,600
our delicious looking donut with some

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
sprinkles so the feature we need for

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
that is called geometry nodes and you

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,400
can access it by going to the top of

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,200
your screen if you don't see it just

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
middle Mouse drag across and you'll see

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,080
the tab geometry nodes ohoo so it's

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,519
adjusted your screen layout don't get

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,080
disorientated your Don note is still

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,279
there this screen on the left here it's

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,400
called the spreadsheet never needed it

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,920
touch on would never will um so we can

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,560
just close that right click join areas

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,920
and then just collapse it into it okay

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,440
so with your icing selected click the

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,960
new button so welcome to the world of

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,320
geometry nodes so geometry nodes is

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,399
actually a modifier so when we hit new

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,480
there we've added in a modifier called

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
geometry nodes and what the modifier is

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,600
doing is whatever we want it to okay so

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,199
what this this section down here is this

24
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,160
is a node based system and it looks

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,719
familiar right you got boxes with little

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,399
Lin lines and it's the exact same type

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
of system that was used in our materials

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
right but it's a completely different

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,080
system okay so the same nodes will not

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,759
be referenced um between the completely

31
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,400
different systems so the way this works

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,680
is our mesh that we've got here of our

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,080
icing is what is being represented on

34
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,040
the left hand side with your input it's

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
then taking that mesh and it's feeding

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,079
it all the way to the right and it's

37
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,360
going to spit out whatever is in your

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,960
group output So currently nothing has

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,439
changed because there's nothing between

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,520
those points

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,880
but if I was for example don't follow me

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,680
but just as an example if I was to add a

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,280
set position node drop this in here and

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,759
then change the position of the icing

45
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,759
along the Zed axis you can see it's

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,600
raised it okay now the mesh if I go into

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,799
edit mode is still there the mesh has

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,439
not changed so we're not actually moving

49
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,759
the object this is just happening after

50
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,680
the fact via a modifier okay now

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
obviously this would be a rather

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
pointless use for geometry nodes to move

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
move it cuz you could just move it um

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
but as an example let's say I don't know

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,439
you had a scene where lots of objects

56
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,479
some of them are raised some of them are

57
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,840
not and you wanted to quickly change

58
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
them what you could do with geometry

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,920
nodes in this case you could actually

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,879
expose this offset value by dragging it

61
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,959
to the left over here and when you do

62
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,160
that you can see it's now appeared over

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
here in our modifier stack what that

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,560
means is whenever I'm in another part of

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,720
B of blender say I'm like building stuff

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
and I'm like oh yeah I need to quickly

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,920
you know change the the height of that

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,239
icing I've got it there whenever I need

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,959
to so essentially this system enables

70
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,519
you to build your own tool that does

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,800
something that you want it to do in a

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
really flexible way so it's really

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,040
powerful um and before geometry nodes I

74
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,519
mean blender was kind of limited in what

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,680
you can do but I'll throw some examples

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
here but in the last 2 years since it's

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,480
uh been in blender people have done some

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,200
wild stuff with it um and most of this

79
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
stuff really was just not part possible

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
in blender before without doing custom

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
scripting so it's really opened up the

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
doors so it is a very different system

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,799
like it's a different way of working um

84
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,040
than you know just Hands-On in 3D but

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,720
it's a really flexible really valuable

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
um system so any time spent learning

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
geometry nodes I think is time well

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,280
spent so we want to do sprinkles and to

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,599
do that we need to first of all scatter

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,599
some points onto our mesh so to do that

91
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,239
hit shift a a for ADD and then we're

92
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,519
looking for Point distribute points on

93
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,599
faces okay and then it's just put uh

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,120
sorry it's going to put you in a

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,319
placement State and if you just Mouse

96
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,840
over that line there till it lights up

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,400
if you click it's going to automatically

98
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,040
connect it for you and now you can see

99
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,200
we've got points on our icing and our

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
density value great but you might notice

101
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
the icing has actually disappeared ooh

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
now the reason for that is we've told it

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,200
okay give us take that icing object and

104
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,079
convert it into points and then just

105
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,400
give us the points back okay so what we

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
need to do is say yes we want the points

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,159
but we also want the original mesh so we

108
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,280
can do that by adding in a node that you

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
use all the time which is shift a

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,238
geometry join geometry so you'll find

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,320
this node in probably any geometry noes

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
tutorial very versatile so drop it in

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,880
here after the points and you'll notice

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,520
this input here is a different shape so

115
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,560
normally inputs are circles or you know

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
triangles or whatnot this one is a long

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
an elongated shape to signify that it

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,039
can accept multiple inputs so one likee

119
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,840
these where you can only accept one this

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,600
can accept many so what we need to do is

121
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,120
take the output of our original mesh and

122
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,560
then feed it over to here and now we

123
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,160
have both the original mesh and we have

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
our points and they're being combined

125
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,039
together and then put into our output

126
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,960
okay very cool awesome all right so if

127
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,639
we were to give this a render right now

128
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,039
you would actually see nothing because

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
these points don't physically exist they

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,039
just exist in the 3D space if we want

131
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,160
them to show up in the render we have to

132
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,280
tell it what do you want to render them

133
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,120
as so for that we need to add an object

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,600
to be our sprinkle so your sprinkle

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,360
could be whatever you want uh we're

136
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
actually going to make two different

137
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,919
types of sprinkles in this uh donut

138
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,240
Series so we're going to start though

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
with a very simple one just a round ball

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,160
so uh just like you would add another

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
object normally shift a and then go mesh

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
and then go UV sphere now this sphere is

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,120
going to be referenced for every single

144
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,759
sprinkle okay so we want to go uh as low

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,199
res as we can get away with uh so I'm

146
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,160
going to go with a 12 segments and then

147
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,800
eight Rings if you're on a really slow

148
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,039
computer and you think this is really

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,720
going to suffer later on um you could go

150
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,280
even lower but I don't want to go too

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,600
low because otherwise we're going to see

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,360
that Jagged Edge cuz it's a rounded form

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
so I don't want to go too much lower

154
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,520
than that uh but I do want to adjust the

155
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,960
scale because obviously this needs to be

156
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,199
a tiny little sprinkle so let's go

157
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,479
0.1 okay awesome all right now with our

158
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
icing selected again you'll notice by

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,360
the way that if you click another object

160
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,160
you don't see your nose because it's

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
only going to show you the active

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
objects geometry nodes so if you want

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,280
the nodes to just be there no matter

164
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,800
what if you click the pin button there

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
that means no matter what is selected

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,560
it's only going to be showing you this

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,199
objects uh the one that we pinned uh

168
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,240
geometry noes okay all right so to

169
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
reference we need to reference that

170
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
little sphere that we've just created in

171
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
our geometry node system and you can do

172
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,560
it very easily just by dragging down

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
from your outliner up here just dragging

174
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,039
it down into your geometry nodes and

175
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,440
dropping it okay so now let's just

176
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,039
create some room here make a little bit

177
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,840
of

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,520
space okay and what I need to do is add

179
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
another node to reference this object

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,720
and the node is shift a instances

181
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,560
instances on points the top one okay and

182
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
then I want to drop it in here between

183
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
distribute points on faces and my join

184
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
geometry so drop it in right there till

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
it lights up now the points have

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
disappeared because we're now saying

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
replace those points with whatever is in

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
that instance input so I'm going to take

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,000
my geometry from my object info and drag

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,759
it into the instance and look at that we

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,039
have got our spheres appearing all over

192
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,720
it and if I increase the density we've

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,440
got sprinkles and if I do a render it

194
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,879
will actually display doesn't look very

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,160
good hey but it does work which is the

196
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
uh the main thing right now okay so uh

197
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,039
first things first you'll notice that as

198
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,840
we increase the density first problem is

199
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
that uh they're crowding each other they

200
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,639
are straight up overlapping each other

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,360
with no respect for its fellow sprinkle

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,199
right because it's just a random

203
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,319
distribution so we can change that by

204
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,080
going here in our distribute points on

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,960
faces change it from random distri dist

206
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,560
distribution to Pon disc distribution

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Pon what a name um so it's changed uh

208
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,199
but that's just because it's changed

209
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,159
your density Max so just increase it

210
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,240
again um with this pron dis uh

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,039
distribution you get this extra value

212
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,240
here distance Min so now if we can uh

213
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,400
set a low value we can start to delete

214
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
it's it's almost like each one of those

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,599
points is going to have a little radius

216
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,479
around it and if it detects a point

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,039
within that radius it's going to delete

218
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,599
it so um we just need to increase it

219
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,559
slowly very very slowly until we can't

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,120
see them intersecting anymore um to

221
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,880
about there

222
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,560
honestly if you go too high like if you

223
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
really wanted to make sure they weren't

224
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,560
touching you go really high but it

225
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,240
starts to look like too evenly spaced

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,200
you know like yeah it's it's not

227
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,440
actually registering the other object

228
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
it's like it's just doing this little

229
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,399
radius thing which just happens to be

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,519
perfect for a ball-shaped object but

231
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,279
it's not like an advanced like it's

232
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,120
going to try to fill in all the gaps for

233
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,079
you um so yeah just kind of I usually

234
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,640
set it to like a little bit of clipping

235
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
is okay but I don't want there to be uh

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,680
too much um but let's go yeah something

237
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't know something like that we'll

238
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,440
actually adjust this later on I'm just

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,800
doing it just for this this point all

240
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,959
right a much bigger problem if I hit

241
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,600
control tab to go full screen here if I

242
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,160
look at uh at my mesh I've got sprinkles

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,839
everywhere and in fact I've actually got

244
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,800
sprinkles underneath the icing and

245
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,040
that's not good because it's actually

246
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
going to put that in the render even

247
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,240
though you won't see it your computer is

248
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,000
going to use resources to render little

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
individual balls underneath the icing

250
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,279
which is not what we want obviously so

251
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,160
going back here what we need to do to

252
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
fix this is we need to do weight

253
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,800
painting okay it's not texture painting

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
it's a special thing called weight

255
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,079
painting So with your icing selected if

256
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
you go from your object mode you'll see

257
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,519
one there called weight paint now your

258
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,560
mesh will become blue and weight paint

259
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,240
is actually referenced in multiple parts

260
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,600
of blender like if you're doing rigging

261
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
and animation you would use weight

262
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,000
painting a lot during the rigging step

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
to assign values to certain bones

264
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,760
essentially what it's doing is it's

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,680
allowing you to paint a value between

266
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,320
zero and one onto any part of the mesh

267
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,279
and then reference that however you want

268
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,640
so we can then reference that weight

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,519
paint mask in our geometry nodes and use

270
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,320
this almost as well exactly as a mask

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
for our uh

272
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,279
sprinkles so if we just do uh just do

273
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,800
some paint right here on it you'll see

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,279
that we have some colors right now these

275
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,639
colors aren't going to appear in the red

276
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,480
it's just for you to visualize those

277
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,440
values uh the blue value means a zero a

278
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,360
value of zero and the red value is a

279
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,639
zero of one I believe actually in maybe

280
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,720
not the next version of blender but

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,000
maybe the version I don't know but

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
they're planning to change the colors of

283
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
this so depending on the value on how

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
late watching this you are your colors

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
might be different here but it should be

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,560
the same essentially you should have a

287
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,320
brush of one um and you should be able

288
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
to paint from zero which would give a

289
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,720
blue value in this case to a value of

290
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,240
one so whatever is one whatever is red

291
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,480
is where our sprinkles will go but

292
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,279
you'll notice that this is not having

293
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,320
any effect okay so we need to reference

294
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,760
it now that weight paint that we just

295
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,320
did is actually if we go to our data tab

296
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,920
here it's actually a Vertex group okay

297
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
so that's where that paint went so you

298
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
could actually create multiple weight

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,240
paint types just by like creating them

300
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
here um but we've just created one and

301
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,440
it's added one here for us so we can

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,800
give it a name by double clicking it and

303
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
let's call it sprinkle mosque okay in

304
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,839
fact it's a is it a Mosk it's more of a

305
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
density sprinkle density I guess cuz

306
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
it's not a masking out anyway all right

307
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,560
sprinkle density um okay and where I

308
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
want to reference this in my geometry

309
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,320
node stack is in the distribute points

310
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
on faces there is one value here called

311
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,440
density factor which we got when we use

312
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,519
the presson dis thing and this is just a

313
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,480
value of 0 to one very convenient so if

314
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
I drag out from here and then release I

315
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,880
can add in a new node and it'll just

316
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,320
automatically connect it and the node

317
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,480
that you're looking for is called the

318
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,839
named attribute don't feel bad if you're

319
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,839
like well how would I know that it's

320
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,040
called the named attribute cuz it's

321
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,240
called vertex groups over here you think

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,480
like okay I'm going to type in vertex

323
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,839
group but it's an attribute but it's one

324
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,959
of many attributes and geometry nodes

325
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,120
can do many things so it's just called

326
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,399
the named attribute so anyways all right

327
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,279
so underneath name we're just going to

328
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,880
click that box you'll get a pop up or

329
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,720
pop down and you looking for sprinkle

330
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,959
density and there it is haha so now

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,560
going back into weight paint mode we can

332
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,160
act like an artist and put the sprinkles

333
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
wherever we want sprinkles on our donut

334
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,959
which is really cool um so so sprinkles

335
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,120
are typically they're like on a plate

336
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,959
and then the wet donut with icing on it

337
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,920
is just like dabbed onto it so you get

338
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
like a heavy amount of sprinkles right

339
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,800
on the top like that and then less

340
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,839
around the sides um and then I usually

341
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,120
do like a few like dabs like

342
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,800
this just for some variance and then

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,320
also if you hold down control that will

344
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,199
do a so the the weight that's being

345
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,120
painted is one but if I hold down

346
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,079
control it's going to do a negative

347
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,120
value and I can adjust my strength there

348
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
as well and I can just do some negative

349
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,519
uh paints across it maybe a couple here

350
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,240
as

351
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
well and I'm trying to deliberately make

352
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,079
it look choppy because I find that if

353
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,120
you make it look too like uniform then

354
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,600
it just looks very boring and artificial

355
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,560
um because the real world would have

356
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,440
more sprinkles collecting in certain

357
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
areas than others right maybe it's just

358
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,519
like wetter on that part right so more

359
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,240
would stick to it um or more force was

360
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
put on that part of the plate as the

361
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
doughnut was dabbed into it right you

362
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,720
just kind of have to think of this stuff

363
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,560
because uh in the digital world it's far

364
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,120
too easy to make something that looks um

365
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,600
predictable and boring and we don't want

366
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,399
that but there we go something like that

367
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,720
um and you could obviously finesse it

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
and make it better than what it is but

369
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,199
that's uh that's what we got uh you'll

370
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,079
notice each of these spheres have a very

371
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,040
Jagged looking shape and that's because

372
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
the sphere itself down here oh I don't

373
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,560
think I mentioned this if you want to

374
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,360
quickly Zoom to an object without having

375
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,000
to find it and pan around number pad

376
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,839
period key probably should have

377
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,360
mentioned that before um but we've only

378
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,519
haven't really needed it because we have

379
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,079
not work with that many objects but

380
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
that'll Focus to that object if you're

381
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,480
on a laptop by the way if you hold down

382
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,680
the Tia key that'll bring up this

383
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,160
section here and then you've got view

384
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,519
selected right there so tiller is that

385
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,079
key underneath your uh Escape key but

386
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,680
anyways so this is what our sphere looks

387
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
like so right click shade smooth and now

388
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
all those sprinkles have a shade smooth

389
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,199
haha very nice all right now let me just

390
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,000
show you a quick uh little issue that

391
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
you might run into if you were to uh

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,720
duplicate your donut and uh create two

393
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,440
and then on the second donut you're like

394
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,160
hey I want to have uh some spice in my

395
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
scene I don't want to have the exact

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,560
same count of sprinkles across both

397
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,480
Donuts let's give a a different value to

398
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,120
this one over here well you can see that

399
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,040
they are now sharing the same value

400
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,480
because this node group here is being

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,079
linked across both objects um but if you

402
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,920
wanted I mean you could like you know

403
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,759
make it its own single object so they're

404
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,959
not linked but if you wanted everything

405
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,120
else to to remain the same so that let's

406
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,680
say you you know change the sprinkle at

407
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
some point that's preserved across it

408
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,240
but that one value you want to be

409
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
different across multiple objects you

410
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,480
can expose it so just like what I did at

411
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,839
the start if I drag out from the value I

412
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
want to expose and then I put it up to

413
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
here in my group input the empty slot if

414
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,160
I just release it it's now disappeared

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
the value's disappeared from here and

416
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,880
it's now appeared in my modifier stack

417
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,000
over here and now I can put in a

418
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
different value so this has now got a

419
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,240
value of 2,000 and this one is 500 so

420
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,279
essentially by dragging it out and

421
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,639
exposing it it's essentially removing

422
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,759
the value from this uh node setup and

423
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,800
saying this is its own separate thing

424
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
which is independent per object um and

425
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,839
it has a two birds uh one stone kind of

426
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,800
effect that it makes it more accessible

427
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,079
so in a completely different part of

428
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,240
blender I'm working on my scene and I'm

429
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,160
just very quickly giving different

430
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,399
sprinkle amounts to different Donuts

431
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
right like a mad man right no one can

432
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,079
stop me um but yeah very cool and uh

433
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,759
that's now exposed oh the other thing we

434
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,920
probably want to do though with that uh

435
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,839
this group input here is I want to give

436
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,279
it a different name because density Max

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,160
you know not really that useful I can

438
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,040
call it sprinkle density right so now

439
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
it's like a fully customized little node

440
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
group that I could drop on any object I

441
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
could be building a car in the future

442
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,359
and I'm like it it needs sprinkles and I

443
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
can just drop this on and I've got a

444
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,799
Sprinkle density value for my car right

445
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,359
so you can see how geometry nodes you

446
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
can build something really customized

447
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,839
for what you want and then it's just

448
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,520
readily accessible um every time you

449
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,919
need to use it awesome now one issue

450
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,359
that I will show you with this and

451
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,160
actually it's not specific to Geometry

452
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,119
noes but this entire time for all these

453
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,960
videos

454
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,000
we've been building a dut which is too

455
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,160
big so if you hit n in your properties

456
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,280
oh that's the polygon thing uh you can

457
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,720
see the size the dimensions of your dut

458
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,640
is 1.2x 1.2 M which uh for Americans oh

459
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,960
actually yeah you can change it you

460
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
could change your units to the wacky

461
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,039
Imperial one yeah four feet right okay

462
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,039
um which is way too big okay now why

463
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,720
does it matter right because like okay

464
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,600
if you're looking at this this how are

465
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,440
you to actually know that this is 1.2 M

466
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,559
rather than the regular size zut it

467
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,600
doesn't actually matter yet but when we

468
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
get to like rendering with depth of

469
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,480
field or maybe you want to import other

470
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,240
objects from other scenes having a value

471
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,400
that is actually true to the object will

472
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,440
save you so much time and it'll also

473
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,200
make it so that your camera settings Etc

474
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,880
are actually correct so that bit is uh

475
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
is very important so essentially we

476
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,039
should resize this and really a real

477
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,679
donor is about 12 CM which is exactly

478
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,760
1/10th of what we've got right here so

479
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,360
if we select everything in the entire

480
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
scene which you can do by just hitting a

481
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,640
a for everything I don't know a for all

482
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,840
yeah that makes more sense okay uh then

483
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,120
if we hit s to scale okay we're now in a

484
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,480
scale oh actually okay well now it's

485
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,159
going to scale it and the plane is going

486
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,159
to be off the ground hm okay all right

487
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,039
well let's not let's not scale the lamp

488
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,120
and the the camera so everything else

489
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,640
selecting the donut the lamp sorry the

490
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,640
donut the plane and the sphere then s

491
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,679
and then I want to scale it by exactly

492
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,120
10% now how could I do that if you look

493
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,200
in the top leftand Corner you've got uh

494
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,039
the values there and if I if I went to

495
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,960
0.1 then it would be exactly a tenth of

496
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,320
what it was but how can I get it exactly

497
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,520
at 0.1 well uh two things one if you

498
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
hold down control when you're moving any

499
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,520
value in blender it'll move it in

500
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,720
increments which in this case is 0.1 but

501
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
you can also actually just type in the

502
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,880
exact value you want point one and hit

503
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,520
enter and now if we look at the size of

504
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,039
our donut Click N Hit N uh you can see

505
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,840
it's

506
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,440
.12 M or centim you know anyway um and

507
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
that's great but there is a problem uh

508
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
what you might notice I mean there's not

509
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,760
a problem now but when you change the

510
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,520
scale or the rotation of object actually

511
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,960
it's uh it's not it's only changed its

512
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,919
uh what do you call it its local scale

513
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,120
it hasn't actually applied it on a

514
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,960
global level yet so the sprinkle here

515
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,000
and the dut have actually got a like

516
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,960
pretend value this scale is set at 0 2

517
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,240
and it's almost like it's saying to the

518
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,480
scene that's not its real scale it's

519
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,799
just been faked to be that size yet it

520
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,640
needs to be applied if you want to like

521
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,159
confirm really that this is the true

522
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,159
scale of rotation of the thing and you

523
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,280
do that by selecting the things and then

524
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,880
hitting contr a and then applying

525
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,240
scale okay so now we've done that we can

526
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,520
see something's changed so our donut

527
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
here with the sprinkles has now

528
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
massively changed its uh density count

529
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,880
and the reason for this is that if we go

530
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,799
geometry nodes again let's zoom in here

531
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,440
let's look at it with

532
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,919
this this density this sprinkle density

533
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,000
is actually not the count of sprinkles

534
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,440
at all it's the density in relation to

535
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,320
the whole scene and the way I think of

536
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,280
it is like um uh okay it's a weird

537
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,919
visualization but if you've got a car

538
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
and it's driving along a highway right a

539
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,120
certain amount of bugs are going to hit

540
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,880
the windshield okay but and the bugs

541
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,440
could be defined by here but the smaller

542
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,240
the object is right you could have the

543
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,880
same amount of bugs going across the

544
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,520
highway but if it was like a tiny

545
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Matchbox car there's going to be very

546
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,960
few bugs that's going to hit it okay so

547
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,600
the density is kind of like the density

548
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
of the world and now that we've made the

549
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,559
object smaller there's only three

550
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,600
sprinkles left there's only three bugs

551
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
that's hit the windshield of our of our

552
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,840
donut here so this value now needs to be

553
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,120
much bigger in fact it needs to be

554
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,679
exactly like if it was 6,000 before it

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,799
needs to be yeah 60,000 now um but the

556
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,799
problem is is that it's not just a value

557
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,760
here the distance Min value has also

558
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,480
changed because this is also based on a

559
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,279
real world value so this now needs to be

560
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,120
really small so let's try

561
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,520
01 and that's actually pretty good I

562
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
think there's a little bit of over lot

563
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,440
but that's roughly kind of what we want

564
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,080
and let's see if I can increase this

565
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,960
yeah so if I want this density to be

566
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,600
really dense yeah I would have to

567
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,360
increase it to a crazy number now

568
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,919
something I like to do personally this

569
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,000
isn't you have to do this but you notice

570
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
how like this number is really large and

571
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,799
if I want to increase or lower my

572
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,600
sprinkle value and I'm in a different

573
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,799
part of blender if I'm just dragging

574
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,240
this value it's having no effect because

575
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,520
the the range like the scale of it is

576
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,520
just so large so what I actually do is I

577
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
set it to a value that I think makes

578
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,200
sense which in this case is 200 and then

579
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,520
whatever the value was before it was uh

580
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,440
200,000 right I do a math value inside

581
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,919
of my geometry node setup between here

582
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,720
and here I do a math calculation to

583
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,960
multiply that by the value that it needs

584
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,799
to be almost as like a scale adjustment

585
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,760
so you can do it with just one node

586
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,320
shift a utilities math math and just

587
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
drop it in here now the math I I said I

588
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,840
want to multiply it so I need to change

589
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,919
it from add to a multiply and math is

590
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,919
the most versatile of any uh node you

591
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,400
can do all sorts of stuff but multiply

592
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,520
so multiply and it was 200,000 before so

593
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,159
if I want this value 200 then I just

594
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:31,000
add uh 1,000 yes that's correct okay so

595
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,360
now I can very quickly change the scale

596
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,600
of the sprinkles across the donut

597
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,679
without having to like manually type in

598
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,200
the value I can just move it back and

599
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,159
forth um and there you go so that's it

600
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,520
so we've uh we've changed the scale of

601
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,960
it to what it should be um we've got a

602
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,080
correct uh density sorry we've got a

603
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,279
correct sprinkle setup looking good um

604
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,840
in the next part we are going to be

605
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,120
adding long sprinkles to donut because

606
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,640
this round one is okay and I originally

607
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,880
was just going to go round to try and

608
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,360
keep it simple but there's also I don't

609
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,919
know the long sprinkles just look way

610
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,720
nicer um but you do have to do uh some

611
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,279
different rotation math and stuff so

612
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,600
we're going to do that in a whole second

613
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,480
video so click here on the screen to

614
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,559
learn all about that and random colors

615
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,400
so I will see you in that part
