1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,839
this is where we finished at the end of

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,720
the last part um and we are ready for

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,320
some materials before we continue do a

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,360
check over though because I looked

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,680
inside my dut and I saw

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,480
this which shouldn't be here obviously

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,439
so make sure you don't have any hidden

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,800
meshes that should definitely not be

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,599
there you've only got your camera your

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,519
donate your icing and your light okay

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,080
okay so materials let's do some

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,320
materials if we jumped into our render

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,280
mode that little uh button that I showed

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,520
you on the first part that takes you

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,239
into rended View mode you can see we've

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
got a lamp and it's lighting our dut in

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,600
a very depressing cold gray so let's

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,399
give it a material down here the little

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,039
material Tab and then we're going to hit

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,280
new so just like before the one thing

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,960
we're going to change is the color let's

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,600
make it a nice pink color

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,920
and that looks pretty good the other

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,239
value that you typically want to change

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,439
um for a lot of objects is the roughness

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,840
value so you can see the further I go

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,759
all the way to the left hand side the

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,840
more it becomes a mirror so all the way

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
at zero is basically a mirror um and

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,479
then all the way to the right is your

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,799
like most porous object uh like a brick

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,040
or something like that basically

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,159
something that looks like it doesn't

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,960
have a reflection although everything

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,320
does um the roughness is uh is just

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,520
merely ipating that reflection um

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,759
everywhere so it appears as though it

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,479
doesn't but anyways so we're going to go

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,840
with like a point uh yeah 3 something

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
like that that's pretty good and then

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
for the base of our donut we're going to

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,799
give it uh another material and let's go

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,439
with a nice orangey yellow which we will

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
change later on so it won't matter

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
anyway um but that's good great look at

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,719
us we've got a donut by the way we'll

47
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,079
add some

48
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,119
subsurface SSS later on uh to make this

49
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,560
look a little bit more milky but for now

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,320
this is good now we want to put put our

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
donut onto a marble countertop so first

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
of all we need that countertop as a

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,878
separate object so shift a and the one

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
we're looking for is again under mesh

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
and we're going to go with a plane so a

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,400
plane is just a square um that's

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,080
literally made up of four vertices it's

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,800
the simplest object but the most

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,360
versatile that you use it all over the

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
place and I'm going to make this look a

61
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
little bit bigger so let's just scale

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,280
that out with s and then click okay so

63
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
we want to make our donut rest on to the

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
countertop so if I selected my donut

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,879
base and moved it up well there's a

66
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,920
problem right we need to have both of

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,319
these move together so if you want to

68
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,959
have one object basically attached to

69
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,800
another object while still being its own

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,080
separate object um you parent it so the

71
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,879
way we parent it is first of all you

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,519
select the object that you want to

73
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,239
follow the other object so the child um

74
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,440
and then you select the parent so

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,159
holding down shift I'm going to now

76
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,879
click on the donut base and then to

77
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,400
parent its control p key okay or again

78
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,319
if at any time you don't know what it is

79
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,640
just hit F3 for search and then we can

80
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,400
just type in parent now by the way with

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,879
uh with parent you get a number of

82
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,000
options here uh the one you actually

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,959
want is keep transform if you just do

84
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,879
object it means if you've ever moved the

85
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,799
object like off its base or whatever

86
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,680
like that it'll then like clear its

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
position so it's actually not the one

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
you want most of the time so it's keep

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,159
transform now that I've done that if

90
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,680
you've done it in the correct order you

91
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
should be able to select the base and

92
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,000
then move it and the icing should go

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,640
with it if it doesn't it means it's

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,519
probably parented the other way so again

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,920
make sure the the object you want to

96
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
follow the other one is selected first

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,080
and then the parent is selected last

98
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,480
okay so now I'm going to move that up

99
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,519
along it Z axis so G and then just a

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,280
middle tap and pull it up till it's

101
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,680
resting on my counter haha lovely now

102
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
don't worry about this looking like

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,799
cartoonishly bad in terms of realism I'm

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,360
going to show you um a button later on

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,079
which is is going to make this look

106
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,360
phenomenally realistic um that's going

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,959
to be in some later Parts uh but for now

108
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,040
this is fine just whilst we work and uh

109
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,280
piece the scene together so for our

110
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,799
countertop here we need to give it a new

111
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,879
material and then underneath the base

112
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,560
color you can select not just a color by

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,279
clicking the the color but the Little

114
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,399
Dot next to it that little yellow thing

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
doesn't look like a button it is if you

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,639
click that you get this uh this pop up

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,160
or pop down in this point uh which uh

118
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
just gives you a number of options and

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
the one that we're looking for is image

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,199
texture so essentially it's replacing

121
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,000
that input from a flat color to an image

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,680
texture property and it's now black and

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
it's asking you what image texture so we

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,320
need an image texture now we could go to

125
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,320
uh just Google images and just find any

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,960
old marble texture download that uh the

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,680
problem usually with uh textures on the

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,120
web is that what most people call A

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
texture is not ideal for 3D most

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
textures are good for websites but for

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
3D we need extra information to tell the

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,479
3D software how the material property

133
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,080
looks like how does it reflect light uh

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
what are the bumps look like across the

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,360
surface and all that information is

136
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,560
never available on these sites so to

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,120
find those texts you have to go to a

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,800
separate dedicated website and the

139
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,199
website that I recommend is polygon and

140
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,120
the reason I recommend it is because

141
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,360
it's mine it's my website it's why I

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
recommend

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,080
it uh no I started eight years ago

144
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
because I was uh pretty dissatisfied

145
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,479
with the quality of the texture websites

146
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,800
that were available at the time so I

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
used my YouTube money to invest in a

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
team and some high-tech equipment we

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,720
went out into the world and we scan

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
stuff to a very high quality standard

151
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,319
and over the years we've grown it to

152
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,880
include uh models and hdris as well and

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,080
obviously a lot of this stuff is paid um

154
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,919
but we also have a free range and

155
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
obviously we're going to be using a free

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,039
Texture for this part so this is the

157
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,240
free Texture this is the one we're going

158
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,400
to use use and first of all although it

159
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
is free you need to sign up for an

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,919
account so you can just sign up with

161
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,520
Google that's usually the easiest one

162
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,360
it's a couple of onboarding questions uh

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,400
I would like to actually know how you uh

164
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,880
you know are you a professional are you

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
a student that's kind of interesting to

166
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,599
me to know that and then when you get to

167
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,720
here just going to say continue with

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
free account but pal through that um and

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
if you click the link in the description

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
again this is the marble and we just

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,319
want to hit download and you'll see in

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,479
the bottom right hand corner it's

173
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,400
downloading it is a large size but this

174
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,919
because it's 8 K and we've got maps that

175
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,560
like 16bit depth um to get all of that

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,160
accurate information there but once it

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
is finished it'll just appear in your

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
downloads then you just unzip the zip

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
file as you would normally and then

180
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,560
finally you should see some glorious

181
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,880
high resolution images and ones with

182
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,160
extra information like roughness very

183
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,599
very subtle but we'll come through when

184
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,240
we do the rendom so back into blender

185
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
where we've got that image texture we're

186
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,639
going to click on open then navigate to

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,960
where you unzipped it and then just

188
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,039
click on the one that's ends uh with C

189
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,720
in the name and then just hit open and

190
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,400
here it is okay and it looks great up

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,879
close only problem is of course look at

192
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,039
that reflection so Bland so fake and as

193
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
I mentioned before fake is the enemy and

194
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,360
you need to uh squash it by just adding

195
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,759
variant so that's where our roughness

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,639
map is going to come in and while we

197
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,120
could try to add it in here this section

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
on the right hand side it's actually not

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,400
where you do most of your material work

200
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,800
because this is kind of like a

201
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,080
simplified dumb down version it doesn't

202
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,639
really it's it gets a little bit

203
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,919
complicated when you try and add too

204
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,160
many things to it cuz there's like too

205
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
many menus and drop downs and all that

206
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
kind of stuff so instead if you go to

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
your shading tab at the top of the

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,759
screen there this will change the layout

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
of the screen to something completely

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
different we haven't seen before and

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
lots of Windows actually too many I

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
never actually need this one on the

213
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
right hand side so where you just Mouse

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
over where you've got the divider and

215
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,000
then just right click and then say join

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
areas and then you want want to join it

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,879
to the left to close it and then I'll do

218
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,080
the same here cuz I've never needed

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,800
those on the left hand side so I've just

220
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,560
got my view at the top here and then

221
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,479
this one here and the Reason by the way

222
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,240
this looks different um than what we had

223
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,159
before is because this is the material

224
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,800
preview but you can change it back to

225
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
what we had before by clicking that so

226
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,879
material preview by the way it's the

227
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,479
same it's it's a rendered mode but it's

228
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,520
using uh lights a Different Light setup

229
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
basically just an hdri which is like a

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
fake kind of light and reflection map

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,879
just so that you can quickly preview

232
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,000
materials and really you could use

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
either or um they both kind of show the

234
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,399
material but yeah let's use this one

235
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,760
okay but the bit that we're looking for

236
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,599
is here so this section here is your

237
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,480
node setup and it's actually an exact

238
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,800
duplicate of what we did over here

239
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
because this on the right hand side is

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
the simplified version if you're just

241
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
doing like a quick change you might want

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
to use this but over here this is what's

243
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
actually happening to it underneath the

244
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,240
hood right so you can see as I change

245
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
this on the right hand inside that is

246
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,600
also changing there so they are linked

247
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
so the way nodes work is basically a

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,920
left to right function so we start over

249
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
here with our image texture it goes into

250
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,880
our Shader which is the material for uh

251
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
this plane and then it comes out into a

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,040
material output and that's what is fed

253
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,680
into the final uh Shader so essentially

254
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,480
we could put we could do anything like

255
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
for example and this is one of the value

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,680
of nodes is between these two nodes we

257
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
could add another node like for example

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
I could hit shift a to add again same

259
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
hoty works everywhere and then I could

260
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,600
add in like a hue saturation value node

261
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,480
and then I could change the Hue of my

262
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,040
marble to look blue right or or

263
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,440
something else um so that's the power of

264
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
nose and you could just keep going

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,079
adding in adjustments and everything you

266
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,880
want um so nodes very very flexible um

267
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
they do look daunting because they get

268
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,640
all these like you know squid looking

269
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,320
lines going everywhere um but it's very

270
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,680
very convenient very customizable okay

271
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
but we want to add something to our

272
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
roughness so so that we don't have a

273
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
flat uh single value roughness which is

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,600
what that is currently we want to use

275
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
that map that we just downloaded so uh

276
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
one you could hit shift a and then add

277
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,560
an image text this way but actually we

278
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,360
could also just drag out from that input

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,800
there and then just do a release and

280
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,440
it'll now say what do you want to add in

281
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
this input and we could type in image

282
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,959
texture color and then hit uh enter Then

283
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,240
here go to that same place that we

284
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,959
unzipped it and then we're looking for

285
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,240
the one with roughness in the name so

286
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440
Ness in the name and then hit open okay

287
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
so this is better right you can kind of

288
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
see we've got some detail there but it

289
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
doesn't look quite right something is

290
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,000
not going right um it's because when you

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
add an image texture um blunder doesn't

292
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,519
really know what type of information it

293
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,279
is yet and by default it's looking at

294
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
the color information is though there

295
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
even though there isn't really color

296
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,880
there so instead we need to tell blender

297
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,760
this is a special map and we're just

298
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,160
looking at the values right so

299
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,800
essentially the color space here we need

300
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,880
to change it from srgb where it's a

301
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,399
standard photo color to instead

302
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,800
non-color data or just non- color I

303
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,760
guess they've changed it um but now you

304
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,200
can see that looks correct right so look

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
at all that we got scratches we got

306
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,880
smudges it's infinitely more realistic

307
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,240
uh than what we had

308
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,639
previously so beyond that though we

309
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,440
could also add in little tiny bumps okay

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,680
so bumps are in a place you would not

311
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,360
expect there's not a bump value here

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
it's actually under normal so normal you

313
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,399
hear that word a lot in 3D it just

314
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,600
basically means the face which direction

315
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,399
is the face pointing right so if this is

316
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,040
your face of the plane you're pointing

317
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
this way that's the normal right but you

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
can change the normal information to

319
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,040
kind of tweak it to pretend like there

320
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,519
is detail in that okay essentially we

321
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,800
can plug in a specialized map called a

322
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,240
normal map okay so we're going to drag

323
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,920
out from that normal map and then relas

324
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,760
release and then image texture that's

325
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,800
the last used thing that's the one we

326
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,440
want I'm just going to click color then

327
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
drop and then hit open go to that same

328
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,240
folder and then this is the one the

329
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,560
purple one it's the weirdest looking map

330
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,399
you always know you're looking at a uh a

331
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,160
CG texture map directory cuz it's the

332
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,279
purple one and it's got nrm in the name

333
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,639
for normal and hit open and just like

334
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,279
before it's not going to be correct

335
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
because it it thinks this is a color

336
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
image texture just like for photos so we

337
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,800
need to change it again to non-color

338
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,120
data and now you would think that would

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,440
fix it but no it looks even worse what

340
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,680
did we do the problem is is we need to

341
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
convert this image texture into

342
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
something this can read so we need to

343
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,199
put another node in between here so the

344
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,279
node is found under shift a a for add

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,199
then Vector normal map so click and then

346
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,760
just drop it here so it highlights

347
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,800
between it and then just drop it and it

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,480
will now finally be correct and if I go

349
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
full screen with control space I didn't

350
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,600
mention that before but yeah control

351
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,000
space and then you can uh Go full screen

352
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,360
and you can see we've got very subtle

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,920
little little chips and divots across

354
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,279
the texture along with those smudges and

355
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,800
uh it just looks way more believable

356
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,959
means you don't have to worry about this

357
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,279
part of your scene it's just going to

358
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,920
work and you're going to get all that

359
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,480
detail for free and um just makes life a

360
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
little bit easier but it is a lot of

361
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,920
work like what you've just made is a PBR

362
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,639
Shader and yeah it's it's a lot of work

363
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,199
all those little maps and everything and

364
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,839
having to know which setting is which um

365
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
but it is a very common thing to learn

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,800
so that's why I wanted to include it in

367
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,760
here um if I could plug my own website

368
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,519
again though I will say we did hear you

369
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,399
cuz a lot of people say that so we

370
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,120
actually made an add-on called the

371
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
polygon add-on which I'll actually show

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,199
you how to install later on cuz that is

373
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,279
actually important for 3D cuz you use a

374
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,519
lot of add-ons but to plug it very

375
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,160
quickly it actually does all of that

376
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,759
without you having to leave blender so

377
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,320
it'll download the texture for you there

378
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,000
we go see it's uh downloading it's

379
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,759
actually faster through the add-on and

380
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,320
then once you've got it you just hit

381
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,040
apply and then it will do all of that

382
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,920
node work for you in the background and

383
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,600
it'll just apply it to the mesh for you

384
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,199
um so you don't have to do all that all

385
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
the time and in fact most people I think

386
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,800
if you're working on Big scenes you're

387
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,320
using libraries uh you're using add-ons

388
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,480
like this so you don't have to do it all

389
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,800
manually all the time but it is

390
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
important to know the process so that's

391
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,160
why I wanted to show it but anyways this

392
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,199
was our material and we are happy with

393
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,320
it well done let's go back to the layout

394
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,680
tab and now we're going to do one more

395
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,440
thing so you see our dut base here let's

396
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,240
just isolate this doughnut for one

397
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
moment here by hitting forward slash

398
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,480
which I mentioned previously okay when

399
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
you're in forward this is isolate mode

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
which means it's literally turning off

401
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,079
everything including the lamp which is

402
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,040
why it's dark but if you turn on

403
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,279
material preview then you get this so

404
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,199
this is okay uh but if you look look at

405
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,519
real references of donuts you'll see

406
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,720
that it's typically whiter around the

407
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
middle and the reason for that is as I

408
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
mentioned before the way it Cooks right

409
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
it's only like half submerged and then

410
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,360
it's flipped and it means that the bits

411
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
that are closest to the surface are

412
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
cooked less so there's usually like a

413
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,040
whiter part around the rim and I mean

414
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,240
really this is just an excuse to show

415
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,839
you another part of blender which is

416
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,000
texture paint so at the top there click

417
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,079
the texture paint tab and again let's go

418
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,519
into isolate mode with our donut there

419
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,519
um why are we not seeing okay there we

420
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,560
go so what texture paint uh does it lets

421
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,759
you paint directly onto your mesh but if

422
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,519
we try doing it you can see nothing's

423
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,839
happening and it does give you a warning

424
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,040
at the body missing textures detected so

425
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,079
to paint you're painting into an image

426
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,399
and the image doesn't exist yet so we

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,800
have to give it one so go to the

428
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,120
material Tab and then here where we got

429
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,000
base color we set it up as yellow but

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,160
we're actually just going to override it

431
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,560
now so click that little yellow dot

432
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,440
again and then say image texture so now

433
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
it's black doesn't have an image so and

434
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,680
instead of clicking open we're going to

435
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,399
click new so we're going to be creating

436
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,880
a brand new image and let's call this

437
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,279
donut base we could make this higher res

438
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,959
if we want but don't this is more than

439
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,480
enough for a donut base that's fine and

440
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
uh this will just save us time to color

441
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,000
this will just fill the uh it'll fill

442
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,880
the the the image for us with a flat

443
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,319
color so going to go for something

444
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,839
pretty similar to what we had before a

445
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,319
nice yellowy color like that and by the

446
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,800
way make sure you're all the way bright

447
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
otherwise your donut is uh is going to

448
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
be a little bit dark so yeah there we go

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
all right and then hit okay and once

450
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,399
we've done that you should I mean it

451
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,959
should be over there on the Le hand side

452
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,560
but if it doesn't pop up you can just

453
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,199
select it from the drop down donut base

454
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:50,600
and there we go so now we're in this

455
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,959
state look what I can do ooh fancy so I

456
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,560
don't know why I said it like that um

457
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,480
but we can paint directly onto our mesh

458
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,839
so to understand this because it's kind

459
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,160
of weird you can also paint directly

460
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
over here and you might be thinking like

461
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,799
well how does it know like how do I know

462
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
which part over here is actually going

463
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,919
to be painted over onto the donut there

464
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,199
you might not care but it's uh it's

465
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,880
actually good to understand how it works

466
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,599
so basically this mesh here it has to be

467
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,160
unwrapped over onto this left hand side

468
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,599
here cuz that's the only way to uh have

469
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,640
a 2d texture 2D flat image be applied to

470
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,280
a mesh is to unwrap it in some way I

471
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,919
mean there's projection I'm not getting

472
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,640
into that uh to unwrap it and unwrapping

473
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
is essentially like there is a meme

474
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,760
actually that that explains it um but if

475
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,480
you have like a chocolate right that is

476
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,840
wrapped in some tin foil if you flatten

477
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,960
it out that is essentially UV unwrapping

478
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,640
there are are little places in that

479
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,400
wrapping where there had to be a cut

480
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,799
right and then that cut was wrapped

481
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,360
around the object that's what uvon

482
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,280
wrapping is so the reason this works for

483
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
us is because the cuts are actually

484
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,960
already in in place for default objects

485
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,039
so this Taurus is already perfectly UV

486
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,400
unwrapped so we don't have to do

487
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
anything I did want to mention it though

488
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,880
because it's important to understand UV

489
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,760
unwrapping anyways so we could actually

490
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,039
paint directly on here as I mentioned

491
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
white is a little bit too extreme though

492
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,559
so I'm going to click that and choose a

493
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,360
color first of all I'm going to select

494
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
the eye dropper and then not click over

495
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,760
here cuz that's got shading information

496
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,919
I'm going to click on the left hand side

497
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,240
so we get the exact color and then I'm

498
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,880
going to make it closer to White so not

499
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,679
fully white cuz that'll be too far but

500
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,679
closer to White and I'm also going to

501
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,640
change the strength of my

502
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
brush uh yeah I'll make about halfway

503
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
and then now I can do paints across it

504
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
and this will enable you to get a much

505
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,320
more natural feel um because you'll have

506
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,480
just like in fact I might even go a

507
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,400
little bit softer and that way you can

508
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
kind of just paint across it and this is

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
very forgiving because we've got icing

510
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
that's going to go over the top of it um

511
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
but that's good we don't want it to be

512
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,919
too too extreme let's just make it I

513
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,760
might go the other way make this a

514
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,400
little bit more saturated anyways that's

515
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,880
basically all we need to do we just want

516
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,200
to just dab our toes into the field of

517
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,320
uh texture painting I would say texture

518
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,679
painting by the way it's one of the

519
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,039
weaker areas of blender it's actually

520
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,520
due for an update at some point in the

521
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
future um but it doesn't do like you

522
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,720
can't paint into like the uh the height

523
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,960
information or the roughness information

524
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,200
at the same time like you can with

525
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,840
substance painter but

526
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,600
it's it's got basic functionality

527
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,440
now importantly this is an image but

528
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,720
it's not saved into your blend file it

529
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,159
still needs to be manually saved so see

530
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,960
at the top leftand corner there it's got

531
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
image with a star if you see that star

532
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,760
it means you've got changes that haven't

533
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
been saved so we need to go image and

534
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,159
then save and specify where are we going

535
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,960
to put our image because if we don't do

536
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,600
this uh we're going to lose it so it has

537
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,400
to be saved somewhere so I'm just going

538
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,120
to save it

539
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
yeah anywhere it has to be saved

540
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,679
somewhere because it will not be saved

541
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,159
as part of the blend fob very important

542
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,880
to know that otherwise you can lose

543
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,080
texture paint work that you've done but

544
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,039
there we go so now to bring back

545
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,600
everything remember if it looks like

546
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
where's the rest of my seene gone see

547
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
the top left hand corner local means

548
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,000
it's isolated mode so that means you

549
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
just have to hit forward slash again and

550
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,880
it brings back everything and there we

551
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,120
are so that's the extent of uh this part

552
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,480
of the tutorial as I mentioned the uh

553
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,440
some of you might be wondering when are

554
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
we going to make that lovely uh

555
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
subsurface scattering we're going to do

556
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
that in the future after we do the

557
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
sprinkles cuz it's too hard to see at

558
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,400
this point so there we go guys join me

559
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,559
in the next part and I'll see you there
