1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,600
congrats you didn't give up you made it

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,720
to part four you clicked on the next

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
part of the video there's always like

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,559
less viewers each uh video as you go

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,120
down so you're here well done thumbs up

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,280
um as you can tell by the title of this

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
video we're going to learn about

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,079
sculpting but first I should call out uh

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,480
if you have a problem with your mesh now

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,199
those problems can be Amplified the

11
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,279
further you go along so it helps to do a

12
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,359
technical check now make sure you don't

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,160
have any problems before we move along

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
so to look for it go into edit mode um

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,480
and first of all by the way if you can't

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,880
see that middle party of mesh it's

17
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,360
because you remember we temporarily hit

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,000
it so you can bring it back by hitting

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,239
alt H and that will uh bring back the

20
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,879
rest of the mesh and then we're looking

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,680
for issues with the mesh like right here

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,480
so this is a really common problem

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,120
following this tutorial because when

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,280
you're projecting parts of the mesh if

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
it was like side onto the camera it will

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,719
project it that way and then you can

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,039
have like overlapping parts of the mesh

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
so that creates this artifact here which

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,199
will be exaggerated when we add more

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,160
detail to it so we just want to drag

31
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,640
that back so turn on on snapping and

32
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,519
I'll keep proportional turned off and

33
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,720
then I'm just going to move this back

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,479
over here just to move each of these

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
points back um another very common

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
problem is you might have parts that

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
have separated uh from your mesh now you

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
can quickly fix this if you just like

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,439
selected the point and then T sorry hit

40
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,640
G to move it when you're in that state

41
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,159
it's also snapping it to the mesh now

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,400
you could do that all the way along like

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,520
select tap G then click select tap G

44
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,479
then click but that's

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
anybody's got time for that let's make

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,920
blend to do the work for us so there's a

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,840
tool that's just designed for this and

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,200
it's called the shrink wrap modifier so

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,040
over to our trusty modifier stack we're

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,079
going to add yet another modifier so add

51
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,399
modifier it's not under generate it's

52
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,439
under deform which we haven't accessed

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
before new modifiers oo the one we're

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,960
looking for is shrink wrap and first of

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,399
all hasn't done anything because uh it's

56
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,320
f it needs to know what the target is

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,360
what is the mesh that we're shrink

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,079
wrapping our um mesh too so with this

59
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,759
little eyedropper tool you can see when

60
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,679
you've clicked it my curs has changed to

61
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,280
an eyedropper and it now if I hover over

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
objects I got the name of it so I want

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
to click on the object that is the dut

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
and now it's snapped to the donut and

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,519
made it worse why Andrew would you make

66
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,480
us do that remember the order of your

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
modifier stack matters so the reason

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,879
this happened is because we've done it

69
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,840
after the solidifier M it works top toot

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
bottom we want the strink wrap to happen

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
before any of the Extrusion happens so

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,120
now that it's there it's correct and

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
this is what it looks like before and

74
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
this is after and it's subtle right and

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
you'll probably see this across your

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
mess like little subtle changes where

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,760
maybe it just separated off the mesh

78
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,080
which wasn't quite a perfect alignment

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,560
but this will just correct that so great

80
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
we don't need this here now we can just

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,599
apply it because it was just a once- off

82
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,440
operation and now all our mesh should be

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
perfectly flat and assuming you haven't

84
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,519
got any other issues going on uh again

85
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,159
make sure you use my Discord if you do

86
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,560
have issues and you need someone to help

87
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
um make use of the community so use that

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
and post your problem and I'm sure

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,360
people can help out all right so we want

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
to do some sculpting now why do we want

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
a sculpt well because if you look at

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,040
reference photos of um donuts with icing

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,599
on them you'll see that icing is

94
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,400
obviously a liquid and liquid does weird

95
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,319
things one of the weird things that it

96
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,159
does is that it will pull in certain

97
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,560
areas it's not like a uniform amount all

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,480
the way on it so the most obvious being

99
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,920
like at the end of this Trail here there

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
would be more that would accumulate at

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,480
the end there and I think the reason for

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,840
it is that because it's a viscous fluid

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,560
once it runs out of enough fluid there's

104
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
not enough to kind of push it forward

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
but there's enough for it to build up so

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
you would have like a buildup here on

107
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,519
each of these ends but you would also

108
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,519
have buildups all along the edge and you

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,120
can see it in reference photos like here

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,879
we've got this like clear um was it like

111
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,159
a glaze and basically the area there

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
where it looks whiter that's a thickened

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,079
area so we essentially want to replicate

114
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,040
that across our donut so we can't do

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,599
that currently like if you go into edit

116
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,000
mode we don't have any mesh to work with

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,400
cuz the Extrusion the thickened part is

118
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,519
happening via this modifier so we need

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
to make the modifier real so again we're

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,120
just going to apply it drop down apply

121
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,560
now in edit mode we have that part of

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
the mesh to work with so um we could if

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,320
you wanted to come in here and like

124
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,080
select SCT the points that you want to

125
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,880
add you know a bulge to and then very

126
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,600
carefully come in and tap G and then oh

127
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,840
I've got snapping turned on turn that

128
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,039
off uh pull this out right and go like

129
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,520
that and go yep there's a little bulge

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,840
there but that's very tedious to First

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
select a point then tap a key to move it

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
it's it's very tedious so that's really

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
like you just need to use another tool

134
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,720
to do the job so edit mode is one tool

135
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,199
and it's it's it's good for like very

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,479
precise things when you need to get

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,919
precise things but for more more like

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
organic shapes more freehand stuff

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,759
that's where sculpting comes in So at

140
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,240
the top here we've just been flipping

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
between object and edit mode but the one

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,680
underneath it is sculpt mode so when we

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,039
go into that mode you'll see that we

144
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,080
have on the left hand side all of these

145
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,319
tools that appear and I mean this isn't

146
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,800
a sculpting like tutorial really um

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,960
we're just really going to scratch the

148
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,080
surface but they do different things um

149
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,039
different sculpting things like let's

150
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
just use the default tool here can't

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
relase see much happen let's just turn

152
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,639
up the strength and the size of it like

153
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,840
it just pulls out that part of it and

154
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
even that quick little one stroke

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,960
imagine if you had to select each of

156
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,560
those points and pull them out one by

157
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,720
one like that's why this tool is the

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,600
appropriate tool for this kind of job

159
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
right because it's just very quickly

160
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
going to enable us to add lots of

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
complex shape very cool so uh the tool

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,280
that we're looking for is actually it's

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,680
this one the inflate brush which is just

164
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,280
uh conveniently the I hotkey

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
inflate by the way uh if you want to

166
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
change the size of brushes in uh blender

167
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,599
I mean you've got these ones here you've

168
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,560
also got the strength slider here but

169
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
there is a hot key uh just to change the

170
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,639
size of the brush with f so F to change

171
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,080
the the size of the brush um and you

172
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,639
just pull out with your cursor to make

173
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,919
it bigger and then pull in to uh reduce

174
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,360
it and then do a single left click to

175
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,599
confirm you can also change the strength

176
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,120
with shift F so shift F pull out click

177
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,080
and then shift F pull in in click um

178
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,280
anyways so if I was to uh draw on this

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
you can see that I'm inflating that edge

180
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,639
I could also inflate here but you very

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,720
quickly realize like look at that look

182
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,919
at that what is that right the eye is

183
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,720
going to see that um it's a pro tip your

184
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
ey is uh like if you're going low res

185
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
don't go low res for things that are

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
round because your eye is very quickly

187
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
going to spot uh low poly things

188
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,319
actually just last night I was playing

189
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,960
uh Spider-Man the Miles Morales one and

190
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
uh there was like this coffee cup that

191
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,800
was on a table and then you walk and it

192
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,960
looks fine like has a a background asset

193
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,360
but then part of it the mission you had

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,919
to go up and read something on the table

195
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,319
and you had to get close to this coffee

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,879
top uh coffee cup and it was like eight

197
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,240
vertices it just look like a almost look

198
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,400
like a nut on a wheel of a car right

199
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,720
just like that Jagged so anyways what

200
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm saying is this is a rounded form so

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
we need more information we need more

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,039
detail uh to sculpt on the reason this

203
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,440
is Jagged and the reason there's not

204
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,879
enough detail here is that just even

205
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,639
though we have a subsurf modifier a

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,879
subdivision modifier um it's applying it

207
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,960
after we do the sculpt mode so when

208
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,000
you're in sculpt mode it's still just

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,520
using your uh your raw mesh here and

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,560
then it does this as a secondary step so

211
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,960
if we want to sculpt into this detail we

212
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,800
need to apply this so um I actually I'm

213
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
going to use more than one I'm going to

214
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,800
use two cuz I want to have even more

215
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,639
detail so uh um importantly by the way

216
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,199
if you're applying a subdivision

217
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,360
modifier even though you've got two

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,400
levels here it will always use just the

219
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,080
viewport so your render amount here

220
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,280
could be whatever but when you hit apply

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
it's just going to apply whatever is in

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,599
the viewport so I'm going to go two

223
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,440
levels and hit apply now look at

224
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,479
this we have 16 times the detail because

225
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,240
we had uh level one which would be 4X a

226
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,720
4X uh multiply and then 4X of 4X 16 so

227
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,919
we have 16 times the vertices to play

228
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
with so now when we go into sculpt mode

229
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,679
look at it now when we sculpt look at

230
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,599
that so much more room to work with um

231
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,919
and much more fun so now that I'm in

232
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,600
that state I'm going to just do little

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
circles with this brush on each of these

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,920
points here and the reason I'm doing

235
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,839
like little circles like this is that uh

236
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
by default the stroke state is uh what

237
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,440
is it space um you can switch it to

238
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,160
airbrush if you you want and then you

239
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
can just click and hold it there but I

240
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
find that to actually be like harder to

241
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
control so I just keep it in space mode

242
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,279
and then just do like little circles and

243
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,880
then that enables you to just kind of

244
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,279
continue add adding more pressure as you

245
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,399
move your mouse so a little circle like

246
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,760
that and there you go very quickly

247
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,839
already we have a more

248
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,200
interesting uh looking shape across it

249
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,399
so another brush another tool I guess

250
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,160
you call is it a brush or I think it's

251
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,959
technically I cool brushes but anyways

252
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,440
another one that you use all the time is

253
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,959
grab um and conveniently it's the hotkey

254
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,440
G and what this does is just like

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
pushing clay with your finger it's

256
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,279
like it's really cool and the reason I'm

257
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
doing this is I'm actually just uh

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
exaggerating uh the design um because

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,160
that is what makes appealing design it's

260
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,800
exaggerating uh the addition and

261
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,079
subtraction that you see in a in a shape

262
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,120
even though in the real world you might

263
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
not see this like tapered thing like

264
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,640
that um because it's got this bulous end

265
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,279
you want to draw more attention to that

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,279
kind of globule at the end there um and

267
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,480
to do that yeah if you just make this a

268
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
little bit tapered using this tool it

269
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,399
can do that and we get to learn about a

270
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,480
new tool and blender which is the whole

271
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,640
point of this tutorial so yeah all right

272
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,440
pull this around pull this

273
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,640
around just clicking dragon click and

274
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,920
drag I could change the shape size of

275
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,000
the brush with f and um you've got more

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,720
time than me so maybe make this better

277
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,160
than what I'm doing really quickly but

278
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,920
just get you know generally a shape like

279
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,279
that and it should look a little

280
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,360
nicer okay so now let's do that uh

281
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,360
raised Edge all the way around the rim

282
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,480
of this now in previous versions of this

283
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
tutorial I said just use the inflate

284
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,880
brush and then just like draw across it

285
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
the problem with this is that this is so

286
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,160
imprecise and you can accidentally like

287
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,200
draw over another bit and then you look

288
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
at it side on and you get these like

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,920
noticeable like divots across the donut

290
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,240
and it's not very uh it's very hard to

291
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,639
do cuz you keep like accidentally

292
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,480
clicking off it and then on it and you

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
get this like Jagged like dig dig dig

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,399
dig dig it's not very appealing the

295
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,920
point is uh so let's go back we can

296
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,519
learn about another tool it's a it's

297
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,480
another excuse to learn about another

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,639
tool and that tool is called The Mask

299
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,839
tool so it's actually in the list here

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,040
but I never remember what it is it's

301
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,920
just hit M M for mask and it's this one

302
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,000
and what this enables you to do is uh if

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
you just draw on it you get this gray uh

304
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
shape right and then when you're using

305
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,320
another tool like say you switch to the

306
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,519
inflate brush now and if you draw over

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,600
this let me just increase this yeah if

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
you drew over this you can see it's it's

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,399
applying an inflation to everything

310
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,360
except the area that is dark um and

311
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,959
that's how you can create like you know

312
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,760
a skin lesion on a zombie or something

313
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,959
like that um so a mask is very useful in

314
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,399
sculpting used a lot and we're going to

315
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,120
use it in just this case what we're

316
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
going to do is mask out just this area

317
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,959
along the rim there and then we're going

318
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,639
to apply a constant inflate value to

319
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,240
just the area that we've masked so first

320
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,720
use the mask tool mask and it doesn't

321
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,440
really make sense to use like a half

322
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
opaque mask so we're going to set the

323
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
strength all the way to one and then

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
I'll use a brush size about here so

325
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,959
essentially where do I want the

326
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
inflation like do I want this much

327
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
inflation on the rim no probably

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
something about here and then I'm just

329
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
going to

330
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,040
paint a darkened value all the way

331
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,240
across it and I just want to make sure

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,120
that it's you know fairly even doesn't

333
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,800
have to be completely perfect but fairly

334
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
even across it and and I obviously don't

335
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,199
want it to be in this part because that

336
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,880
you know the liquid has flowed all the

337
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
way down and it's broken the trail and

338
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,480
it's gone down there so I don't want any

339
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,279
raised area there um and again I

340
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
apologize if this look like tedious but

341
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
it's a it's it's a way to learn blender

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
piece by piece okay hey hey speaking of

343
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,800
which um I

344
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,120
forgot with the uh sculpt Tools in

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,560
blender for whatever reason it has

346
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
assumed by default that you might want

347
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,320
to sculpt on the other side side of your

348
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,639
mesh so you can see I've got this smear

349
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,560
here um and that's because somewhere I

350
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,199
was painting over here I went through

351
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,480
the mesh and it painted on the other

352
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,320
side of the mesh over there very

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
annoying so um I can undo it it's just

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
easier than like repainting that whole

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
thing and what you want to do with your

356
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,320
M tool is underneath brush set it to

357
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,720
front faces only and that means when you

358
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
paint it should mean that as you draw oh

359
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
it will it okay it could still happen

360
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,959
just be careful uh but it should happen

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,480
less it shouldn't happen like on the

362
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
opposite side of the same mesh anyways

363
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,079
it should happen less um by the way I

364
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,120
didn't call it out cuz it's not

365
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,720
essential but if you do ever want to

366
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,480
isolate uh and only see the selected

367
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,519
object uh forward slash is the isolation

368
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,519
mode uh so forward slash on the number

369
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,800
pad or the actual normal keyboard will

370
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,600
pull you in and out of that state anyway

371
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
so now with the mask brush with front

372
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,839
faces only enabled uh I can paint along

373
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,720
it and uh and it should it should happen

374
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,000
less

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
essentially all right um I don't know

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
what to say but this doesn't take long

377
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,000
once you've uh once you've set it

378
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,279
up and assuming you've got the strength

379
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,639
of one by the way you don't want to have

380
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,600
areas with like half opaque right cuz we

381
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,279
want to have a constant value across it

382
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,040
as we inflate it and we should get a

383
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,680
nice raised Edge that goes all the way

384
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,880
along the donut okay okay great just

385
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,279
clean it off if you got any areas that

386
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,040
look a little untiy a little

387
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
uned

388
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,680
um yep awesome all right so as I

389
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,560
mentioned the mask will uh actually mask

390
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,079
out the area um so you can't paint on it

391
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,160
we obviously want to only paint on the

392
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,000
area that we mask so we want to invert

393
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,639
it by just hitting control I same hotkey

394
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,399
as Photoshop Etc and then obviously if

395
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,839
we went to the inflate brush and then we

396
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,040
just painted like yes we're only now

397
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
painting onto that area but it also

398
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,199
doesn't solve our problem of like

399
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,360
different values across it so we want to

400
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,160
apply a uniform inflation on just these

401
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,519
areas so there is a tool in the sculpt

402
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,079
tools

403
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,600
called where is it mesh

404
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,240
filter so I will be honest it's probably

405
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,399
the laziest implementation of a tool in

406
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,880
blend like mesh filters are not really

407
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,079
well documented you kind of have to just

408
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,399
learn how they work but unlike all these

409
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,120
other brushes here the way this one

410
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,160
works is it's applying a uniform value

411
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,680
to the entire mesh so it doesn't

412
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,560
actually matter where you click on the

413
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
mesh um it's going to apply it and it's

414
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
applying what is in the filter types

415
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,440
listed here so if I just click this is

416
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,759
the other thing you have to learn if I

417
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,279
drag to the right I'm inflating if I

418
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,720
drag to the left I'm deflating and sort

419
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,519
of subtracting the opposite direction um

420
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,680
you just kind of have to learn that

421
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,199
that's how this specific tool works my

422
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
theory is by the way to go on a rant

423
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,160
zbrush's user experience and interface

424
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,680
is so Arcane so badly hodg Podge

425
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,040
together from ideas over the last two

426
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,000
decades they never had any thought in

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
the process they just lumped it all in

428
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,440
there and blender sculpting tools

429
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,000
competes with that so they're like hey

430
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,639
yeah the uh filter tools yeah they're

431
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,440
not the easiest to understand but at

432
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
least we're not

433
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
zbrush that's my uh that's my theory

434
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
it's my working Theory I'm going with

435
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
but anyways point is is now that we're

436
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,799
in this you could see we're applying a

437
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,319
uniform value to everything hoay for us

438
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,640
um I might also I'm going to set the

439
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,760
strength of this to 0.1 and that just

440
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,599
means that as I move the cursor it's

441
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,039
applying less of a value for the for the

442
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,480
movement so I can use smaller movements

443
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,199
the other thing though is this is a

444
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,439
little like it almost looks if we go

445
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,119
into object mode looks like a tube

446
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,919
almost around the edge of it it's not

447
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
very nice um it basically the edge that

448
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
we've got here is too hard so we can

449
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,559
smooth out that edge by using mask

450
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,960
smooth mask okay now if we use the

451
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,880
inflate just towards to the right a

452
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,760
little

453
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,480
bit I'm just going to go with that let's

454
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,840
go object mode and see how that

455
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,039
looks that's pretty good I might

456
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
actually go just a little bit more just

457
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,679
exaggerate it slightly

458
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
more there we go great so

459
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,400
yeah that's roughly it now there's a

460
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,280
little bit of artifacting there cuz the

461
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,080
the way the mask works is it's kind of

462
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,679
that Feathering thing it's not very

463
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,080
exact and it's kind of got some values

464
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,360
in between it so we can smooth that out

465
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
in sculp mode by first of all just

466
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,720
clearing the mask and then using the

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
smooth

468
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
tool um by default it's too high so just

469
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
turn it down and I'm just going to

470
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
smooth that edge and that'll just sort

471
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,559
of clear up some of this artifacting

472
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,760
it's a little too high for whatever

473
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,360
reason the smooth tool which also you

474
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,000
can access at any point when you're in

475
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,120
sculp mode just by holding down shift

476
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,840
and it'll temporarily uh invoke the

477
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,400
smooth tool and uh it'll use the value

478
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,240
that is on the smooth tool so you'll be

479
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,799
in this mode and then you hold down

480
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,679
shift and it'll actually not bring use

481
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,280
this value but the value that's on the

482
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,840
smooth tool um again zbrush is the

483
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,080
competitor so some things are a little

484
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,960
weird here anyways um so it's a little

485
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,679
too high just turn it down and now we've

486
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,200
got a nice value and I'm just smoothing

487
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,240
this out to just clear up some of the

488
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,760
artifacting all the

489
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,400
way

490
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,840
around the

491
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,600
mesh B boop

492
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,480
boop and that's it lovely hey if you've

493
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,960
made it this far 3D is in the carts it's

494
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
for you because uh we've done some

495
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,120
fairly complex things so if you're a

496
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,440
beginner and you're just getting started

497
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
in blender congrats um because it is a

498
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
steep learning curve but you have

499
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
learned some very complex modeling and

500
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,400
uh some sculpting so congrats you've

501
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
made it this far why not continue on the

502
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,200
series click here to see the next video

503
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
