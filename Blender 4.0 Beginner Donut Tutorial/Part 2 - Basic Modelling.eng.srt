1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,399
now we know how blender functions let's

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,520
start building that donut so as before

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,440
Let's uh well first of all just to

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,000
repeat make sure you are working with a

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
new scene completely new scene don't

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,120
want any remaining monkey heads lying

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,240
around let's begin fresh slate and let's

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,279
delete our default Cube just with the

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,160
delete key and let's replace it with a

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,519
new object you might remember the hot

11
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,480
key for that is shift a and as I

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,880
mentioned before you usually want what

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,400
is underneath mesh cuz these are your

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,560
Primitives

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
so we want to start with something that

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,120
most resembles what it is we're building

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,680
you if it was a house you might start

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,360
with a cube if it was a vase you might

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,719
start with a cylinder in our case we

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,399
want the donut shaped one although

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,200
mathematicians call it a Taurus for some

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,239
reason so let's add that now if I zoom

23
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,440
in by scrolling up we can see we have

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,559
something resembling a dut looks like a

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,640
pretty weak looking dut you know very

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,800
flimsy looks like the the doughnut

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,280
before it's cooked when they just drop

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,640
it into the vat and it's just this

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,199
little wispy thing um so immediately

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,799
after you do some actions in blender you

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,840
have options to change it and the

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,320
options are hidden down here in the

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,759
bottom left hand corner you see a little

34
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,119
box and if you click that box you see

35
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,479
options and look we can change the

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
dimensions of our Taurus now something

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
to note is that these options in blender

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,680
only appear immediately after you have

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,960
done that action if you do another

40
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,840
action like say deselect your Taurus by

41
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,680
mistake it's gone right because blender

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,720
has assumed you have moved on you've

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,600
accepted the state of your donut and

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,880
this is the one you want right now if

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
you haven't done anything drastic or

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
changed this object in some severe way

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,840
you can temporarily bring it back by

48
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,600
hitting F9 I never actually remember

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,640
that hotkey I just remember that

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,840
immediately after I have uh added an

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
object if I want to tweak it now's my

52
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
chance before I move on to something

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
else okay so we could change you know

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,000
the size of it here we can also change

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,039
the resolution I'll use the term

56
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,038
resolution Loosely um to uh to make it

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,959
higher or lower Fidelity and a mistake

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,280
that a lot of beginners make and I say

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,840
this because this was the exact mistake

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,200
I made way back in 2003 when I started

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
learning blender is they go well I need

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,080
a a realistic looking donut so I guess I

63
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,120
need to go really high resolution I

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
remember my first project one of my

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
first projects was for a high school

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
film project and I wanted to have a

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
closeup of a face didn't realize faces

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,239
were going to be difficult but I went

69
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,599
really high poly and then it was just an

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,840
absolute nightmare to work with so the

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
problem the reason you don't want this

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,480
is that for starters things that are

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,959
high poly are very slow to render and

74
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,400
they're very hard to work with if you

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,760
want to tweak the shape of it but also

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,599
as you learn and you grow with 3D you'll

77
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,280
discover that it is a lot easier to add

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,080
resolution to something later on but is

79
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,400
very difficult to take it away if you've

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,720
already built it into it and you don't

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
need it so long way to say what we

82
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,560
actually want is to have as few Poes

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,720
these are called poy uh as you can get

84
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,560
away with so I'm going to go with 32

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,000
major and 12 minor and don't worry that

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,879
it looks all Jagged because we will fix

87
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,680
that in a moment now the major and minor

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
this is really up to you but I find that

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
something that looks uh looks kind of

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,640
chunky like a fat donut just looks

91
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,239
really delicious so I'm going with

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,280
something

93
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,120
around about this size okay and once I'm

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,159
happy with this once I'm ready to click

95
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,560
off I click off the options are gone and

96
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,239
this is it this is the donut that I am

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
now working with so how do we make this

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,720
look higher resolution less Jagged well

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,400
one way is to use smooth shading so if

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
you rightclick with your object selected

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,799
go to shade

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
smooth and look at that this is

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,480
immediately better without getting too

104
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,720
technical this is kind of a fakery it's

105
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
sort of like the Shader is telling the

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,519
renderer that this is a really high poly

107
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,599
dense mesh when it really isn't it's

108
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,720
just basically kind of like averaging

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
out uh V uh faces and anyway it's very

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,959
technical but basically means it's not

111
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,239
going to add anything to your render

112
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,120
time but it's going to look smoother and

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
so this is generally what you want for

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,918
something that is smooth and and organic

115
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
looking like we want if you were

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
rendering like architectural or like

117
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
hard surfaces like later on we're going

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,639
to put this on a counter then the object

119
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,479
would obviously want to be flat but in

120
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,960
our case we're just going to use shade

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,759
smooth but you might notice that looking

122
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,080
at this especially if you go side on

123
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,680
that you've got this sort of uh Jagged

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
shape around here right so the

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
silhouette is really breaking that

126
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,919
illusion that this is a high poly or a

127
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,800
smooth looking donut but thankfully

128
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,360
rather than adding all of that complex

129
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
density into the mesh itself and then

130
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,080
making it hard to remove later on there

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,240
is another way through modifiers so if

132
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
we go over here to our properties right

133
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,840
this very confusing lots of option

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
looking properties click on the wrench

135
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,600
and this is the section called modifiers

136
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,840
and this is one of those uh object

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
dependent uh things so if you've got

138
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
your camera selected you won't see it so

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
it's only when you've got actual meshes

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
that you might see uh this uh this

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
modifier here so it's much easier to

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
explain if we just add one so up here

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,639
add modify and you got a range of

144
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,520
options here that can do a whole number

145
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,039
of things the one that we're looking for

146
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,759
is underneath generate and it is called

147
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,440
subdivision surface and it is a really

148
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,360
common modifier that you use all the

149
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
time in fact it's so common it's

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
actually you can just immediately add it

151
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
to any object just by hitting control

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,479
one but don't do that cuz we've already

153
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,199
got it so there now some of you might

154
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,160
have just discovered that your donut has

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,319
disappeared if that is the case you need

156
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,440
to go to edit preferences and then

157
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
underneath viewport where it's got

158
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,600
subdivision at the very bottom disable

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,039
GPU subdivision that will then make the

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
subdivision perform on your CPU instead

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,039
instead of your GPU which is maybe

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
nonexistent or not performing whatever

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
um but disable that and it should appear

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,639
but if it's already working for you

165
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,319
don't disable it keep it going cuz GPU

166
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,840
will be faster so what exactly is this

167
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
doing well it's a lot easier to explain

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
if we look at the shade flat mode

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
because we're not being uh tricked by

170
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
the the smooth shading there um if I set

171
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,360
this levels viewport to zero this is our

172
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
original mesh this is before we add the

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
subsurface essentially when we increase

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,360
this you can see that it is adding

175
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,960
resolution to our mesh and the more I

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240
increase this viewport levels here uh

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,840
the finer and finer that detail becomes

178
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,720
so to explain it because this is such a

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
very very common uh modifier it's kind

180
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,000
of important to understand how it's

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,440
working you can see that uh this is uh

182
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,000
these squares here these are called

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Faces by the way and and for each one of

184
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,879
these faces here as I add a level you

185
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,879
can see it's becoming four faces right

186
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,720
and then now if I zoomed in on this one

187
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,120
one face here if I do another level

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,199
that's now become four faces and then if

189
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,199
I zoom in again it's now become four

190
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,960
faces so it's exponentially adding

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,639
detail and you might also know that it

192
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,520
is smoothing it out as well like this

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Jagged Edge that we've got here you can

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,879
see now becomes smoother so to quickly

195
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,800
visualize that if I just draw like

196
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,280
imagine you've got like a 90 Dee uh

197
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
corner right like this if you add a Subs

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,120
surf modifier what it's going to do is

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,240
it's going to add uh a point here right

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,000
because this is uh the extra detail it's

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,479
also going to take that point there and

202
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,440
it's going to average it out it's going

203
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,280
to average it out between these points

204
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,240
and it's going to create another one

205
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
there and another one there so you go

206
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,639
then from having that really hard corner

207
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,000
there to having something that looks a

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,560
lot smoother so it's going to take a

209
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,479
point and it's also going to uh change

210
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,680
it to make it look smoother gener

211
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,520
speaking so there we go um so now as I

212
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,039
increase this you can see it's getting

213
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,000
uh smoother and smoother now the reason

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
there are two options here you've got

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,960
levels viewport and levels render so

216
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,120
reminder this gray area that we operate

217
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,720
in is called our viewport the render is

218
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,879
the pretty version so as an example um

219
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,120
you could see if I just turned it off

220
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,759
for the viewboard it looks very Jagged

221
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,400
but then for my render if I increase

222
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,479
that to three if I do my render which

223
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,319
you could go up there F uh and render

224
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,680
image or remember the hotkey F12 you can

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
see that that donut is now smooth but I

226
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
go back and you can see it's Jagged so

227
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,240
the viewport you want to generally keep

228
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
it lightweight and then the render time

229
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,399
that's where you want to get uh a really

230
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,399
nice looking pretty image so you want to

231
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,958
often have two different levels um in

232
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,959
our case though I don't really think we

233
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,600
need to go beyond one even for our final

234
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,959
pretty image um because this with uh

235
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,880
shade smoothing turned on is good enough

236
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,160
and we're going to be adding more to the

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,279
scene later on so we don't want to make

238
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,120
it too complex so this is actually

239
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,680
pretty good okay so we have a perfect

240
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,839
dut and that's the problem it's too

241
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,600
perfect you could spend decades trying

242
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,519
to develop a machine in the real world

243
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,519
that make it that made a donut this

244
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,240
perfect and you never would this is so

245
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,000
mathematically precise that the eye will

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,839
always see this as looking fake so

247
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,200
that's actually a problem you learn

248
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,320
pretty quickly in 3D that things that

249
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,440
are too perfect just look fake so you

250
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
have to spend time making things look

251
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,279
misshapen and adding variation there

252
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,760
like you see in the real world because

253
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,560
your eye expects to see it so how do we

254
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
do that how do we make this doughnut

255
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,160
look a little more lumpy and interesting

256
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,640
I do that by changing the mesh itself so

257
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,360
this mode that we are in right now where

258
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,720
we can uh you know click on different

259
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
objects is called object mode and I know

260
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
that because in the top leftand corner

261
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
you can see we are in object mode but if

262
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
I click the drop down you can see I get

263
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,079
a number of other options options here

264
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,800
and these options again will change

265
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,560
depending on the object you've got

266
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,360
selected if I've got a lamp my little

267
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,160
light there selected you can see I've

268
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,480
only got object mode my camera I've only

269
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,240
got object mode but a mesh will give you

270
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
extra options here so let's enter into

271
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
edit mode

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
ooh right now you can see our mesh our

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,320
sorry our object has become something

274
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,959
that looks weird it's got a bunch of uh

275
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
little points on it with lines and very

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,279
technical well that's because this is

277
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,399
actually what the mesh is made up of

278
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
these little points here which you can

279
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,959
click on just by selecting are called

280
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,120
your vertices the singular term is

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,720
called vertex I never say that I like to

282
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,760
just call all of them vertices

283
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,560
regardless of whether it's one or two

284
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,399
just because you always get some

285
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,360
comments that go um actually it's called

286
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,600
vertex if it is singular anyway so these

287
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,360
are called your vertices and if you have

288
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
two of them joined by a line that is

289
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,680
called an edge and if you have four of

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
them forming uh a face then it's called

291
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,000
a face so with these I can quickly

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
change the shape of my object by using

293
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,760
the same hot Keys as before and if I

294
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,200
want to move this then I would simply

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,120
tap G right and you can see it's now

296
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,000
attached to my cursor and then if I want

297
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,399
to confirm its movement I just do a

298
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,079
single left click and there it is now if

299
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,440
I go back into object

300
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,519
mode like that you can see that my mesh

301
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,839
has changed okay and by the way the hot

302
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,160
key for jumping in and out of object and

303
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,920
edit mode is Just Tab okay so you can

304
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
see it's just toggling between those two

305
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,279
modes because it's so common that you

306
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,120
want to just quickly change things that

307
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,839
it's just uh easily accessible by that

308
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,639
now this is okay right but you can see

309
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,760
it's like it's got like some artifacting

310
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
it's like it's not the greatest lump

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,720
right so how do we make it look a little

312
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
more uh natural well I mean you could

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,320
you know you move one drag it out Okay

314
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
click and then I move oh the next one

315
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,480
next to it right I'll move that out and

316
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,639
then I'll move this one out a little bit

317
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,480
and then and then I move this one it's

318
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
like okay well now I've got the thing

319
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,079
but it took me like five action

320
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,320
ridiculous right no one wants to do that

321
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,800
no one's got time for that thankfully

322
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,160
there is a tool in blunder uh just for

323
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,880
this and it's called proportional

324
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,000
editing and you can enable it up there

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in your toolbar so if you enable that

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,279
now if I hit G and I move it out you

327
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,480
will see I get a little ring around my

328
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,240
cursor there and that is now changing uh

329
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,560
the mesh around it now a lot of people

330
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,880
in my previous tutorials were like I

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,760
don't see what's what's going on you

332
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,680
have to have something selected first

333
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,880
and then when you hit G you will see uh

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,720
that uh that little circle of influence

335
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,000
okay now this circle of influence if I

336
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,240
scroll down sorry if I scroll up you can

337
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,279
see it's shrinking its circle of

338
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,399
influence and if I scroll down it is

339
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,360
expanding its influence so it's only

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,279
going to affect what is in that uh that

341
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,440
ring there okay if you are on uh yeah if

342
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,160
you don't have a mouse with a scroll

343
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,040
wheel you can also change the influence

344
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,639
by using page up and page down and if

345
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,399
you don't have page up or page down

346
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,120
because you're on a Mac keyboard then

347
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,199
what you would have to do is go to

348
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,639
keymap and then change your page up and

349
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,920
page down to something else just so that

350
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,959
you could get around that but guys you

351
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,440
got to get a mouse get a mouse with a

352
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,279
scroll wheel I think they're I don't

353
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,240
know 50 cents or just in the nearest

354
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,600
landfill somewhere get a mouse cuz it's

355
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
going to make uh your life in 3D a lot

356
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
easier okay so with this I can now uh

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
make quick work of uh of lumpy shapes

358
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,680
okay so I just drag that out okay I've

359
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,320
got a little lumpy shape there maybe I

360
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,320
go down here and I pull this up just by

361
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,920
hitting G moving it up okay so already

362
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,440
this is looking a little more natural

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,800
right cuz even if we were making a

364
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,320
stylized world for a Pixar movie or

365
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,519
something like that you can't have just

366
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,160
a a spherical looking donut sorry

367
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,040
spherical round looking circular

368
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
doughnut cuz it just your eye will see

369
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,480
it as fake so very quickly I'm able to

370
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
add a little bit of variation to the dut

371
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,680
um just all around it just a little bit

372
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,399
over here and you can see that I am uh

373
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,519
just changing my circle of influence

374
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,279
depending on what size of a a lump I

375
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,639
want to make so if I just want to make

376
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,000
like a little bit that sticks out I can

377
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,759
make a small Circle just by scrolling up

378
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,519
like that um and you just want to do

379
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,600
that until you get something that

380
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,279
looks a little more natural I might want

381
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
to make the the inner part as well maybe

382
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,959
just drag that in with a smaller

383
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,279
Circle and that's pretty good let's just

384
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,680
have a look from the top I might

385
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,079
actually just drag that out make it a

386
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,199
little bit more like

387
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,720
that but there you go that's pretty good

388
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,240
for a donut it's still kind of simple

389
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
it's not too detailed um but it's got

390
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,759
just enough variation in it that uh it's

391
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,800
more interesting to look at oh one more

392
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,839
thing forgot to mention go back into

393
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
edit mode with tab um Donuts when

394
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,160
they're sitting in the uh little vat

395
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,519
thing right uh they're only like half

396
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,759
submerged then they have to be flipped

397
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,560
uh but it means that the bit that's

398
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
nearest to the surface is getting less

399
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,680
heat so essentially what I'm saying is

400
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,639
the bit that's around the the dut the

401
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,000
the circumference of it is usually a

402
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,839
little bit flatter so Donuts aren't like

403
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,920
perfectly round all the way around they

404
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,560
usually a little bit flatter so what I

405
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
want to do is I want to select these

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,279
vertices along here and then I want to

407
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,480
shrink them now I could go around one by

408
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,160
one like this which is actually what I

409
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,880
used to do when I was uh learning

410
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,600
blender pre YouTube days and there was

411
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,959
uh no tutorials what I would I would do

412
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,560
this if I wanted to select this silly

413
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,759
because there's a a a function a tool

414
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,000
for that and it is Edge select so if you

415
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,959
hold down alt on your keyboard board and

416
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,920
then do a single left click on not the

417
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
points but on the edge right this little

418
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
line here you can see it's selected all

419
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,920
the way around so it's anything that's

420
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,199
connected along that line is now

421
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,319
selected so if I want to shrink this

422
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:16,639
right what would I do well I mean yeah

423
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
you could like move it around right we

424
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,800
want to shrink it we want to change the

425
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,680
scale of it so we would change we would

426
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,839
use the hotkey S for scale so s and I'm

427
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,360
going to scale that in and I actually

428
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
don't want proportional editor so I'm

429
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,759
going to turn that off and now scale in

430
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
and just make it a little bit flatter

431
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,959
and there you go see just feels a little

432
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,800
bit more natural doesn't it looks a

433
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,839
little bit closer to what a donut looks

434
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
like and by the way don't worry if yours

435
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
doesn't look exactly like this like your

436
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,680
lump is a little bit off like some

437
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
people get a little bit too precious

438
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
with the G I got to match exactly

439
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,959
everything I do like I'm just working on

440
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,079
the fly as well so just make what you

441
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
think looks good maybe you think this is

442
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
not misshapen enough and you want to add

443
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,279
more go for it because it might actually

444
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,240
turn turn out better than what mine is

445
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,319
now before we move to the next part um

446
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,640
how to save how to save blender very

447
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,359
very easy you just go save as and you

448
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,919
just get one file it's called dot blend

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,199
um very literal file extension really

450
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,559
pushing the limits of what a file

451
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,919
extension can be that's almost a word

452
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,319
blender anyway um dot blend and that's

453
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
it and then next time you open it up

454
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,079
it's exactly like it it's not like

455
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,199
zbrush where you got like four or five

456
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,240
different ways to save a project or an

457
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,640
object or a tool

458
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,480
hate zbrush okay um that's how you save

459
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,559
now also finally I will say uh if you

460
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,520
need help because I know if you if

461
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
you're stuck and then you leave a a

462
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,919
YouTube comment you might not get a

463
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,039
reply uh if you want immediate help I've

464
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,400
got a Discord so I'll put the link uh

465
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,960
below so there's like a little channel

466
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,440
in there where you can just ask for

467
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,799
specific uh donut help so if you're

468
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,120
having issues uh feel free to jump into

469
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
that and also guys don't beat yourself

470
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,360
up like 3D is definitely a uh has like a

471
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
steepish learning curve so you're in

472
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,200
that that steep slope right now and it's

473
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
it's really common like a lot of this

474
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
stuff is very foreign 3D is very unique

475
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
it's very different to a lot of 2D tools

476
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
um but don't give up like it's it's

477
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,440
definitely achievable to learn and

478
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,080
self-learn at home you don't have to go

479
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,640
to school you don't have to pay for a

480
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,760
tutor um it's really easy to uh to get

481
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,320
help online nowadays so do make use of

482
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,440
that Discord um post uh comments as well

483
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,520
in the YouTube comment if you want to um

484
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,440
but I hope hope you stay with it so if

485
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,080
you're ready to jump to the next part

486
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
after you've saved your blend file go

487
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,720
ahead click here and I will see you

488
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,600
