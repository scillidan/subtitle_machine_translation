1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,520
this is the part where we start making

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,480
our Donuts look sexy so uh we're going

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,080
to be coloring our sprinkles finally so

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,559
it doesn't look so depressing um and

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,440
then also getting into rendering to

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,880
start making this actually look pleasing

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,519
with Shadows and Light and everything

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,760
else so first of all the sprinkles now

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,480
as you probably know you could come in

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,279
here and you could select a Sprinkle and

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,400
then go all right I'm going to make a a

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,199
red sprinkle and then I'm going to don't

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,920
do this by the way I'm just showing you

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
uh make this uh Aqua sprinkle

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
and then a blue sprinkle right and this

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
does work does exactly what you would

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
expect the problem with this though is

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
that for one the color is locked to that

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
specific sprinkle so this curved

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,559
sprinkle is always red okay and the

21
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,239
short sprinkle is always white the other

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,600
issue is that this is not easy to change

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,480
the distribution of those colors like if

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,399
I'm an artist I'm looking this I'm like

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
that's kind of boring because all the

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,559
colors is like 25% blue 25% white 25 you

27
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,960
know I want to have maybe 80% One uh

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,920
dominant color and then a few splashes

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,080
of complimentary colors I can't do that

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,400
so there is a much much easier way um so

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
first let me just clear all of these and

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm going to create one new material I'm

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,040
going to call it sprinkles and I'll

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
actually show you how to quickly apply

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
uh the same material to multiple objects

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,079
at the same time um because we haven't

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,640
done that yet so let me I'm going to

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,479
grab my round sprinkle which is

39
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,399
currently still over there by itself

40
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,759
I'll just bring it over here so it's

41
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,079
part of the family there we go all right

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,439
so I've got uh I've got one object with

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,640
the the material that I want to apply

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,840
them all to uh what I need to do is

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,759
shift select all the objects that I want

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,079
to have that material and then lastly

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,920
shift select again the object that has

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,479
the material I want to apply them to and

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
then and you know that cuz it's it's uh

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,320
highlighted yellow okay then hit contrl

51
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,000
l this brings up the link or transfer

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,399
menu and we want to link the

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,520
materials and now you can see our

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,479
material has a five next to it because

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,680
five material sorry five objects are

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,120
sharing this material and that's it and

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,560
now obviously because they're linked it

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,599
means if I make a change over here um

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,959
they're all going to be reflected great

60
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,360
now we're going to do something fancy so

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
let's go to the shading tab which gives

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,080
us access to our uh nodes oh dear where

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
have I all right let's go back trying to

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
get to that sprinkle okay to our uh

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,959
notes now I want to introduce you to a

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,400
little friend called shift a input the

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
object info node a very weird little uh

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,440
weird little node that just does some

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,480
useful things when you might need it so

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,640
you see it pop up in a few tutorials um

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
there's a bunch of stuff here that it

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,360
can do the most useful one for us in

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,599
this instance is the random input drop

74
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,319
that into your base color and let's see

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
what happens so we've got some gray

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
values and it's easier to see actually

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
when you look at the donuts so what this

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,280
has done is it has assigned a value a

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,519
random value for each individual

80
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,599
sprinkle between zero and one so because

81
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,480
that's then being transferred to color

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,120
information it means that for example

83
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,480
this sprinkle might have got a value of

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,560
like

85
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,120
0.0 2 3 right the robot spat that out uh

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
and then this one this white is look one

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,760
maybe this was

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,959
0.89 or something like that okay so it's

89
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,080
just transferred those values into color

90
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,200
information which is just blacks to

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,680
whites not very useful right now but we

92
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,599
can use that those those numbers in a

93
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,200
I'll just show you okay shift a we're

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,640
going to go converter color ramp

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,439
probably I mean I might have used this

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
node more than any other node in blender

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,079
before it's like so versatile used for

98
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,040
so many things so drop it in here

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,239
between the object info and the

100
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,239
principled and uh currently it is

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
exactly the same because it's just the

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
it's transferring that data into a

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,319
gradient value of the exact same Shades

104
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,640
but we can change

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,680
this to any color that we want and look

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,600
at that so you can very quickly see this

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,519
is exactly how we're going to create

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,000
sprinkles of different colors um now one

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
thing you'll note looking at this is

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
that every single sprinkle is a

111
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,680
different shade like no two sprinkles

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,320
have the same color right now because

113
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,840
this is a gradient and that's not how it

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
works in the real world because the

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,160
sprinkles come out of you know one

116
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
constant icing bag right or a machine

117
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,840
with the same food di so basically all

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,680
the blue ones would have the exact shade

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,039
of blue and all the orange ones would

120
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,039
have the exact shade orange so we need

121
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,600
to change this from linear to constant

122
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,120
and now if I slide this across look at

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
that we are influencing what percentage

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,840
now is orange or blue and this is really

125
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,320
cool cuz it means you get to work like

126
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,400
an artist and just create a really nice

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,080
appealing looking donut very very

128
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,840
quickly so I'm going to go with like a

129
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
light blue over here and then I'm going

130
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,320
to create a new color just by hitting

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
the plus button and then let's give this

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,319
a purple like that and I'll make this

133
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,039
one pink actually same shade as our dut

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
why not you'll note by the way that I'm

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
not going like full saturation um and

136
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,160
that's deliberate because you learn in

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,319
our that yeah like saturation and color

138
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,199
is quite uh aggressive it's quite noisy

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,199
and uh quite attention grabbing and so

140
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,400
if you use too much of it it can be

141
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,039
exhausting so I I tend to keep it at

142
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,720
like

143
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,039
08 um okay and then I'll also go over

144
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,840
here and I'm going to make this white

145
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,680
let's go oh whoop no not like that white

146
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,919
and I'm going to create another one next

147
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,720
to it and this one I'm going to make

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
yellow okay so just by sliding this

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,400
around I could say like less white more

150
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,240
yellow less yellow more white and then I

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,400
can go yeah more blue it's just a really

152
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,160
simple easy way to create the exact um

153
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
the exact look you're going for awesome

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
now something uh you don't have to do

155
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,280
this next part but it's so easy why not

156
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,560
I was looking on a Pinterest on like uh

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
like aesthetically pleasing Donuts like

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
trying to make this uh look really cool

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
and uh and I saw like metallic sprinkles

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,840
and I was like hm that's an interesting

161
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,759
idea what if I made these white and

162
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,800
yellow ones metallic and then they would

163
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,360
look silver and gold so there is a

164
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,560
slider in your principled bsdf technical

165
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
name that just means it's the Shader

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
that does everything um and it's the

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,039
metallic Shader look at that so if I

168
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,880
slide this all the way to one all my

169
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,440
sprinkles are now metallic and if I

170
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
slide all the way to zero then they are

171
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,800
non-metallic and that's actually how you

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
should use this slider all materials in

173
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
the real world are either uh

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
non-metallic also known as dialectric

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
materials so that would be most of the

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
sprinkles um and then some objects are

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
metallic entirely metallic um there are

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
technically a few rare materials on

179
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,240
Earth that have some blend between it

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,520
but as a rule you should not have a

181
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,360
value that is between zero and one it

182
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
should be either zero or one anyways so

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,080
what we can do with this because we've

184
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,120
got this color ramp information here is

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
I can actually uh just convert like I

186
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,000
can make a color ramp that is just black

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,280
and white that just shows which sprinkle

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
is metallic and which one isn't so um if

189
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,759
I duplicate this and here's a pro tip if

190
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,840
you use control shift d it will

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
duplicate it but it will retain its

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
connection so just saves you I don't

193
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,280
know one second uh and now I'm going to

194
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,120
connect that into my metallic input now

195
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,840
currently this is wrong because this

196
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,120
information is uh it's just using yeah

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,639
it's like color so we need to be black

198
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
and white so this one here because this

199
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,080
is going to represent my dialectric

200
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
colors I'm going to set this to Black so

201
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,520
it is non-metal and then this I can

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
delete and this I can delete because

203
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
because on the left hand side of it it's

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,400
all black sorry so it's all uh

205
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,240
non-metals and then over here these two

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
the uh the silver and the gold they're

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
going to be metal so actually I can

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
delete the gold and now that's doing

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
exactly what it should so we've now got

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
dialectric non-metals and metals and the

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,560
reason it doesn't look like metal by the

212
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,800
way is cuz your roughness is here so if

213
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,080
you set it all the way down you can see

214
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,319
it starts to look a lot closer to a

215
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,560
metallic

216
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,680
sprinkle um and by the way you can get

217
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,960
the exact like position you can go like

218
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,479
7 and then here 7 type it in and then

219
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,799
that way it's definitely uh correct for

220
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,760
whatever reason of mine this has to be a

221
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
bug there's something weird about it but

222
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,200
there's one sprinkle on my Donuts

223
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,480
probably not on yours but it's like it's

224
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,680
it's it's purple up here but then it

225
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,880
crept over into the metallic category

226
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,200
down here which shouldn't be possible

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,040
but evidently it's just on my I've never

228
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,760
seen it before but one of them has

229
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
actually snuck over doesn't matter it's

230
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,320
a what it it can be the rare purple uh

231
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,640
metallic One um all right but I don't

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
want the uh these other ones to be uh

233
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,279
shiny at least that shiny so I'm going

234
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,519
to again duplicate this control shift d

235
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,399
and with this if I plug this into my

236
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
roughness input just like before these

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,920
black and white values will decide what

238
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
is the roughness of the metallic and non

239
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,560
non-metallics so this one here um I want

240
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,800
this to be essentially the opposite of

241
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,399
what it is almost entirely black a

242
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
little bit so that there's a little bit

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
of roughness to it like that and then

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,240
this one over here I want this to be a

245
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,480
lot more diffuse not entirely diffuse

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,120
like somewhat of a blend cuz if you look

247
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,200
at reference which you should be

248
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,279
modeling off reference there is uh some

249
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,560
shininess to them so yeah but that is it

250
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,680
so you can see very quickly we have

251
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
created some very aesthetically pleasing

252
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
donuts and have fun with it guys like

253
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,560
create a cool looking donut um you can

254
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,279
use whatever color combinations you you

255
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,040
want I really do like it when people

256
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,839
experiment and not just follow a

257
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,160
tutorial down to a tea but like venture

258
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
out there and you know do do interesting

259
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
things so try different color

260
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,079
combinations try different icing colors

261
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,279
um and you could make something that

262
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,240
looks uh looks really cool but that's

263
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,519
almost it for our donut it's pretty well

264
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,519
done which means we can now finally talk

265
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,959
about rendering so as a recap of uh of

266
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
part one if you hit F12 that's going to

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,560
put you into the rendered state our

268
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,519
camera is really far away from the donut

269
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,320
so actually let's first fix that if you

270
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
go to your camera view you just by

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
clicking that little icon there or by

272
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,320
hitting number pad uh zero that'll take

273
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,360
you there as well um this is the camera

274
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,680
view we're really far away I mentioned

275
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,279
in the start that uh if you use uh this

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,680
key this button view lock camera to view

277
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,240
that'll let you like grab it and move it

278
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,800
around but it is actually another way I

279
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,079
didn't want to introduce you to too many

280
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,000
uh keyboard shortcuts at the start but

281
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,480
if you hit with the camera selected

282
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,880
shift Tilla key that will put you in fly

283
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
mode uh the other way to do that by the

284
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,519
way is to just go uh view navigation fly

285
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,639
navigation there if you don't have that

286
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,240
key so anyway in this mode it's now it's

287
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,639
almost like you're playing a video game

288
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,200
so like it's just I'm playing a

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,639
first-person shooter looking around my

290
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,160
scene w is move forward just like in a

291
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,240
video game uh a is strafe left D is

292
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,440
strafe right and S is back so w ASD just

293
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,000
like a video game um I can also go up by

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,680
hitting e and then down by hitting q and

295
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
if it's too sensitive like if the

296
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,120
movement is like you know crazy fast uh

297
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,160
the scroll wheel also decides how uh far

298
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,399
oh goodness there it is okay how fast

299
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,040
the movement is so scroll down if it's

300
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,480
going too quickly for you um but yeah I

301
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,079
can now place place the camera wherever

302
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,560
it is I want and then when it's there I

303
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
just click single left click and now

304
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
it's there and by the way that mode is H

305
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
called fly navigation and it works also

306
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
not just from the camera view but

307
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,880
anywhere in blender if you ever want to

308
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,560
just like you know move around you can

309
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,240
do uh use that fly mode so shift tilter

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,320
key for that all right so we do a render

311
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,720
we get something that looks hideous why

312
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,360
is that well for starters it's not a

313
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,000
very the scene has just got one light in

314
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,120
it but the primary reason and by the way

315
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,279
uh the yes that's the render View mode

316
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,240
but also if you go to rendered view

317
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
shading up there this is the exact

318
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
replica of that but just in the viewport

319
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
okay

320
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
now the primary reason this looks bad is

321
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
because of the renderer okay so

322
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
blender's default render engine if you

323
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,920
go to your render properties is called

324
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,360
EV now EV is fast but it is not accurate

325
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,199
if you are familiar with games most of

326
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,800
you probably are um EV is basically a

327
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,639
game engine so it's designed to be

328
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,440
really fast probably not 60 frames per

329
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
second but really really fast um and

330
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,160
it's a in terms of uh the renderer types

331
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,480
there's usually actually you call them

332
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,920
like real time is what this type is and

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,760
that is a rasterized uh render engine

334
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,279
and then you have Ray Tred or path

335
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,120
traced engine sometimes called offline

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,720
renderers um which are a lot more

337
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,839
accurate but much slower so this is good

338
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,720
if you don't really care about realism

339
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,279
uh like maybe you're making a title

340
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,560
effect for a TV you know thing or

341
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
whatever or you're on a really tight

342
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,560
deadline you just want to get something

343
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
out fast you can use EV um now you can

344
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
make it look better than what we have

345
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,399
like for example I think the because

346
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,279
we're using like really small sizes for

347
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,240
our donut you want to increase your Cube

348
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,920
size and then your lamp the bias there

349
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
you go you set that all the way to zero

350
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,920
um and now it's more appropriate for

351
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,160
this size we've got Shadows but it's

352
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,360
still not great um we don't for example

353
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,279
have shadows on any of our sprinkles um

354
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,480
because it's just too fine a detail and

355
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,040
the shadow itself it's just like a

356
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,759
blurry mess so this is it's just a

357
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,920
fakery um and it's just like what's

358
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,040
going on uh with with video games I will

359
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,759
briefly mention also that blunder 4.1

360
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,040
which is what this is here it's in Alpha

361
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
State at the time of this recording I've

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,560
been using 4.0 for the this whole

363
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,279
recording but this is 4.1 and it is a

364
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,920
it's EV but it's completely Rewritten

365
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
and it is better right so the Shadows

366
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,639
are better um there is actually even

367
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,279
some bounce lighting happening but it's

368
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,440
kind of like a fake bounce lighting and

369
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,720
it's definitely better but it's still

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
not

371
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,199
great so that is the limitation it's

372
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,199
fast but it is not great um and that's

373
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,959
what you get with rasterized real time

374
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,000
um engines so there is another render

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
engine to go to your render engine

376
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
settings and click the drop down ignore

377
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
workbench that's for like um just like

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
basically rendering your viewport really

379
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,440
for technical stuff um Cycles so those

380
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,759
are the two main engines of of blender

381
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,000
you got cycles and you've got EV Cycles

382
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,759
is uh what's known as an offline

383
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,959
renderer or a path trade also known as

384
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,880
Ray traced engine now uh this looks way

385
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,320
better than what we had before you'll

386
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,600
notice for example that all of our

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
sprinkles have shadows by the way

388
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,920
apologies if my recording gets a little

389
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
choppy it's because it's uh using the

390
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,279
CPU anyway um you can see it's uh it's

391
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,600
got proper Shadows on things uh there's

392
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,519
actually bounce lighting right that's

393
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,199
like coming off this uh this table here

394
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,639
and it's going underneath the dut um so

395
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,880
it's like it's shooting around inside

396
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,240
here and it's shooting back and it's

397
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,399
going over here which is exactly what

398
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,639
happens in the real world and it's

399
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
really important for realism to get that

400
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
uh bounce I mean any room any

401
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,319
architecture you basically have to use

402
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,160
Cycles um to do it because uh that's how

403
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,319
you get proper lighting like in the real

404
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,040
world but you get all this for free at

405
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,319
the cost of speed so you'll notice as I

406
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,399
move around whilst my recording goes

407
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,120
choppy that it's starts grainy and then

408
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,240
it kind of refines itself and if you

409
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
look in the top leftand Corner you've

410
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,759
got something that says says samples so

411
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,160
uh as you leave it uh rendering longer

412
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,519
it's rendering more samples essentially

413
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,360
it's just like the computer's just

414
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
chewing through it that's I mean it

415
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,399
there's technical ways to explain it but

416
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,319
that's the simplest way to think of it

417
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,399
and it'll get clearer as uh the longer

418
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,160
you leave it now there is actually two

419
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
ways to calculate this one is to use

420
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,519
your CPU which is what it's on by

421
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,399
default another is to use your GPU which

422
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,360
is grade out by default so let's fix

423
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,120
that go to edit preferences and then go

424
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,880
to system and you can see at the top

425
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,000
there Cycles Render devices so try

426
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
switching to one of these tabs and see

427
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,600
what you get if you have a device like

428
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,920
myself uh that is a GPU that is

429
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,240
supported um then you can render on that

430
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,120
and it'll be way faster so just as an

431
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,279
FYI Cuda is NVIDIA and it's for like

432
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,360
cards like I think 1080 backwards so

433
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,079
like 90s 800s I think they used CA

434
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,720
Optics was around uh the 2,000 series um

435
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,359
further on so Optics is the one that you

436
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,640
use if you're using a ninia card today

437
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,799
uh hip is for AMD cards and then you got

438
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,319
one API and I think actually on Apple

439
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,000
devices you'll have a metal option but

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
see what you have and then see if you

441
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,039
can render with that because that with

442
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,160
GPU on now it'll uh go back to this it

443
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
might actually the first time you use

444
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
your GPU it will say I think at the top

445
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
leftand corner um doing this for the

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,280
first time it'll do some pass it'll be

447
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,160
really slow it might take like 2 minutes

448
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,480
but then after you've done that every

449
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
time you open blender you should never

450
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,679
need to do it again so it might be slow

451
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,640
the first time you activate it but it'll

452
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
um it should be faster now this is way

453
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,360
faster than what we had before like you

454
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,640
can see how quickly it's uh it's

455
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,840
clearing through those samples um it's

456
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,960
basically real time um it's uh in fact

457
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,720
actually so that noise that I mentioned

458
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,760
right it's still there but when you

459
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,400
render and also in your viewport you can

460
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,000
use a denoiser so it's uh it's actually

461
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,120
not that new it's like 3 four years old

462
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,880
I think we started using Aid noises um

463
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,440
Nvidia released their one for Optics um

464
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,039
and since then Intel have come out with

465
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,360
one and it basically takes that noisy

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,000
image it uses some of the information

467
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,559
from the 3D renderer to clear it out

468
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,640
whilst preserving the detail so if you

469
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,280
can actually turn it on in the viewport

470
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,799
by hitting the dno one if you've got a

471
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,919
Nvidia card it'll be way better if you

472
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,520
don't it'll have to use the Intel

473
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
denoiser which is a lot slower um but

474
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
you can see the noise is practically

475
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,520
gone right so this is almost real time

476
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,559
um which is really really cool now

477
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,600
obviously not all of you are as lucky

478
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,880
right I've got four

479
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,799
309s um I started though on a Pentium 3

480
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,720
I think back in 2003 um and I mean look

481
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,880
they made a Toy Story on computers that

482
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,360
you couldn't even sell today cuz they

483
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
would be just garbage maybe you could

484
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,440
for like nostalgic anyways the point is

485
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,760
is that everybody when they start 3D is

486
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,159
using a device which is crappy don't let

487
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,600
it limit you or don't think oh I can't

488
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,480
use 3D until I get a better

489
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,799
computer a graphics card is definitely

490
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,760
one of the best investments you can make

491
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,640
if you're thinking like I want to do

492
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,280
this as a career this is definitely for

493
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,320
me I'm really enjoying this um it's

494
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,200
definitely a good investment because you

495
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
will be able to uh produce more renders

496
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
throughout the day faster um but it is

497
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,720
not essential you can get by with just a

498
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,640
CPU it just means that when you do your

499
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,799
render your final render instead of it

500
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,039
being you know done in an hour you might

501
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,200
have to leave it overnight um in the

502
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,240
past when I started with blender I was

503
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
making crappy renders at like 600 by 400

504
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,000
resolution and I was rendering for over

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
a week just to do a really crappy basic

506
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,640
animation so don't let it hinder you

507
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
it's it's totally normal that you'll

508
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,960
have a bad computer um if it's for you

509
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,039
in the future definitely worth investing

510
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,320
in in um in a card that is fast also if

511
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,360
you want to know which card to buy uh

512
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
blender actually put together an open

513
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
Benchmark uh so if you go to open dat.

514
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
blender.org or click the link in the

515
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,520
description you can see it's showing you

516
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,159
all of the the people that have done

517
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,480
this Benchmark what have their devices

518
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
been and what are the times that you can

519
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
expect so you can see as see mine is at

520
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,679
the bottom it's the uh 3090 uh but it's

521
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,919
I've got four of them so it's it's

522
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,640
obviously turning through it faster the

523
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,760
fastest is I mean basically it's going

524
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
to be the top card or like the go-to

525
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Nvidia is just crushing it um I think uh

526
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
where is the AMD they used to be on I

527
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,679
think AMD is made a made a mention there

528
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
you've also got CPUs on this side but

529
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
essentially I mean just by the top like

530
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
gaming card usually that's the one um

531
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,720
but do go here check it out if you want

532
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,640
all right so we're going to be using

533
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,679
cycles for the rest of this tutorial um

534
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,240
and we'll really dive into it in the

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
next part but I just want to quickly um

536
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,960
my lamp is way way away so let's just

537
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
bring that in closer just so that we can

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
see things and you can actually clear

539
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
the rotation of an object to make it

540
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,679
appear at the the center of your 3D

541
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,880
scene by tapping alt G okay so now hey

542
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
look that's actually kind of cool um I'm

543
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,440
going to move uh my lamp over to here

544
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,600
just check my recordings yeah my

545
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,000
recording is not being affected um and

546
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll just now reduce the strength of

547
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,360
this because it's obviously now way

548
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,080
closer but look at that like look at the

549
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,200
shadow that we get um coming off this

550
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
donut um it's like properly taped it's

551
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,880
not like some fakery so it's like tight

552
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
here and then it's like really uh faded

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,279
at the end there that kind of stuff is

554
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,880
really difficult to do with a um a a

555
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,520
rasterized realtime engine like EV uh

556
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,600
and you also get like all of this proper

557
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,919
like look at the Shadows on the

558
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,320
sprinkles the reflections is actually

559
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
true it's not like guessing and fakery

560
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
um yes it's a type of fakery but it's

561
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,360
it's much more accurate um anyways I I

562
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,200
like Cycles I'm I'm A Cycles guy um I

563
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
think most people actually are the first

564
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,880
version of Eevee was not that great

565
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
Eevee next in 4.1 might be better we'll

566
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
see uh but yeah the first version of

567
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,240
Eevee was not really that great now one

568
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,880
thing you might notice looking at your D

569
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
I'm going to make one one big tweak to

570
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,880
this is that it kind of feels hard like

571
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,440
doesn't give this kind of like soft

572
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,559
feeling to it and the reason for that is

573
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,200
the material so by default all materials

574
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,320
are yeah kind of like hard materials but

575
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,600
fleshy objects like humans as well as

576
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,799
food have subsurf for scattering so I'll

577
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,720
throw some reference photos here um but

578
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
you can see this is my hand I had uh

579
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,200
light coming in like as I was eating

580
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,039
breakfast and I can see the light is

581
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,080
actually going through my fingers right

582
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,279
so that's light that is uh like yeah

583
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,080
it's a mushy fleshy object so it's

584
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,760
passing through it scattering amongst

585
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,279
all the other atoms in the finger and

586
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,919
it's uh the light is going through to

587
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
the other side you also see it um in a

588
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
lot of food so took these photos at a

589
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,919
party yes I am that guy U but you can

590
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,760
see that's how you get light that goes

591
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,640
uh to the opposite sides uh my daughter

592
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
was eating a banana and uh I was like

593
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,120
look at that banana look at that

594
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,080
subsurface scattering right there so

595
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,640
donuts and icing have that and we can do

596
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
that we can add that sorry by going to

597
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,720
the materials and then down here you've

598
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,799
got subsurface okay so here uh the the

599
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,159
biggest one to turn it on and just like

600
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,400
metallic apparently this is uh by the

601
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,240
way a new setup for 4.0 but just like

602
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,960
metallic it's supposed to be a weight of

603
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,440
either zero or one all right now when

604
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,640
you do one it suddenly turned blue and

605
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,000
you're like what the hell happened there

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,400
that's because the radius this uh radius

607
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,799
is uh it's this is your XY Z but also

608
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,320
it's your RG and your B in this case and

609
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,120
these values are different because it's

610
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,679
designed for skin by default so this is

611
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,559
a great setup if you've got skin with

612
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,120
blood inside but we don't so click drag

613
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,919
down and then just set these values to

614
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,880
one all right so now it's closer to the

615
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,240
material still looks weird and that's

616
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
cuz the scale of this is wrong it's

617
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,760
saying that the thickness of the object

618
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,679
is 5 cm but this icing is not that so

619
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,840
let's make this

620
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,240
01 and now you can see it looks a lot

621
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,760
closer it's still a little dark so I

622
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,320
think it's uh it's not 1 cm thick so

623
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,039
let's go

624
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,640
0.5 and now we can see it's pretty close

625
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
to its original

626
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,799
material the biggest difference is if I

627
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,919
just zoom right in here let's set it to

628
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,039
what it was before see how it's hard it

629
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
almost feels like uh it just feels like

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
concrete right but then you set this to

631
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,000
one and look at that the the shadow just

632
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,960
starts to feel a little softer and you

633
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,159
get this bleed effect where kind of like

634
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,799
the shadow gets a like an edge to the

635
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,320
shadow where it gets a little more

636
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,159
saturated and Pinker um and that's Subs

637
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,480
surface scattering you don't have to

638
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
tell it how to do that it just does it

639
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
so you set the weight to one these to

640
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,120
one and then you just set your scale to

641
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,200
whatever it is you want um and I'm also

642
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,799
going to do it for my sprinkles so I'm

643
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,320
just going to click on one of my

644
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
sprinkles

645
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,039
and yeah right in here for the

646
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,559
subsurface I'll just do the same thing

647
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,039
set the weight as one these radiuses to

648
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,919
one and then I'll use a really low value

649
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,720
here like let's go

650
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,360
0

651
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,559
two and now you can see because these

652
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,919
sprinkles are yeah it's like icing right

653
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,840
it's just the exact same thing um yeah

654
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,000
we want some of the light to pass

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,880
through it and we don't actually have to

656
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
bother setting up that um that color

657
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
ramp system for the metal because Metals

658
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,640
automatically that Shader when you set

659
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
it to one it means it's going to cancel

660
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,080
any subsurface scattering that would

661
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
have appeared there so we don't have to

662
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,240
bother with it the subsurface is not

663
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,840
going to happen on Metals um but you can

664
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,159
see it starts to feel a lot softer a lot

665
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,399
um I don't know more pleasing more

666
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,240
delicious looking like real food because

667
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,640
that's really one of the telltale signs

668
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,480
of food is subsurface scattering awesome

669
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,159
so in the next part we're going to start

670
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,760
really building out the scene what I

671
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,080
want to do though at the end of this

672
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,760
video I want to give you some homework

673
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,159
and that is to try to model this plate

674
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,840
now we're going to do it actually in the

675
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,960
next part but it's simple enough and

676
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
it's actually possible to use all the

677
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,840
tools that I've mentioned in this uh

678
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,679
this series so far to model this

679
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,120
yourself now the reason I I'm trying to

680
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,679
give this as homework is that once this

681
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,679
tutorial finishes that's how it's going

682
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,159
to be you're going to have to try to

683
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,360
solve problems on the fly so it

684
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,919
definitely helps solidify learning if

685
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,880
you can try to apply it um by yourself

686
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,520
so have a go it doesn't matter if you

687
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,760
get stuck or you fail at it terribly

688
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,039
because you can just click the next part

689
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,000
and see how it's done but have a go at

690
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
it now um because then you'll start to

691
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
you you'll just retain the information a

692
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,880
lot better anyways go ahead click here

693
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
and uh and see how we build the rest of

694
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,039
the scene and build that plate
