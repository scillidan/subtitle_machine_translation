1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,399
did you guys know that blender 4.0 had a

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,839
change that makes it more realistic by

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,600
default or that there's a new technology

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,880
that is going to expand the uses for 3D

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
exponentially well you would if you were

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
on my free newsletter called this week

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
in 3D it's an email from me once a week

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,920
with three to five things that I found

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,600
interesting that week from the world of

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,160
3D so sometimes I share a new tool that

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,359
I found a remarkable tutorial a new

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,880
blender feature a new news story that

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,719
affects the industry so click the link

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,440
in the description enter your email

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,320
address and then you will stay up to

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,920
date on the world of 3D it's always free

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,399
and it's always written by me now on to

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,719
the tutorial welcome back to the donut

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,719
show where we make sad little Donuts

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,039
that we cannot eat this is where we

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,520
finished up at the end of part one we've

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
got our nice looking dut and now we're

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,800
going to make that icing which looks

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,160
complex but is actually fairly simple

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
now as I mentioned before if you want to

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
add an object you go shift a right and

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,399
then you start with something that

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,000
resembles what you're trying to create

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,479
but we already have something that

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,200
resembles the exact shape we want to

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,280
create it's the donut because we want

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,400
the icing around the donut so let's just

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,119
reuse this information so we can do that

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,920
by duplicating the object um and if you

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,040
don't know the hotkey for it you could

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,400
just go object and then you'd find it uh

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,040
here where it says shift d so shift d

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,479
now when you hit that you are in a

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
placement State essentially like it's

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,960
duplicated and it's now saying whereit

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
you want to place it now in our case and

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,040
actually often you don't actually want

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,360
to change its placement you want to

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,759
duplicate it exactly where it was so you

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
can cancel the movement by hitting

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Escape or right clicking now when you do

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
that it looks like it's canceled the

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
duplication but you can see in your

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,240
outliner it has duplicated it you've got

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,880
two objects but um it's just in the

51
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,280
exact same place which is what we want

52
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,960
so first things first um we need to name

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
them or else we could get very confused

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
very easily so you can name an object by

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
just double clicking it in the outliner

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,119
and then just typing in the object the

57
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,719
other way you can name something I'll

58
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,360
just show you the second way if you

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,598
select the

60
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,560
taurus1 that's your icing object if

61
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,400
you're in the 3D view where your cursor

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
sorry is over the 3D view Port if you

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,360
hit F2 that's another very quick way

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,200
that you can uh name something without

65
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,040
having to go out up to the outliner to

66
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,239
find your object so with our icing

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,599
object selected let's go into edit mode

68
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,360
by hitting tab so we want the icing on

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,120
the top which means this bottom half of

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,239
our mesh here is redundant don't need it

71
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,519
so we want to delete it so if we just

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
dragged over the bottom here you can see

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,959
it looks like we've selected the bottom

74
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,400
half of our donut but if you were to

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,239
move around you would see oh we haven't

76
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,239
actually it's only selected annoyingly

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,800
uh what is facing the camera where

78
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,159
there's a mesh it's not gone through the

79
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,120
mesh a lot of users find this uh

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,599
annoying I agree sometimes it's seems

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,480
like that would be the more default one

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,159
that would make more sense but anyway

83
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,440
don't want to argue

84
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,840
um so if you want to select through a

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
mesh you can go up to here in your your

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,120
top navigation toggle x-ray if you turn

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
that on it's going to enable you to see

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,879
through the mesh and now when I drag

89
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,319
over it you can see that I have uh

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
selected all through the mesh as I move

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
around it by the way you might find it

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,799
like when you're in this state it's kind

93
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,120
of hard to select like it's easy to kind

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,400
of accidentally select what is above it

95
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
and depending on what you've got at your

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,959
end that might have happened um already

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,280
so another way to easily just look

98
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,319
directly on the side on of your uh donut

99
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,040
is to just click one of these um like in

100
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,640
your Gizmo here instead of just dragging

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,959
around just do a single click on either

102
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,599
the green one or the red one the x or

103
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,560
the Y and now we're in that state you

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,360
can see it's it's flattened it so it's

105
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
put you in orthographic mode which

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
actually you can toggle to at any time

107
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,159
just over there which just makes it

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,840
easier to just do a single all the way

109
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,480
through the mesh um select all right

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,760
okay all right so we want to delete that

111
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,400
so just hit the delete key you get an

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
extra option here of what do you want to

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,959
delete edges faces you want the vertices

114
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,840
that's everything and now we have if we

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,640
go back to uh object mode and then let's

116
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,238
turn off toggle x-ray as well and you

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,639
can see it's uh it's working we got half

118
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,040
the the doughnut on top of itself but as

119
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,759
you move around you can see you got some

120
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
flickering now this flickering happens

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,199
and it's actually a very common it's

122
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,880
actually a good warning sign to you as

123
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,800
an artist cuz it means you've got uh

124
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,720
faces on top of faces and the 3D

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
software doesn't know which face it

126
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,360
wants to render right so it's like

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,880
sometimes saying it's the the front face

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,039
no the back face the front face and

129
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,039
there's no understanding sometimes you

130
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,800
can actually spot it in TV shows and

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,320
like VFX or like lowbudget stuff you can

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
see something flickering in the

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
background and I'm like ooh there it is

134
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
Z fighting um that's what it's called Z

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
Z fighting or Zed fighting if you're not

136
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
American so what we want to do is we

137
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,960
want to give uh thickness to our icing

138
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
so we can do that with a solidifier

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
modifier so adding another modifier make

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
sure you've got your icing selected not

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
your donut and then here where you've

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
got add modifier we're going to go

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,720
generate solidify okay now it's made it

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,759
worse it's uh it's actually added a

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,520
thickness to our uh mesh there but it's

146
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,280
actually done it the wrong way so it's

147
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,680
with the normals yeah what is it it's

148
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,759
trying to put the uh the extra bit

149
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,199
inside the dut so we can change that by

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,280
just changing the offset here in the

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
solidifier settings just drag that all

152
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,240
the way to one some of you might have

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
actually found that it was correct

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,000
before just depending on which way your

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,880
normals were if that's the case keep it

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
at minus one but everyone else keep it

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
at one we just want to make sure it's

158
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,919
actually outside okay um I also let's

159
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
just increase the thickness a little bit

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
too let's go here

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,120
0.25 that looks pretty good and uh great

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
we've got got what looks like a yarma on

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,800
our donut a perfectly

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,520
straightedge little hat for our donut so

165
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,880
let's make this look more like icing so

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
the edge is wavy all the way around so

167
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,880
to do this this is where we get into the

168
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,680
fancy ooh finger magic um cuz you're

169
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,000
typing lots of keys anyway um go into

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,599
edit mode and we can see straight away

171
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,160
that we can't see uh the man and that's

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,919
because the solidify modify is

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,919
obstructing our view so these little

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,400
boxes here as I mentioned before like

175
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,120
this is to hide it from viewport um but

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,319
if you want to just hide it from your

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,120
edit mode which is the state that we are

178
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,240
in right now the box next to it is the

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,199
one that you uh uncheck which means in

180
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,560
object mode when you're tabbed in object

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
mode you can still see it but edit mode

182
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,520
it's uh whoops it's temporarily hidden

183
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,280
for you so if I was to select one of

184
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
these points here and move it down you

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,400
can see that uh it's it's working but

186
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
but it would be again a lot of effort to

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,160
go round and round and do these one by

188
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,199
one so we want to use that uh old

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
familiar proportional fall-off tool

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,599
again so proportional editing on and now

191
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,479
as I move it down let's just uh let's

192
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,800
just lower the slide way down here and

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,319
then let's pull this down okay now we'll

194
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
find issues if we move to the side here

195
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,080
we can see the first issue we've

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,199
discovered is that this is separating

197
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,120
from our mesh here and that's not what

198
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
icing does when it dribbles down it

199
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
follows the shape of the D all the way

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
down so what we want to do is snap oops

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
undo it a number of times snap the uh

202
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,120
snap the vertices to our dut underneath

203
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,879
it right so for that we need to turn on

204
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,080
snapping up here okay now there are a

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,360
number of ways to snap in blender the

206
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,159
default way is increment which just

207
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,479
means the uh like the grid floor there

208
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,479
like if you were to just like move it

209
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,280
around you can see it's just snapping to

210
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,159
the grid floor not helpful but we want

211
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,240
to snap it to the face and now with face

212
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,720
snapping enabled if we move this down we

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
can see let's just look here that the

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,280
bottom bit is snapping to the face but

215
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,520
as you might have seen the top bits the

216
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,639
rest of uh essentially what is inside of

217
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,440
our circle of influence with this

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
proportional editing that's not being a

219
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
affected only the little point that we

220
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,599
had selected was affected so that's not

221
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,599
what we want either normally that would

222
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,319
be enough but in this particular case we

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,440
want to also snap individual elements to

224
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,479
and let's go face project now when we

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,559
pull this down you should see that these

226
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,320
are also no longer clipping through the

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,279
dut but still we have issues why is that

228
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,880
well it is actually working correctly we

229
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,320
can see these are not going through the

230
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,480
mesh so why does it look like it is the

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
reason for that is that there's actually

232
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
just not enough information here so if

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
we go side on you can see right like

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
we've got this Point uh here and then

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,200
we've got another Point down here and

236
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
then we've got this long stretch uh in

237
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,800
between right so that means that this

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
part of the Donut oh gosh that goes that

239
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
goes around like that is just not

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
there's nothing to snap it to

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
essentially so what we need to do to fix

242
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,279
this is just add more geometry so these

243
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
little vertices here we need more of

244
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
those vertices so we can do that by

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
actually using the subdivision

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,959
surface modifier cuzz although it is a

247
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,959
modifier you can apply the modifier and

248
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,560
the modifier currently is adding

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,240
geometry so let's just apply it so to

250
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,720
apply it we just click this little drop

251
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,760
down here next to the modifier and then

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,480
go apply now if we I mean nothing should

253
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
have changed from this view because the

254
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,399
same information is being displayed but

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,800
in edit mode you should now see

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,560
exponentially more faces cuz here where

257
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
there was uh you know one face before

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
you can see there's now a lot more right

259
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,519
d uh four 4X okay 4X um okay so now if

260
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,079
we pull down we should see it is

261
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,200
snapping and if we go into this mode you

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
can see that it's now conforming to the

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,079
mesh in a much more uh snug way cuz

264
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
there's information there for it to use

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
now this shading artifact here that we

266
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
can see this this don't worry about that

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,240
we'll fix that in just a moment but uh I

268
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,200
need to show cuz I've shown you like

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
four things that we need to enable for

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,279
this work I got to show you one more uh

271
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,959
because if I pull down and if I scroll

272
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,360
up you'll see something okay if I was to

273
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
click we get this horrible uh problem

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,240
here and I've done this tutorial and

275
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,880
enough and enough people have hit this

276
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,200
issue that I need to call it out

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
specifically because it seems to be a

278
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,200
big point that a lot of people just

279
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
don't know where to go from um what's

280
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,639
happened is if we use a uh this uh

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,720
what's it called the the the the circle

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,399
of influence for our proportional

283
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,160
editing if that is so high it's actually

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
high enough to reach the mesh on the

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
other side of the donut and then because

286
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,360
we've got snapping it's now projecting

287
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,720
that snapping it to the front which is

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,680
creating this like something that's a

289
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,639
nightmare to fix I me in fact it's

290
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,639
easier just to start from scratch than

291
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,839
to try to fix that so if we want sorry

292
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,000
there's a lot of noise uh to fix this we

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,279
need to hide the part of the mesh that

294
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,440
we don't want to be uh influenced by our

295
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,600
uh proportional tool right so to do that

296
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
there is an easy way to do it uh we can

297
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
actually do it very precisely so if with

298
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
this middle bit of our donut here if I

299
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,440
just hold down alt and then do a left

300
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,079
click as I mentioned before that selects

301
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,600
the ring okay and we could you know we

302
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,120
could do that all the way up but

303
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,880
actually there's a little uh I don't

304
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,480
know if it's an Easter egg it's kind of

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,519
a cool tool that not people know not

306
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
many people know about Control Plus H

307
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,320
that will enable these select more tool

308
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
and if you use control+ contrl minus

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
goes the other way you can see that it's

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
expanding out so Control Plus will just

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,279
like select the next verticy along a

312
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,760
chain roughly speaking um and you can

313
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,079
see we can very quickly select all the

314
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,079
parts of the mesh that we don't need

315
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,880
right very cool by the way if Control

316
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
Plus doesn't work for you cuz you're on

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,079
a laptop or something else select more

318
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,959
less you can also do it here anyways to

319
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,920
hide this part of the mesh it's h h for

320
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,959
hide so when you're in this state it

321
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,199
looks as though it's been deleted it's

322
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,079
very sometimes you don't know where part

323
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,199
of your mesh and then you forgot that

324
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,880
you've got hide turned on um if parts of

325
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
your mesh are hidden and you want to

326
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
bring it back it's alt H so H to hide

327
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,040
and then alt H to bring it back or if

328
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,399
you can't remember it for whatever

329
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,760
reason you can also find it okay it's

330
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,639
underneath mesh there we go mesh uh

331
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,880
reveal hidden or hide selected okay so

332
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,560
that's the other way but you can get my

333
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,279
keyboard shortcut that it's in the link

334
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,920
it's free just use that and then you

335
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,720
won't forget a lot of these handy

336
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,639
shortcuts all right so now finally after

337
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,079
all that after four different ways of

338
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
and problems to explain we can now take

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,199
part of this mesh and drag it down and

340
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,920
it will work correctly haha so now we

341
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,760
just make we get to now finally be an

342
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,880
artist and go like what sort of uh you

343
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,000
know Edge or you know what sort of icing

344
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
do I want to make this look like so what

345
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,279
I'm doing here by the way is I'm I'm h G

346
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,240
to pull it down and then I'm just middle

347
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,160
click single middle click and then

348
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,959
because my cursor is closest to the Zed

349
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
axis it's now snapping it to the Zed

350
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,600
axis so that's why I mentioned before

351
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,199
that it's uh it's really handy you don't

352
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,880
have to think of the letter and type it

353
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,760
in you just go in the general direction

354
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,320
you want to go and then just tap the

355
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,480
middle click of the uh which is your

356
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,000
your scroll wheel right middle middle

357
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
click it's such a weird uh button that

358
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,279
you have to call it out it's the scroll

359
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,279
wheel button cuz like no other

360
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,320
application seems to use it besides

361
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
scrolling but blender is like no we're

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,000
going to use it for like 90% of the

363
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,720
operations is going to be middle click

364
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,519
um but anyways I as you can see I'm not

365
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,959
paying particularly too much attention

366
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,079
to it but I'm just making a wavy looking

367
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,519
shape around it um you might also want

368
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,480
to make some bits that go the opposite

369
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,079
direction right and then maybe pull so

370
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,120
you've got like big shapes as well as

371
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,600
medium shapes and some small shapes big

372
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,920
medium small it's the uh it's the recipe

373
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
for appealing design big medium and

374
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
small details but uh I digress by the

375
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
way I should mention if you're stuck

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
don't feel bad cuz there was certainly a

377
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,079
lot of uh a lot of finickiness going on

378
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
with this donut here and uh it's yeah

379
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,079
it's a we're definitely in the Steep

380
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,279
part of that curve at the moment uh do

381
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,440
make use of my Discord if you are stuck

382
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
I created it literally so that people

383
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,880
could get instantaneous help I don't

384
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,040
have any other benefit for it so it's

385
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,639
there so that you can can find help link

386
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,320
is in the description and there's a

387
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,120
donut help chat room where you can post

388
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,839
screenshots of your problem and then

389
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,639
people can help each other out so do

390
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,759
make use of that now our shading issue

391
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,079
here this darkened Edge is actually

392
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,160
going to fix itself by fixing another

393
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,120
issue so it's a two birds one solution

394
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,120
kind of problem uh this 90° edge here

395
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,920
for this icing not ideal uh everybody

396
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,480
knows that a real icing would create

397
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
like a rounded Edge there right so we

398
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,079
can fix that just by adding another

399
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,959
subsurf modifier cuz you might remember

400
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,839
I mentioned like yes if you've got three

401
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,560
vertices it'll create like another

402
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
verticy here and another verticy here

403
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,360
but it'll also like round it out it'll

404
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,079
pull this one back so you end up with a

405
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,040
rounded corner so right here in your

406
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
modifier stack we're going to go add

407
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,880
modify generate subdivision surface now

408
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,319
the order of these does matter okay you

409
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,519
want your your solidifier at the top and

410
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,040
the subdivision after it so blender

411
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,399
Works top to bottom and it's important

412
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
it's in this way because you want the

413
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,040
Extrusion to happen first and then in

414
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,959
order to round that edge it happens has

415
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,720
to happen as a secondary step so

416
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,079
solidify on top subdivision underneath

417
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,279
now whilst we're here and we're looking

418
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,600
at the uh the closeup nice little

419
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,079
profile of this edge of this icing

420
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,319
another issue to call it you can see

421
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,600
it's got this uh this shape that goes

422
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,880
around yes so far so good but then it

423
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,319
goes up and it's like m it would be

424
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,279
better if it went around and then tucked

425
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,839
in and touched the edge of it cuz that

426
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,480
would look more like real liquid wood so

427
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,440
we can solve that by just changing one

428
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
of the settings in the solidify modify

429
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
it's not one of those things that you

430
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,319
would figure out or know where it is

431
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,839
it's just over time you learn where some

432
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,800
of these settings are but essentially

433
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
here the edge data so we want to change

434
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,880
the edge data to say that uh before you

435
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,160
do the solidify step add a crease on the

436
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,920
inner part right here if we increase

437
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
this all the way way to one it now

438
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,600
creates a sharpened Edge just on that

439
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
inner part there so the rest of it is a

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
smoothed Edge but the middle one there's

441
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,799
a crease so it's making a sharp edge

442
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,640
there and it just gives it just a little

443
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
bit more realism just looks a little bit

444
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,319
closer to what you would imagine real

445
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,599
icing would do okay now for the cool bit

446
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,640
all right so if you look at reference of

447
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,760
donuts right yes you've got these little

448
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,119
wavy bits but where the the icing is

449
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,799
really liquidy it'll often break off

450
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,960
from this wave here and it'll create a

451
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,320
trail that goes down uh underneath the

452
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,880
donut right it just sort of drips all

453
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
the way down whoops bump the microphone

454
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,360
so we can do that um but not what we the

455
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,520
way we were doing it before if we just

456
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,760
took one of these points and then like

457
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
dragged it all the way down like that

458
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,400
there wouldn't be enough information

459
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,600
there right you can see you just get

460
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,799
this like stretched look and it doesn't

461
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,840
look great okay so essentially we need

462
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
to give it more information and we

463
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,159
couldn't just do it by like adding more

464
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,520
and more subdivision servic we we need

465
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,440
to actually like break this shape here

466
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,520
and create a new shape that goes down so

467
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,799
we need to extrude so if I select this

468
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,400
verticy and then the one next to it by

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,880
holding down shift I don't think I

470
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,799
mentioned it but yeah if you want to

471
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,600
select two things at once it's shift

472
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,320
select um anyways so if we select two

473
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,200
vertices like that we want to extrude it

474
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,080
downward by hitting e so when you tap e

475
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,760
it's similar to G and that you're in a

476
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
placement State now saying where do you

477
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
want to place this so I'm going to move

478
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,360
it down to yeah like about there where I

479
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,240
want the trail to stop and I'm just

480
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,159
going to do click left click and it's

481
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,880
now placed it there now if I it's hard

482
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
to see it but if I just switch to YF

483
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,240
frame you can see what it's doing so

484
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,360
it's created this breakaway shape here

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,120
an entirely new face um that's

486
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,520
completely separate to what we've got

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,360
there

488
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,520
currently and what this means is if we

489
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,320
go to object mode you can see it's it's

490
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,880
not just like continuing this form here

491
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
it's pulled it Down Right which is uh

492
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,039
exactly what we want and in fact I

493
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,360
wanted to to go even further than that

494
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
so I'm going to select those two

495
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
vertices and I'm going to pull it down

496
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,880
again um and then I'll do it again and

497
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
the reason I've done this one two 3 is

498
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,000
that this detail here is important so

499
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,760
that it conforms to the shape of the dut

500
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,880
CU if there's not enough you're going to

501
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,360
have that clipping issue that I showed

502
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
you earlier so that's pretty good and

503
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
now we're going to do it again

504
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
originally in my earlier

505
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,720
version versions of the donut I only did

506
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,000
like one of these but then I noticed

507
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,360
that that in the render the final render

508
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,000
it's often the most interesting part of

509
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,520
the dut so now I'm thinking yeah just do

510
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,679
it all the way around the dut just uh

511
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
add the bit that looks cool add more of

512
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,679
that so here so wherever there's

513
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,679
essentially like a big dip is what I'm

514
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,559
looking for like where the the liquid

515
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,080
would sort of build up and then like the

516
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,960
surface tension there would be just too

517
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,840
much and then it would break away and it

518
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,080
would go

519
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,520
down down underneath like that and we'll

520
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,559
do another one here why

521
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,080
not like that and down and

522
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,440
down and that's pretty good haha lovely

523
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
so that concludes finally this this

524
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,840
heavy part of the tutorial so if you're
