1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,360
this is blender open-source 3D software

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,680
that can be used to make animations

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,799
visual effects game assets or

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,000
practically anything 3D and best of all

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,519
it's 100% free and it always will be if

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,119
you've never used it before but you want

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,000
to learn it well then you're in the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
right place this is a tutorial for

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
complete beginners I've been using

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,000
blender for 20 years so I'm going to

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,560
show you how to use all of its core

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
features and by the end you'll finish

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,599
with not only the confidence to start

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,200
your own projects but with your very own

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,719
dut animation and I know this looks

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,520
complex but I promise you it's

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,840
achievable for a complete beginner and I

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,600
say that with confidence because many

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,960
already have this is actually the fourth

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
version of this tutorial I made the

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,640
first dut tutorial back in 2016 and I've

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,920
been remaking it every few years to keep

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,039
up with blender's development in that

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,079
time millions of people just like

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,960
yourself have gone from having never

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,480
used 3D to successfully making their own

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
Donuts one arst even snuck his into a

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
little film called everything everywhere

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,479
all at once very clever so if you're

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
ready to take your first steps in 3D hit

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,920
the Subscribe button and let's begin

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,799
first go to blender.org download or just

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,000
click the link in the description then

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,360
obviously you got to hit the big

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
download button once downloaded on

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
Windows double click it and then just go

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
through the install steps but if you're

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
on a Mac just drag it into the

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,400
applications folder then just find the

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,560
blender shortcut and open it then once

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,439
it's open open just click anywhere off

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
the splash screen to close it and

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,759
welcome to the wonderful world of 3D

44
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,240
first tip do not get overwhelmed if you

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,880
go clicking around you might find lots

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,759
of buttons and some of them with very

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,479
scary names and it can all get very

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,360
overwhelming very quickly thing you need

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
to know is blunder can do a lot of

50
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
things which means it has a lot of tools

51
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,560
but you don't need to know every tool in

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,240
order to do what you want to do if

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,159
you're familiar with the 8020 rule

54
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,320
there's really only 20% of blender

55
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
features that you end up using 80% of

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,200
the time and that's what I'm planning to

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,320
teach you in this tutorial Series so

58
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
stay with me and you should be fine

59
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,160
we'll start making the donut in the next

60
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,878
video in this one we're just going to

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
look at the interface and I'm going to

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
show you some of the basic navigation so

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
for starters this view this window right

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,640
here is your 3D viewport and it's where

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,680
you'll spend probably 90% of your time

66
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,560
because it is the 3D World so you can

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,480
see that we have three objects here

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,560
we've got a camera we've got a cube and

69
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,840
we've got a lamp and when we click on it

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
you can see it's selected because it has

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,040
the yellow outline so let's delete the

72
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
default cube of course and replace it

73
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
with something else so we could do that

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,920
by going up to the add menu up here or

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,760
by remembering the hot key which is

76
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,159
shift a so shift a for add so usually

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,959
the one you're looking for is underneath

78
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,720
mesh so these are called your Primitives

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,000
and it's what you use to start something

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
when you're looking to uh make an object

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,879
like if you're going to make a chair you

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
might start with a cylinder as the chair

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,480
leg and then build out from there but

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,319
the one I'm sure you're all very curious

85
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,400
you want to click it it's the monkey so

86
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
let's just click the monkey why does

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
blender have a monkey well fun fact

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,840
every 3D software has its own little

89
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
random complex object because it's

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
useful to test things like shaders or

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
complexities of scenes so 3ds Max has

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
the Utah teapot Houdini has the toy and

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,120
I think Pig's head uh blenda has the

94
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,840
monkey and it's actually called the

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,599
suzan monkey head which you can see in

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
the top left there named after the

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,959
rangang from the film Jay and Silent Bob

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,879
Strikes Back random piece of trivia so

99
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,200
let's get a better look at it and to

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
that we need to orbit which you can do

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,439
by on your mouse there your scroll wheel

102
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,200
that is called your middle Mouse button

103
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,400
if you push that in and then drag around

104
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,360
that is now orbiting now for my laptop

105
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,840
users you've just panicked cuz you

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
realize you don't have a mouse how are

107
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,599
you going to orbit around first of all

108
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,720
probably good idea to get a Mouse for 3D

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,239
work it will come in handy um but in a

110
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,280
pinch you can get by without it just by

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,959
up here in the top right hand corner

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,000
this little gray Circle anywhere in the

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,319
gray section if you just left click drag

114
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,319
on that that will do the exact same

115
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,519
thing or if you want you can go to edit

116
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,120
preferences and then underneath input

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
there's emulate three button Mouse and

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,160
that means that if you hold down alt and

119
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,000
then left click drag that will do the

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,360
exact same thing also whilst you are in

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
user preferences you might want to go to

122
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,280
interface face and you've got resolution

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,600
scale if you're on a 4k monitor you

124
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
might find that your menus and buttons

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,280
are really small and you kind of have to

126
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,919
like squint in to see it so personally I

127
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,160
like to keep my 4k monitor around about

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,400
1.5 but since this is a tutorial I make

129
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,720
it nice and big so you can see what I'm

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
doing okay so that's orbiting around

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
with the middle Mouse button if we want

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
to zoom in we can do that just by

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
scrolling in and out we could also do it

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,919
by going up to the magnifying glass tool

135
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,880
there and then just left click dragging

136
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,919
and then moving the uh mouse back and

137
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,440
forth that does the same thing or you

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,400
could hold down control and then middle

139
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,520
Mouse button and that will do a smooth

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
Zoom as well okay so one thing you might

141
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
notice looking at this is that it's not

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
very pretty right it's just kind of got

143
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,120
this flat Bland gray lighting over

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,000
everything and that's because this state

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,560
right now is called viewport shading and

146
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
it's kind of a lightweight optimized way

147
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
to view the scene just as you're

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,080
building it but if you want to create a

149
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,280
final pretty image that's called r ring

150
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,960
and you can actually switch into

151
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,120
rendered mode by going up here into the

152
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,080
top right hand corner you can see we're

153
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
currently in the viewport shading mode

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
if we go to across you should see render

155
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,840
View mode so if we click that your

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
computer might stall for a quick second

157
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
whilst it loads it in but you can see

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,680
it's now different we have directional

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,759
light we have shadow cast across the

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,360
monkey so it's now currently being lit

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,039
by this lamp up here so if I wanted to

162
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,840
uh you know zoom in on that lamp lamp

163
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,800
there and just kind of like move it

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
around you can see it's kind of hard to

165
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,120
focus on like it's always exactly not in

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
the right View and that's because we are

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
centered on our monkey right now we need

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,160
to change the focus we need to pan to

169
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,759
something else so we could do that one

170
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,160
of two ways one if you're on a laptop

171
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
you could use a little move tool there

172
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,680
that will do that or everyone else shift

173
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,000
middle Mouse click drag that will do the

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
same thing so middle Mouse is for

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,240
orbiting shift middle Mouse is for pan

176
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,080
to change your view to something else

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
okay so I want to move my light because

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
it's uh it's too Moody I want to be able

179
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
to see the monkey's face there so to

180
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,000
move an object you could do it one of

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
two ways one you could go over to the

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,280
left hand corner here and you've got the

183
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,520
move tool when you click that you can

184
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,840
see that the selected object the lamp

185
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
has this uh this Gizmo it's called with

186
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,759
these axes on it and if I just clicked

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
and dragged on any of those arrows there

188
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,120
you can see I can move it along any of

189
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
those axes I could also just click on

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,039
that uh white circle there and that will

191
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,479
just freehand drag it um depending on my

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,240
view but it's kind of tedious every time

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,319
you want to move something you have to

194
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,120
like go to that tool and then find the

195
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
arrows and yada yada so actually most

196
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,039
people in blender prefer to use the hot

197
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
keys so we just keep it in the default

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,000
selection State here and instead

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,199
remember the hot key which is G for grab

200
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,080
now I've just tapped the key and you'll

201
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,199
notice as I move my cursor that it's now

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,720
attached to my cursor it's not my cursor

203
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,280
isn't even actually close to it in fact

204
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,919
my cursor could be on the other side of

205
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,560
the screen and I could tap G and it will

206
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
move it and at first this is kind of

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
awkward you're like why is it working

208
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
this way but once you get used to it you

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
realize it's actually handy because you

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
don't have to spend all this time like

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,720
navigating your cursor to something just

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
so that you can move it your cursor

213
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,159
could be over here and then just tap it

214
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,840
and you're moving it so whilst you're in

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
this move state if you want to cancel a

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,639
movement you can do it one of two ways

217
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,120
you could just hit Escape or you could

218
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,720
rightclick then if you want to confirm a

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
movement like say I want to move my lamp

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,599
here and I like the movement I could

221
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,319
just do a single left click so again if

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
I want to cancel something just right

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
click if I want to confirm the movement

224
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,159
left click but let's say I wanted to

225
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,280
move it along an axis like you know I

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,639
like these arrows here and I want to be

227
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,000
able to move it on just a specific axis

228
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,039
well I can do that whilst I'm in that

229
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
grab State as well so after I have hit

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,919
the g key to grab it I can then tap the

231
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,240
letter of the axes that I want to move

232
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,960
it on so if you don't know in the real

233
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
world and in the 3D software there are

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
three axis cuz there's three dimensions

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,640
there's the x axis which I can move it

236
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
by hitting the X key the y axis to move

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,919
it back and forth along the Y AIS with

238
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,719
the y key or the Zed axis to move it up

239
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,000
and down on the Zed axis so you can

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
remember those uh those letters the X Y

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,720
and Zed or the method that I actually

242
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,839
prefer to use is whilst you're in that g

243
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,720
state if you just hold down the middle

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Mouse button and then pull out you can

245
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,959
see you get this like Gray Line that

246
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
pulls out from the center and then if

247
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
you just drag out and move around it

248
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
will snap it to the nearest axis which

249
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
again is maybe an odd way to work but

250
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,959
it's actually really handy because it

251
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,000
means you don't have to think of the the

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
letter and locate it on your keyboard I

253
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
can just tap G to move it and then

254
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
middle Mouse drag out and then just find

255
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,160
that exact axis that I'm looking for and

256
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,240
so it's very fast to just quickly move

257
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,920
the lamp exactly where I want it by the

258
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
way if you're finding it hard to

259
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
remember all of the keyboard shortcuts

260
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,079
that I've mentioned I've actually put

261
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,279
together a PDF a cheat sheet of

262
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,600
blender's most common hotkeys and you

263
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,240
can download that by clicking the link

264
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,880
in the description so you could print it

265
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
out or you could just have it on a

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,399
separate monitor while you work also if

267
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,519
you are from another 3D software package

268
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,480
you might notice that blenders hotkeys

269
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,519
are different than what you are used to

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
so if you actually go to preferences

271
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,079
just for those people that are from

272
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:53,120
other softwares if you change the key

273
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
map to Industry compatible you'll find

274
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,480
that these shortcuts are probably more

275
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
in line with what you remember from

276
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
other software

277
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,399
I'll also put a link to a cheat sheet

278
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,000
that is just for the industry compatible

279
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
keymaps that somebody else put together

280
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
I've got nothing to do with it but I'll

281
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
put that link there so you can check it

282
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
out as well for the rest of this

283
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,279
tutorial series I'm going to use

284
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,560
blender's hotkeys just keep that in mind

285
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
now let's say as I am moving around here

286
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm like oh this looks really good I've

287
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
got some nice REM lighting across the

288
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,360
monkeyy face I want to take a photo I

289
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,600
want to take a nice pretty image of this

290
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,880
and post it on socials for clout right

291
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,600
well I could take a screenshot shot of

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
it but that would be silly cuz it's got

293
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,079
all these lines all over it's all noisy

294
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,560
right we don't like it the way you take

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,920
a photo a pretty image in letter is to

296
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,240
do a render so you could do that one or

297
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,800
two ways by going up to render and

298
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,000
hitting render image or remembering the

299
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,160
hot key which says next to it

300
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,760
F12 so when you do that a little window

301
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,040
will pop up it will use your CPU or GPU

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,399
depending on which renderer you've got

303
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
active and it will render out a pretty

304
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,360
image and from here you could go image

305
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
and then save as and that'll save it as

306
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,320
PNG or whatever wherever you want to

307
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
save it but you might notice looking at

308
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
this that this is actually a different

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,920
view than what we have here right so

310
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
here I've got a nice view of the

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,639
monkey's face but up there was a

312
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,959
different View and the reason for that

313
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,160
is when you do a render it's not

314
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,200
rendering from The View that you're

315
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
looking at currently it's always going

316
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,519
to render from the point of view of the

317
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,480
camera so this is our camera over here

318
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
and it's looking from this angle and we

319
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,920
can actually look through the camera by

320
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,639
just clicking the little camera icon

321
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,959
there or by remembering the hotkey which

322
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,200
is number pad Z

323
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,399
zero so how do we move the camera well

324
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,880
blender is a little awkward maybe a

325
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
little different to other software

326
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,279
packages but you're supposed to like hit

327
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,639
G to move it and then like middle Mouse

328
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,600
to zoom in and out and then if you want

329
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
to like move it along an axis I guess g

330
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,639
and then X you could do that but

331
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,279
actually what a lot of users prefer

332
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,600
especially those from other software

333
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,760
packages is if you've got your camera

334
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,320
selected which by the way I haven't

335
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
mentioned this but up here this is your

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
outliner it's kind of an inventory of

337
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
every item that you've got in your scene

338
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,240
okay so with the camera there selected

339
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,320
if I hit n n is to bring up the

340
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,920
properties n for properties for whatever

341
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,639
reason um and then go to view there's a

342
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,480
little box there that just says lock to

343
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,880
camera to view so now with that active

344
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,440
if I just use the same keyboard

345
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
shortcuts as before middle Mouse button

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,320
to orbit around shift middle Mouse to

347
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,279
drag it you can see that the camera is

348
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,720
moving with it so essentially the view I

349
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,440
can set it up exactly as I want then hit

350
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,199
n again and then I can disable that and

351
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,920
then now as I pull out you can see the

352
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,839
camera will stay exactly where it was

353
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,079
and I could do a lovely pretty render

354
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
but this is too simple if we post this

355
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,120
on the internet people are bound to make

356
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,800
fun of us imagine that well we could

357
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,639
give it some color right so with our

358
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,000
monkey head selected we can go over to

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
here to the properties so this

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,800
properties section is where you might

361
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,120
spend the other I don't know another

362
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,079
eight five to 8% I don't know getting

363
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,920
too exact there you might spend another

364
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,399
5% of your time in this section but it's

365
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,880
where all of the properties for things

366
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,360
are in blender so for example you've got

367
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,240
uh like the render properties like the

368
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
size of the image that you're saving

369
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,040
something as is defined there and some

370
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,519
of these properties will stay here um no

371
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,920
matter what is selected but others are

372
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,120
selection dependent so you can see

373
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,000
actually if I click the camera there you

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,120
can see I get a little camera tab at the

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
bottom there but if I select my monkey

376
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,839
you'll see the camera tab disappears but

377
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,320
instead I have some other ones that

378
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,760
appear so one that we might want to

379
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
change is underneath material and this

380
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
will enable us to add a

381
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,959
material change the color to something

382
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,279
else essentially so underneath here

383
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,040
where it's got new I'm just going to hit

384
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,639
new and then you've got a bunch of

385
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
options very conf o i subsurface again

386
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
don't worry about it we'll get to all of

387
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,519
that later on the one that defines the

388
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,040
color is is the base color so if I do a

389
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,399
single left click on that white box

390
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,759
there I can then change this color to

391
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,360
whatever I want I could uh make it an

392
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,759
odd creepy skin toned monkey head right

393
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,440
like that and do a random okay so hey

394
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
all right it's better but still it's too

395
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
simple I think people will think we

396
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,959
haven't put enough effort into this uh

397
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,839
Masterpiece so let's add another object

398
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,880
let's give the monkey a hack so if we

399
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
want to add another object how do we do

400
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
it well we could go to the add menu like

401
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,440
I mentioned before or the hotkey shift

402
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,600
a so what sort of hat do we want to add

403
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,639
we could do a boxy hat uh let's do a

404
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,800
party hat with a cone so once we've

405
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,120
added that object you can see it's just

406
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,480
plopped it straight in the center

407
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,800
intersecting our monkey so we need to

408
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,279
move it can move it and we could grab it

409
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,160
with the G key so it's now moving it

410
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,079
just on our cursor there I don't want to

411
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,720
move it just freehand though cuz I like

412
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
the position but I just want to move it

413
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,440
up so I'm going to hit Zed to move it

414
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,680
along the Zed axis right I like it there

415
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,160
so once I like the placement I'm just

416
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,040
going to do a single left click okay

417
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,440
great but too big oh so see need to

418
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,839
learn another tool which is scale so we

419
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,720
could go to the scale tool there and

420
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,440
then we get this familiar um little axes

421
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,000
there but again most people prefer to

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,279
remember the hotkey which for scale is

423
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,839
just s so s to scale so resizing that

424
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,920
okay that's pretty good let's move it

425
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,800
down again so G and Zed okay all right

426
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,120
but yeah let's say we want to make it a

427
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
little taller okay so we could scale it

428
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,639
along just the Z axis so s and then Zed

429
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,519
whoops s z there we go and it's now

430
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,279
making it a tall party hat scale it down

431
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,399
there we go ha look at that be a very

432
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,199
Bland party if it's gray though so let's

433
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,120
give it another material an exciting

434
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
color a vibrant uh

435
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
aqua color why not give that a render by

436
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,040
hitting F12 okay camera is in the wrong

437
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
position so let's go to camera view mode

438
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,519
with number pad zero I'm going to select

439
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,920
my camera and rather than dabbling with

440
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
that little thing I had before I'm going

441
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
to hit G and then middle Mouse just tap

442
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,160
it once as I said it's a little awkward

443
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,800
blend is um the way it handles with the

444
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,440
camera but anyway just uh move that out

445
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,920
and then uh I got to rotate it done all

446
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,480
right so I'm going to rotate so with the

447
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,560
camera selected tap r then middle Mouse

448
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,199
and it's now kind of like free hand

449
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
rotating around so I'll just uh move it

450
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,800
up slightly there we go okay this is

451
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,319
this is just a full around session so

452
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,519
don't worry if you're making mistakes

453
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,319
we'll get to actual practical building

454
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,399
stuff in the next part I'm just trying

455
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
to find ways to throw in these like

456
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,040
fundamental tools rotate right the

457
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,240
monkey's head is just he needs to look

458
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,959
dead on at the camera and currently he's

459
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,959
off ah what an excuse to use the rotate

460
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,520
tool so you could enable the rotate tool

461
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
right The Familiar axes there you could

462
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,959
click and rotate it around like that

463
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,400
again most people prefer to remember the

464
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,119
hotkey which is R to rotate right so

465
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,799
it's now just freehand rotating on my

466
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,720
cursor remember the uh the axis as I

467
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
mentioned before can be used for any

468
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,959
mode so uh the x axis will rotate it

469
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,119
back and forth the Y AIS tilt it or Zed

470
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
there we go to turn it towards the

471
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,919
camera just a little bit right and there

472
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,840
you go F12 and we've done it let's save

473
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,919
it let's upload it to Art station and

474
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,440
then just wait for the recruiters

475
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,160
essentially all right let's start a new

476
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,559
scene so that we can get ready for part

477
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,400
two where we're going to actually start

478
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,080
building our donut and learning some of

479
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,360
the more core features of blender so

480
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,039
click here and I will see you in part

481
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,039
two
